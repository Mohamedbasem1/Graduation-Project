m-0000	Surat Al-Fatihah This surah is called Al-Fatihah because it opens the great Quran. It is called Al-Mathani because it is recited in every rak'ah. It has other names. Begin reading the Quran in the name of Allah, seeking His help. Allah is the name of the Lord, Blessed and Exalted be He, the One truly worshipped, and none other than Him. It is the most special of Allah’s names, and no one else is called by it. Glory be to Him, the Most Gracious, the Possessor of General Mercy, Whose mercy encompasses all creation, the Most Merciful to the believers. These are two of His names, the Most High, which include affirming the attribute of mercy for Allah, the Most High, as befits His Majesty. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds. Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, praise be to Allah for His attributes, all of which are descriptions of perfection, and for His apparent and hidden blessings, religious and worldly. It includes an order to His servants to praise Him, for He alone is deserving of it. He, Glory be to Him, is the Creator of creation, the One who takes care of their affairs, the One who nurtures all of His creation with His blessings, and His friends with faith and righteous deeds. The Most Gracious, Whose mercy encompasses all of creation, the Most Merciful to the believers. These are two of Allah’s names. He, Glory be to Him, is the Owner of the Day of Resurrection, which is the Day of Recompense for deeds. In the Muslim’s recitation of this verse in every One rak’ah of his prayers is a reminder to him of the Last Day and an encouragement to him to prepare by doing good deeds and refraining from sins and bad deeds.
m-0001	We dedicate worship to You alone and seek Your help alone in all our affairs. The whole matter is in Your hand and no one possesses an atom’s weight of it. This verse is evidence that the servant is not permitted to devote any type of worship such as supplication, seeking help, slaughtering, and circumambulation except to Allah alone. In it is healing for the hearts from the disease of attachment to other than Allah and from the diseases of hypocrisy, conceit, and pride. Guide us, direct us, and grant us success to the straight path and make us steadfast on it until we meet You, which is Islam, which is the clear path that leads to the pleasure of Allah and to His Paradise, which was indicated by the Seal of His Messengers and Prophets, Muhammad, may Allah’s prayers and peace be upon him. There is no path to the servant’s happiness except by being steadfast on it.
m-0002	The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor from among the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, for they are the people of guidance and righteousness. Do not make us among those who follow the path of those who incurred Your wrath, those who knew the truth but did not act upon it, and they are the Jews and those who were like them, and the misguided, and they are those who were not guided and lost their way, and they are the Christians and those who followed their way. In this supplication there is healing for the heart of the Muslim from the disease of ingratitude, ignorance, and misguidance, and evidence that the greatest blessing of all is the blessing of Islam. Whoever knows the truth and follows it is more deserving of the straight path. There is no doubt that the companions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, are the most deserving of that after the prophets, peace be upon them. The verse indicates their virtue and great status, may Allah be pleased with them. It is recommended for the reader to say in the prayer after reciting Al-Fatihah, Amen, and its meaning is O Allah, answer, and it is not a verse from Surat Al-Fatihah by consensus of the scholars, and for this reason they unanimously agreed not to write it in the Qur’an.
m-0003	These letters and other disconnected letters at the beginning of the surahs indicate the miraculous nature of the Qur’an. The polytheists were challenged by it and were unable to oppose it. It is composed of these letters that make up the Arabic language. The Arabs’ inability to produce anything like it, even though they are the most eloquent of people, indicates that the Qur’an is a revelation from God. This Qur’an is the great book that is undoubtedly from God. It is not right for anyone to doubt it because of its clarity. The righteous benefit from it with beneficial knowledge and righteous deeds. They are the ones who fear God and follow His rulings.
m-0004	They are those who believe in the unseen that their senses and minds alone cannot perceive because it is only known through the revelation of Allah to His Messengers, such as belief in the angels, Paradise, Hell, and other things that Allah has informed us of or that His Messenger has informed us of. Belief is a comprehensive word for acknowledging Allah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and destiny, both good and bad, and believing in the acknowledgment by word and action with the heart, tongue, and limbs. Along with their belief in the unseen, they maintain performing the prayer at its appointed times, performing it correctly according to what Allah has prescribed for His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And from the money We have given them, they give out the obligatory and recommended charity of their money. And those who believe in what has been revealed to you, O Messenger, of the Qur’an and in what has been revealed to you of wisdom, which is the Sunnah, and in everything that was revealed to the Messengers before you of books such as the Torah, the Gospel, and others, and they believe in the abode of life after death and what is in it of accountability and recompense, believing in their hearts and appearing on their tongues and limbs. The Day of Resurrection was singled out because belief in it is one of the greatest motivations for doing acts of obedience, avoiding forbidden things, and holding oneself accountable. Those with these qualities are on the right path. With the light of their Lord and with the success of their Creator and Guide, they are the victorious ones who achieved what they sought and escaped the evil from which they fled.
m-0005	Indeed, those who have denied what was revealed to you from your Lord out of arrogance and transgression - faith will never come from them, whether you frighten them and warn them of the punishment of Allah or leave that alone because of their persistence in their falsehood. Allah has sealed the hearts of these people and their hearing and put a veil over their eyes because of their disbelief and stubbornness after the truth has become clear to them. So He did not guide them to guidance. And for them is a severe punishment in the fire of Hell.
m-0006	"And among the people is a group that hesitates in confusion between the believers and the disbelievers. They are the hypocrites who say with their tongues, “We believe in God and the Last Day,” while inwardly they are liars who have not believed. They believe in their ignorance that they are deceiving God and those who believe by showing faith and concealing disbelief. They only deceive themselves because the consequences of their deception will come back to them. Due to their extreme ignorance, they do not feel that because of the corruption of their hearts. In their hearts is doubt and corruption, so they are afflicted with sins that require their punishment. So God has increased their doubt, and they will have a painful punishment because of their lies and hypocrisy. And when they are advised to stop spreading corruption on earth through disbelief and sins, and divulging the secrets of the believers and befriending the disbelievers, they say falsely and argumentatively, “We are only the people of reform.” What they do and claim is reform is the very essence of corruption, but due to their ignorance and stubbornness, they do not feel it. And when it is said to the hypocrites, “Believe like the faith of the Companions, which is faith with the heart, tongue, and limbs,” they argue and say, “Should we believe like the belief of those who are weak in mind and opinion?” So we and they are equal in foolishness. God responds to them by saying, Foolishness is limited to them and they do not know that what they are in is misguidance and loss.These hypocrites, when they meet the believers, say: We believe in Islam just like you. But when they turn away and go to their disbelieving leaders who rebel against Allah, they confirm to them that they are on the religion of disbelief and have not abandoned it, but they were belittling the believers and mocking them.Allah mocks them and gives them respite so that they may become more misguided, confused and hesitant, and He punishes them for mocking the believers.These hypocrites sold themselves in a losing deal, so they took disbelief and abandoned faith, so they gained nothing, but rather they lost guidance. This is the clear loss."
m-0007	The state of the hypocrites who believed outwardly but not inwardly in the message of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, then disbelieved and began to stumble in the darkness of their misguidance, not realizing it and without any hope of getting out of it, is like the state of a group on a dark night, and one of them lit a huge fire for warmth and illumination, but when the fire shone and illuminated what was around him, it went out and became dark, so its people were left in darkness, not seeing anything and not being guided to a path or a way out. They are deaf to hearing the truth with contemplation, dumb to speaking it, blind to seeing the light of guidance, so they are unable to return to the faith they abandoned and have replaced it with misguidance. Or the state of another group of hypocrites, to whom the truth is apparent at one time and they doubt it at another time, is like the state of a group walking in the open, and a heavy rain falls upon them, accompanied by darknesses one upon the other, with the clapping of thunder, the flashing of lightning, and the burning thunderbolts that make them, out of the intensity of the terror, put their fingers in their ears in fear of destruction, and God Almighty encompasses the disbelievers, they do not escape Him nor are they able to defeat Him. Lightning is so intense that it takes away their sight, yet whenever it shines for them they walk in its light, and when it disappears, the road becomes dark for them and they stop in their places. And if God had not given them respite, He would have taken away their hearing and sight. And He is able to do that at all times. Indeed, He is over all things competent.
m-0008	A call from God to all mankind to worship God who raised you with His blessings and fear Him and do not disobey His religion, for He created you from nothing and created those before you so that you may be among the righteous, with whom God is pleased and who are pleased with Him. Your Lord is He who made the earth a carpet for you to make your life easy on it and the sky well-built and sent down rain from the clouds and brought forth for you thereby various colors of fruits and types of plants as provision for you. So do not make peers for God in worship while you know that He is unique in creation and provision and that He deserves servitude.
m-0009	And if you, O stubborn disbelievers, are in doubt about the Qur’an that We revealed to Our servant Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and you claim that it is not from God, then produce a surah that is similar to a surah from the Qur’an and seek help from whomever you are able of your helpers, if you are truthful in your claim. If you are unable now and you will inevitably be unable in the future, then fear the Fire by believing in the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and obeying God Almighty. This Fire, whose fuel is people and stones, has been prepared for those who disbelieve in God and His Messengers.
m-0010	And inform, O Messenger, the people of faith and righteous deeds of news that will fill them with joy that they will have in the Hereafter wondrous gardens with rivers flowing beneath their tall palaces and shady trees. Whenever God provides them with a type of delicious fruit, they will say, “God has provided us with this type before.” But when they taste it, they will find it to be something new in taste and deliciousness, even if it resembles the previous one in color, appearance, and name. And they will have in Paradise wives who are purified from all types of physical impurity, such as urine and menstruation, and moral impurity, such as lying and bad character. They will be in Paradise and its delights forever, they will not die in it nor will they leave it.
m-0011	Allah the Almighty is not ashamed to mention anything, whether small or large, even if it is an example of a small thing such as a mosquito, a fly, or something similar that Allah has given as an example, due to the inability of everything that is worshipped besides Allah. As for the believers, they know Allah’s wisdom in giving examples of small and large creatures from His creation. As for the disbelievers, they mock and say, “What does Allah mean by giving an example of these insignificant insects?” Allah answers them by saying that what is meant is a test and to distinguish the believer from the disbeliever. Therefore, Allah diverts many people from the truth with this example because they mock it, and He guides others to more faith and guidance through it. Allah the Almighty does not wrong anyone, because He does not divert from the truth except those who disobey Him. Those who break the covenant of Allah that He took from them regarding monotheism and obedience, and He has confirmed it by sending the messengers and revealing the books, and they disobey the religion of Allah, such as severing family ties and spreading corruption on earth. Those are the losers in this world and the Hereafter.
m-0012	How do you, O polytheists, deny the Oneness of God Almighty and associate others with Him in worship, while there is conclusive proof of this in yourselves? You were dead, and He created you and breathed life into you. Then He will cause you to die after the expiration of the terms He has set for you. Then He will bring you back alive on the Day of Resurrection. Then to Him you will be returned for reckoning and recompense. God alone is the One Who created for you all that is on the earth of blessings from which you benefit. Then He intended to create the heavens, and He made them seven heavens. And He is Knowing of all things. His knowledge, glory be to Him, encompasses all that He has created.
m-0013	And remember, O Messenger, when your Lord said to the angels, “Indeed, I will make upon the earth a people who will succeed one another to populate it.” They said, “O our Lord, teach us and guide us. What is the wisdom in creating these people, even though their nature is to cause corruption upon the earth and shed blood unjustly and aggressively? We are at Your command. We glorify You with the glorification befitting Your praise and majesty, and we praise You with all the attributes of perfection and majesty.” God said to them, “Indeed, I know what you do not know of the profound wisdom in their creation.” And as a clarification of the virtue of Adam, peace be upon him, God taught him the names of all things, then he presented their names to the angels, saying to them, “Tell Me the names of these beings if you are truthful in that you are more deserving of succession on the earth than they are.” The angels said, “We glorify You, O our Lord. We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, You alone are the Knower of the affairs of Your creation, the Wise in Your management.” God said, “O Adam, tell them the names of these things that they were unable to know.” So when Adam told them, God said to the angels, “I have informed you that I know what is hidden from you in the heavens and the earth.” I know what you reveal and what you conceal.
m-0014	And remember, O Messenger, to the people, God’s honoring of Adam when He, the Most High, said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam,” in honor of him and to show His favor. They all obeyed, except for Iblis, who refused to prostrate out of arrogance and envy, so he became one of those who denied God and disobeyed His command. And God said, “O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and enjoy its fruits in a pleasant and spacious manner wherever you wish. But do not approach this tree lest you fall into disobedience and become among those who transgress God’s command.” So Satan caused them to fall into sin by whispering to them until they ate from the tree, which caused them to be expelled from Paradise and its pleasures. And God said to them, “Descend to the earth, some of you being enemies of others,” meaning Adam, Eve, and Satan. And you will have on the earth a place of stability, residence, and benefit from what is in it until the time of your appointed times ends. So Adam accepted the words that God inspired in him, repentance and seeking forgiveness, which are His, the Most High, saying, “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.” 723 So God repented. And He forgave him his sin. Indeed, He is the Accepter of Repentance to those of His servants who repent, the Most Merciful to them. God said to them, “Descend from Paradise, all of you, and there will come to you and your descendants that which will guide you to the truth. So whoever acts upon it, there will be no fear concerning them regarding what they will encounter in the Hereafter, nor will they grieve over what they have missed of worldly matters.” And those who denied and belied Our recited verses and the proofs of Our Oneness - those are the ones who will abide in the Fire; they will abide therein eternally, never emerging from it.
m-0015	O descendants of Jacob, remember My many blessings upon you and be grateful to Me and fulfill My commandment to you by believing in My Books and My Messengers all together and by acting according to My laws. If you do that, I will fulfill for you what I promised you of mercy in this world and salvation in the Hereafter. And I alone am I, so fear Me and beware of My vengeance if you break the covenant and disbelieve in Me. And believe, O Children of Israel, in the Qur’an that I revealed to Muhammad, the Prophet of God and His Messenger, in agreement with what you know of the authentic Torah. And do not be the first group of the People of the Book to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My verses for a small price from the fleeting debris of this world. And I alone am I, so act in obedience to Me and abandon disobedience to Me. And do not mix the truth that I have made clear to you with the falsehood that you have fabricated. And beware of concealing the clear truth of the description of the Prophet of God and His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, which is in your books, and you find it written with you in what you know of the books that are in your hands. And enter the religion of Islam by establishing prayer in the correct manner as it was brought by the Prophet Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and pay the obligatory zakat in the prescribed manner and be with those who bow down from his nation, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. How ugly is your state and the state of your scholars when you command people to do good deeds and leave yourselves and do not command them to do the great good, which is Islam, and you read the Torah, which contains the attributes of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the obligation to believe in him. Do you not use your minds correctly? And seek help in all your affairs with patience in all its forms, as well as prayer, and it is difficult except for the humble. Those who fear Allah and hope for what is with Him and are certain that they will meet their Lord, the Most High, after death and that they will return to Him on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning and reward. O descendants of Jacob, remember My many blessings upon you and thank Me for them and remember that I have favored you over the scholars of your time with the abundance of prophets and revealed books such as the Torah and the Gospel. And fear the Day of Resurrection, the day when no one will avail anyone else in the least, and Allah will not accept intercession for the disbelievers, nor will He accept ransom from them, even if it were all the wealth of the earth and No one has the power to come forward on this day to help them and save them from torment.
m-0016	And remember Our favor upon you when We saved you from the tyranny of Pharaoh and his followers, who were making you taste the most severe torment, slaughtering your sons and leaving your daughters to serve and be humiliated. In that, there is a test for you from your Lord, and in saving you from him, there is a great favor that requires thanking God Almighty in all your ages and generations. And remember Our favor upon you when We parted the sea because of you and made dry paths in it so that you crossed, and We saved you from Pharaoh and his soldiers and from destruction in the water. But when Pharaoh and his soldiers entered your paths, We destroyed them in the water before your eyes. And remember Our favor upon you when We appointed forty nights for Moses to send down the Torah as guidance and light for you, and then you seized the opportunity of his absence for this short period and made the calf that you made with your own hands your god instead of God. This is the most heinous disbelief in God, and you are wrongdoers by taking the calf as a god. Then We overlooked this reprehensible act and accepted your repentance after the return of Moses, hoping that you would thank God for His blessings and favors and not continue. In disbelief and tyranny
m-0017	"And remember Our favor upon you when We gave Moses the Book that distinguishes between truth and falsehood, which is the Torah, so that you may be guided from misguidance.

And remember Our favor upon you when Moses said to his people, “You have wronged yourselves by taking the calf as a god, so repent to your Creator by killing one another.” This is better for you with your Creator than eternal life in the Fire. So you complied with that, so God bestowed favor upon you by accepting your repentance. He is the Accepter of Repentance for those of His servants who repent, the Most Merciful to them.

And remember when you said, “O Moses, we will not believe you that the words we hear from you are the words of God until we see God with our own eyes.” So a fire came down from the sky, and you saw it with your own eyes, and it killed you because of your sins and your audacity towards God Almighty.

Then We revived you after your death with a thunderbolt so that you may be grateful for God’s favor upon you. This death is a punishment for them. Then God resurrected them to complete their appointed times.

And remember Our favor upon you when you were wandering in the land, when We made the clouds shade you from the heat of the sun and sent down upon you manna, which is something similar to gum, its taste is Like honey, and We sent down to you quails, which are birds similar to quails, and We said to you, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you and do not contradict your religion,” but you did not comply. And they did not wrong Us by being ungrateful for the blessings, but they were wronging themselves, because the consequences of injustice will return to them."
m-0018	"And remember Our favor upon you when We said, ""Enter the city of Jerusalem and eat from its good things in any place therein with enjoyment, and be upon your entry submissive to Allah, humbled before Him, and say, ""Our Lord, remove from us our sins; We will respond to you and pardon and conceal them from you."" And We will increase the doers of good in their deeds in goodness and reward. But the unjust and misguided among the Children of Israel changed the word of Allah and distorted the word and the deed together, when they entered crawling on their backsides and said, ""A grain in a hair,"" and mocked the religion of Allah. So Allah sent down upon them a punishment from the sky because of their rebellion and their departure from the obedience of Allah."
m-0019	And remember Our favor upon you while you were thirsty in the wilderness when Moses called upon Us in humility to give his people drink, and We said, “Strike the rock with your staff.” So he struck, and there gushed forth from it twelve springs, the number of the tribes, informing each tribe of its own spring so that they would not dispute. And We said to them, “Eat and drink from the provision of Allah and do not strive upon the earth to cause corruption.” And remember when We sent down upon you sweet food and delicious birds, but you were arrogant with the favor as was your custom, and distress and boredom afflicted you, so you said, “O Moses, we will not be patient with fixed food that does not change with the days, so call upon your Lord to bring forth for us from the plants of the earth food from legumes and vegetables and cucumbers and grains that are eaten and lentils and onions.” Moses said, denouncing them, “Do you seek these foods that are less valuable and leave this beneficial provision that Allah has chosen for you? Go down from this desert to any city where you will find what you desire most in the fields and markets.” And when they went down, it became clear to them that they give precedence to their own choice in every place over the choice of Allah and prefer their desires over what Allah has chosen. For this reason, they were subjected to the attribute of humiliation and poverty of souls, and they turned away and returned in anger from God for turning away from the religion of God and because they disbelieved in the signs of God and killed the prophets unjustly and aggressively, and this was due to their disobedience and transgression of the limits of their Lord. The believers of this nation who believed in God and His messengers and acted according to His law, and those who were before the mission of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, from the previous nations of the Jews, Christians, and Sabians, and they were people who remained on their nature and did not follow a religion established for them, all of these, if they believed in God with a true and sincere belief and in the Day of Resurrection and recompense and did work that was pleasing to God, then their reward is established for them with their Lord, and they have no fear regarding what they will face in the Hereafter, nor will they grieve over what they missed of worldly matters. As for after the mission of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, as the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers to all people, God does not accept from anyone a religion other than what he brought, which is Islam.
m-0020	"And remember, O Children of Israel, when We took a firm covenant from you to believe in God and to worship Him alone, and We raised Mount Tur above you and said to you, ""Take the Book which We have given you with diligence and effort and preserve it, or else We will close the mountain upon you, and do not forget the Torah in word and deed, so that you may fear Me and fear My punishment."" Then you disobeyed and rebelled again after taking the covenant and raising the mountain, as is your usual practice. Had it not been for the grace of God upon you and His mercy in repentance and overlooking your sins, you would have become among the losers in this world and the Hereafter. And you have certainly known, O community of Jews, what happened to your ancestors from the people of the town that disobeyed God in what He took from them regarding the glorification of the Sabbath, so they schemed to catch fish on the Sabbath by placing nets and digging ponds, then they caught fish on Sunday as a trick to the forbidden, so when they did that, God transformed them into apes, outcasts. So We made this town a lesson for those in its presence from the towns, so that they may hear its news and what happened to it, and a lesson for those who commit similar sins after it, and We made it a reminder for the righteous so that they may know that they are on the right path. The right to prove it"
m-0021	"And remember, O Children of Israel, the crime of your ancestors and their many stubbornness and arguments with Moses, peace be upon him, when he said to them, “Allah commands you to slaughter a cow.” They said, arrogantly, “Do you make us an object of mockery and contempt?” Moses responded to them by saying, “I seek refuge in Allah from being among the mockers.” They said, “Call upon your Lord to explain to us the characteristics of this cow.” He replied, “Allah tells you that its characteristics are that it is neither old nor young, but rather that it is in between.” So hasten to obey the command of your Lord. They returned to their argument, saying, “Call upon your Lord to explain to us its color.” He said, “He says that it is a yellow cow, a deep yellow that pleases whoever looks at it.” The Children of Israel said to Moses, “Call upon your Lord to explain to us other characteristics other than what was mentioned previously, because there are many cows with these characteristics, so it was unclear to us what to choose. And we, God willing, will be guided to the cow that was commanded to be slaughtered.” Moses said to them, “Allah says that it is a cow that is not tamed for work in plowing the land for agriculture, nor prepared for watering from the irrigator, and free from all defects, and there is nothing in it.” A sign of a color other than the color of its skin. They said, “Now you have come with the true description of the cow.” They were forced to slaughter it after a long evasion. They almost did not do so because of their stubbornness. Thus, they were strict, so God was strict with them.

And remember when you killed a person and disputed about it, each one defending himself against the accusation of murder. And God brought out what you were hiding of killing the slain.

So We said, “Strike the slain man with a part of this slaughtered cow, for God will raise him alive and inform you of his killer.” So they struck him with a part of it, and God brought him back to life and informed of his killer. Thus God will bring the dead to life on the Day of Resurrection and show you, O Children of Israel, His miracles that indicate the perfection of His power, so that you may think with your minds and refrain from disobeying Him."
m-0022	But you did not benefit from that, because after all these miraculous miracles, your hearts hardened and became so hard that no good could penetrate them and they did not soften before the dazzling signs that I showed you until your hearts became like solid stones, rather they are even harder than them, because some stones expand and open until water pours down from them and becomes flowing rivers, and some stones crack and split open so that springs and wells come out of them, and some stones fall from the tops of mountains out of fear of God Almighty and glorification of Him, and God is not unaware of what you do. O Muslims, have you forgotten the actions of the Children of Israel, so your souls desired that the Jews would believe in your religion, and their scholars used to hear the words of God from the Torah, then they would distort it by diverting it to other than its correct meaning after they understood its truth or by distorting its words, and they know that they are distorting the words of the Lord of the Worlds deliberately and falsely.
m-0023	These Jews, when they meet those who believe, say in their tongues, “We believe in your religion and your Messenger who was given glad tidings in the Torah.” But when some of these Jewish hypocrites are alone with one another, they say in denial, “Do you speak to the believers about what God has made clear to you in the Torah about the matter of Muhammad so that they may have an argument against you before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection?” Do you not understand and beware? Do they commit all these crimes and not know that God knows everything they conceal and everything they reveal?
m-0024	Among the Jews are a group who are ignorant of reading and writing and do not know the Torah and what it contains of the attributes of the Prophet of God and His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. They have nothing of that except lies and corrupt assumptions. So destruction and a severe threat to the evil rabbis among the Jews who write the book with their own hands and then say this is from God, while it contradicts what God revealed to His Prophet Moses, may God bless him and grant him peace, in order to take worldly goods in return for this. They will have a devastating punishment because of their writing this falsehood with their own hands, and they will have a devastating punishment because of what they take in return of unlawful money such as bribes and others.
m-0025	The Children of Israel said, “The Fire will not touch us in the Hereafter except for a few days.” Say to them, O Messenger, nullifying their claim, “Do you have a covenant from Allah regarding this?” For Allah does not break His covenant. Rather, you say about Allah what you do not know, by your fabricating lies. So the ruling of Allah is established that whoever commits sins until they lead him to disbelief and his sins take over him from all sides, and this only happens to those who associate partners with Allah. So the polytheists and disbelievers are the ones who will remain in the fire of Hell, a permanent and uninterrupted stay. And the ruling of Allah is established in contrast to this, that those who believed in Allah and His Messengers with a sincere belief and did deeds that were in accordance with the law of Allah that He revealed to His Messengers, these will remain in Paradise in the Hereafter, a permanent and uninterrupted stay.
m-0026	"And remember, O Children of Israel, when We took from you a firm covenant that you would worship Allah alone, with no partner, and that you would be good to parents and relatives and to children whose fathers died before they reached puberty, and to the needy, and that you would speak to people kindly, along with performing the prayer and giving the zakat. Then you turned away and broke the covenant, except for a few of you who adhered to it, and you continued in your turning away.

And remember, O Children of Israel, when We took from you a firm covenant in the Torah, forbidding you to shed one another’s blood and to expel one another from your homes. Then you acknowledged that, and you testified to its validity.

Then you, O these people, kill one another and expel one another from their homes, and each party among you strengthens itself against its brothers through the enemies, out of aggression and hostility, and they come to you as captives in the hands of the enemy. You strive to free them from captivity by paying ransom, although it was forbidden for you to expel them from their homes. How ugly is what you do when you believe in some of the rulings of the Torah and disbelieve in others. The reward of whoever does that among you is nothing but humiliation and disgrace in this world. And on the Day of Resurrection, God will return them to the most terrible punishment in the Fire. And God is not unaware of what you do. Those are the ones who preferred the life of this world over the Hereafter, so the punishment will not be lightened for them, and they will have no helper to protect them from the punishment of God."
m-0027	And We gave Moses the Torah and followed him with messengers from among the Children of Israel. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear miracles and strengthened him with Gabriel, peace be upon him. So, whenever there came to you a messenger with a revelation from Allah that did not agree with your desires, you acted arrogantly towards him. So you denied a party and killed a party. The Children of Israel said to the Prophet of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, “Our hearts are covered, and your word does not reach them.” But the matter is not as they claim. Rather, their hearts are cursed and sealed, and they are expelled from the mercy of Allah because of their denial. So they do not believe except a little faith that does not benefit them.
m-0028	And when the Qur’an came to them from Allah, confirming what they had of the Torah, they denied it and rejected the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Before his mission, they used to seek his help against the polytheists of the Arabs and say, “The coming of the Prophet of the End Times is near, and we will follow him and fight you with him.” But when the Messenger came to them, whose qualities and truthfulness they knew, they disbelieved in him and called him a liar. So the curse of Allah be upon everyone who disbelieves in the Prophet of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and in His Book that Allah revealed to him. How ugly is what the Children of Israel chose for themselves when they replaced disbelief with faith, unjustly and out of envy for Allah’s sending down of His grace the Qur’an upon the Prophet of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. So they returned with the wrath of Allah upon them because of their denial of the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after His wrath upon them because of their distortion of the Torah. And for those who deny the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, there is a punishment that humiliates and disgraces them.
m-0029	And if some Muslims say to the Jews, “Believe in what Allah has revealed of the Qur’an,” they say, “We believe in what Allah has revealed to our prophets,” and they deny what Allah revealed after that, and it is the truth confirming what is with them. If they truly believed in their books, they would have believed in the Qur’an that confirmed them. Say to them, O Muhammad, if you are believers in what Allah has revealed to you, then why did you kill Allah’s prophets before? And Allah’s Prophet Moses came to you with clear miracles indicating his truthfulness, such as the flood, locusts, lice, frogs, and other things that Allah mentioned in the Noble Qur’an. Despite that, you took the calf as a deity after Moses had gone to the appointed time with his Lord, and you were transgressing the limits of Allah. And remember when We took from you a firm covenant to accept what Moses brought you of the Torah, but you broke the covenant. So We raised Mount Tur over your heads and said to you, “Take what We have given you with earnestness and listen and obey, or else We will cause the mountain to fall on you.” But you said, “We hear your word and disobey your command,” because the worship of the calf had become mixed in your hearts due to your persistence in disbelief. Say to them, O Messenger. How ugly is what your faith commands you to do of disbelief and misguidance, if you believe in what God has revealed to you.
m-0030	Say, O Messenger, to the Jews who claim that Paradise is exclusively for them because they claim that they are the friends of Allah to the exclusion of the people and that they are His sons and beloved ones: If this is the case, then call for the death of the liars among you or others if you are truthful in this claim of yours. They will never do that because they know the truthfulness of the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and their lies and fabrications, and because of the disbelief and disobedience they committed that led to their being deprived of Paradise and entering Hell. Allah, the Most High, is All-Knowing of the wrongdoers among His servants and will punish them for that. And you should know, O Messenger, that the Jews are the people who desire a long life, no matter how humiliating and disgraceful this life may be. In fact, their desire for a long life exceeds the desires of the polytheists. A Jew wishes to live a thousand years, and this long life will not distance him from the punishment of Allah if he obtains it. Nothing of their deeds is hidden from Allah, and He will punish them for it with the punishment they deserve.
m-0031	Say, O Messenger, to the Jews when they said, “Gabriel is our enemy from among the angels.” Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - indeed, he has revealed the Qur’an upon your heart by permission of Allah, confirming what preceded it of the Books of Allah and a guide to the truth and a bearer of good tidings for those who believe in it of every good in this world and the Hereafter. Whoever is hostile to Allah and His angels and His messengers from among the angels or the humans, especially the two angels Gabriel and Michael, because the Jews claimed that Gabriel was their enemy and Michael was their guardian, so Allah informed them that whoever is hostile to one of them has been hostile to the other and hostile to Allah as well, for Allah is an enemy to those who deny what was revealed to His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
m-0032	And We have sent down to you, O Messenger, clear and evident verses that indicate that you are a messenger from God, truthfully and truly. And none denies those verses except those who have gone beyond the religion of God. How ugly is the state of the Children of Israel in their breaking of covenants. Every time they made a covenant, a group of them would abandon that covenant and break it. So you see them making a covenant today and breaking it tomorrow. In fact, most of them do not believe in what the Prophet of God and His Messenger, Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, brought. And when Muhammad, the Messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him, came to them with the Qur’an that agreed with what they had of the Torah, a group of them threw away the Book of God and put it behind their backs, as is the case with ignorant people who do not know its truth.
m-0033	The Jews followed what the devils and magicians spoke of during the reign of Solomon, son of David. Solomon did not disbelieve nor did he learn magic, but the devils were the ones who disbelieved in God when they taught people magic to corrupt their religion. Likewise, the Jews followed the magic that was sent down to the two angels, Harut and Marut, in the land of Babylon in Iraq, as a test and trial from God for His servants. The two angels did not teach anyone until they advised him and warned him against learning magic and said to him, “Do not disbelieve by learning magic and obeying the devils.” So people learned from the two angels what they used to create hatred between spouses until they separated. The magicians could not harm anyone with it except by God’s permission and decree. The magicians learn nothing but evil that harms them and does not benefit them. The devils transmitted it to the Jews, so it became widespread among them until they preferred it to the Book of God. The Jews knew that whoever chose magic and abandoned the truth would have no share in goodness in the Hereafter. Evil is what they sold themselves for, magic and disbelief, instead of faith and following the Messenger. If they had knowledge that would produce action based on what they were admonished with. If the Jews had believed and feared God, they would have been certain that God’s reward was better for them than magic and what they acquired through it if they had been. They know the true reward and recompense that comes with faith and piety, if they believe.
m-0034	O you who believe! Do not say to the Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) “Ra’ina” meaning “Ra’ina” means “hear us” and understand us, because the Jews used to say it to the Prophet (peace be upon him), twisting their tongues with it, intending to insult him and accuse him of rashness. Say, O believers, instead of it “Unzurna” meaning “look at us” and “look after us,” and it conveys the same intended meaning. And listen to what is recited to you from the Book of your Lord and understand it. And for the deniers is a painful punishment. The disbelievers among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists do not like that even the slightest good should be sent down to you from your Lord, whether it be a Qur’an or knowledge or victory or good tidings. And God singles out for His mercy whomever He wills of His servants with prophethood and message. And God is the possessor of abundant and generous giving.
m-0035	What We change of a verse or what We have revealed to the hearts and minds, We will bring you something more beneficial than it or something similar to it in terms of obligation and reward. And for every purpose there is wisdom. Did you not know, O Prophet, you and your nation, that Allah is Able and nothing is impossible for Him? Did you not know, O Prophet, you and your nation, that Allah is the Owner who controls the heavens and the earth. He does what He wills and rules as He wills and commands His servants and forbids them as He wills, and upon them is obedience and acceptance. And let him who disobeys know that there is no one besides Allah a guardian who can protect them or a helper who can protect them from the punishment of Allah. Rather, do you want, O people, to ask your Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for things with the intention of stubbornness and obstinacy, as the same was asked of Moses? Know that whoever chooses disbelief and abandons faith has departed from the straight path of Allah and into ignorance and misguidance.
m-0036	Many of the People of the Book wished to return you after your belief to disbelief as you were before, worshipping idols because of the hatred that filled their souls after it became clear to them that the Prophet of God and His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, was truthful in what he brought. So overlook their wrongdoing and mistakes and pardon their ignorance until God brings about His judgment on them by fighting them. And it has come and happened and He will punish them for their evil deeds. Indeed, God is capable of all things, and nothing is beyond His power. O believers, occupy yourself with performing the prayer in the correct manner and giving the obligatory zakat. Know that every good thing you do for yourselves you will find its reward with God in the Hereafter. Indeed, the Most High is All-Seeing of all your deeds and will reward you for them.
m-0037	Both the Jews and Christians claimed that Paradise is exclusive to their sect and no one else will enter it. These are their corrupt delusions. Say to them, O Messenger, bring your evidence for the truth of what you claim if you are truthful in your claim. The matter is not as they claimed, that Paradise is exclusive to one sect and not another. Rather, Paradise will be entered by those who are sincere to God alone, with no partner for Him, and who follow the Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, in all his words and deeds. Whoever does that will have the reward of his work with his Lord in the Hereafter, which is entering Paradise. They will not fear what will come to them in the Hereafter, nor will they grieve over what they have missed of worldly fortunes.
m-0038	The Jews said, “Christians do not follow any of the true religion.” The Christians said the same about the Jews, even though they read the Torah and the Gospel, in which it is obligatory to believe in all the prophets. Likewise, those who do not know among the polytheists of the Arabs and others said something similar to what they said, that is, they said to every person of religion, “You do not follow anything.” So God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding the matter of religion in which they differed, and He will reward each according to his deeds.
m-0039	No one is more unjust than those who prevent the remembrance of Allah in the mosques, by establishing prayer, reciting the Qur’an, and the like. They find it in their destruction by demolishing or closing them, or by preventing the believers from entering them. Those are the wrongdoers. It was not appropriate for them to enter the mosques except in fear and dread of punishment. For them is humiliation and disgrace in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a severe punishment. And to Allah belong the two directions of the sunrise and its setting, and what is between them. He is the Owner of the entire earth. So whichever direction you turn in prayer, by Allah’s command to you, you are seeking His countenance. You have not gone outside of His dominion and obedience. Indeed, Allah is Vast in mercy to His servants, Knowing of their actions, nothing of them is hidden from Him.
m-0040	The Jews, Christians, and polytheists said, “Allah has taken for Himself a son.” Allah, the Exalted, is far removed from this false statement. Rather, all that is in the heavens and the earth is His, and His servants are all subject to Him, subject to His management. Allah, the Most High, is the Creator of the heavens and the earth without a previous example. When He decrees a matter and wants it to be, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is. The ignorant among the People of the Book and others said to the Prophet of Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, out of stubbornness, “Why does not Allah speak to us directly to inform us that you are His Messenger, or should a miracle come to us from Allah to prove your truthfulness?” And similar statements were said by nations before them to their messengers out of stubbornness and obstinacy because of the similarity of the hearts of those who came before and those who came after in disbelief and misguidance. We have made the verses clear to those who believe with absolute certainty, because they are believers in Allah, the Most High, following what He has prescribed for them. We have sent you, O Messenger, with the true religion supported by proofs and miracles, so convey it to the people, while giving good tidings to the believers of the good of this world and the Hereafter, and frightening the obstinate with what awaits them from the punishment of Allah. And after conveying the message, you are not responsible for Whoever disbelieves in you will enter Hell on the Day of Resurrection and will never come out of it.
m-0041	And the Jews and Christians will never be pleased with you, O Messenger, unless you abandon your religion and follow their religion. Tell them that the religion of Islam is the true religion. And if you follow the desires of these people after what has come to you of revelation, you will have with Allah no protector to benefit you or helper to support you. This is directed to the nation in general, even though it is addressed to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Those to whom We gave the Scripture from among the Jews and Christians read it correctly and follow it as it should be followed and believe in what is in it of belief in the Messengers of Allah, including the Seal of them, our Prophet and Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. They do not distort or alter what is in it. These are the ones who believe in the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and in what was revealed to him. As for those who changed some of the Scripture and concealed some of it, these are disbelievers in the Prophet of Allah Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and in what was revealed to him. And whoever disbelieves in him, then those are the people who are most deprived in the sight of Allah.
m-0042	O descendants of Jacob, remember My many blessings upon you and that I preferred you over the people of your time because of the multitude of your prophets and the books that were sent down to them. And fear the terrors of the Day of Judgment when no soul will avail another soul at all, and God will not accept from it a ransom to save it from the punishment, nor will mediation benefit it, nor will anyone help it.
m-0043	"And remember, O Prophet, when Allah tested Abraham with the duties He had prescribed for him, and he performed them and did them in the best manner. Allah said to him, “Indeed, I will make you an example for mankind.” Abraham said, “My Lord, make some of my descendants imams, as a favor from You.” Allah, the Exalted, answered him, “The wrongdoers will not attain leadership in religion.” And remember, O Prophet, when We made the Kaaba a reference for the people, to come to it and then return to their families and then return to it, and a gathering place for them for Hajj and Umrah and Tawaf and prayer, and a security for them, no enemy will attack them therein. And We said, “Take from the standing place of Abraham a place for prayer therein,” and it is the stone on which Abraham stood when he built the Kaaba. And We inspired Abraham and his son Ishmael, “Purify My House from every uncleanness and filth for those who worship therein by circumambulating the Kaaba or secluding themselves in the mosque and praying therein.” And remember, O Prophet, when Abraham said, supplicating, “My Lord, make Mecca a city safe from fear and provide its people with various kinds of fruits.” And He singled out with this provision those of them who believed in Allah and the Last Day. Allah said, “And whoever disbelieves among them - then I will provide for him in this world and grant him a brief enjoyment, then I will force him to enter Paradise.” Forced to the torment of the Fire, and what an evil destination and abode is this fate.

And remember, O Prophet, when Abraham and Ishmael raised the foundations of the Kaaba, and they were calling upon God in humility, “Our Lord, accept from us our good deeds and our supplication. Indeed, You are the Hearer of the words of Your servants, the Knower of their conditions.”

Our Lord, make us steadfast in Islam, obedient to Your rulings, and make from our descendants a nation obedient to You in faith, and make us see the signs of our worship of You, and overlook our sins. Indeed, You are the One who is abundant in repentance and mercy to Your servants.

Our Lord, and send among this nation a Messenger from the descendants of Ishmael, reciting to them Your verses and teaching them the Qur’an and the Sunnah and purifying them from polytheism and bad morals. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, from whom nothing is impossible, the Wise, who places things in their proper places."
m-0044	No one turns away from the religion of Abraham, which is Islam, except an ignorant fool. And We chose Abraham in this world as a prophet and messenger, and indeed, in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous, who will have the highest ranks. The reason for this choice was his hastening to Islam without hesitation when his Lord said to him, “Sacrifice yourself for God, submitting to Him.” Abraham responded and said, “I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds, sincerely, in monotheism, in love, and in repentance.” Abraham and Jacob urged their sons to remain steadfast in Islam, saying, “O our sons, God has chosen for you this religion, which is the religion of Islam that Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, brought. Do not depart from it during the days of your lives, and let no death come to you except while you are upon it.” Were you Jews present when death came to Jacob when he gathered his sons and asked them, “What will you worship after my death?” They said, “We will worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac, one God. And we are obedient and submissive to Him.” That is a nation from your ancestors. Their deeds have passed, and your deeds will pass. You will not be asked about their deeds, and they will not be asked about your deeds. Each will be rewarded for what he did. No one will be held accountable for the sin of another, and nothing will benefit anyone except his faith. And his piety
m-0045	"The Jews said to the nation of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “Enter the religion of Judaism and you will find guidance.” The Christians said the same to them. Say to them, O Messenger, “Rather, guidance is that we all follow the religion of Abraham, who inclined from every false religion to the religion of truth, and he was not among those who associated others with God Almighty.” Say, O believers, to these Jews and Christians, “We believe in God, the One, Who is truly worshipped, and in what was revealed to us from the Qur’an that God revealed to His Prophet and Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and in what was revealed from the scriptures to Abraham and his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, and to Jacob and the Tribes, who are the prophets from the descendants of Jacob, who were among the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel, and in what was given to Moses from the Torah and Jesus from the Gospel, and in what was given to all the prophets from the revelation of their Lord. We do not differentiate between any of them in faith, and we are submissive to God in obedience and worship.” If the disbelievers from the Jews and Christians and others believe in what you believe in from what the Messenger brought, then they have been guided to the truth, and if they turn away, then they are only in severe disagreement. So God will suffice you, O Messenger, against their evil and grant you victory over them, and He is the All-Hearing.” For your sayings, the All-Knowing of your conditions
Adhere to the religion of God upon which He created you, for there is nothing better than the nature of God upon which He created people, so adhere to it and say, “We are submissive and obedient to our Lord in following the religion of Abraham.”"
m-0046	Say, O Messenger, to the People of the Book: Do you argue with us about the Oneness of God and sincerity to Him, while He is the Lord of all the worlds. He is not specific to a people over a people. We have our deeds and you have your deeds. We are sincere in our worship and obedience to God. We do not associate anything with Him nor do we worship anyone other than Him? Rather, do you say, arguing about God, that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, who are the prophets who were among the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel from the descendants of Jacob, were of the religion of the Jews or Christians? This is a lie, for they were sent and died before the Torah and the Gospel were revealed. Say to them, O Messenger: Are you more knowledgeable about their religion than God Almighty? He has informed us in the Qur’an that they were monotheists, Muslims. No one is more unjust than you when you conceal a testimony that you have from God Almighty and claim otherwise, fabricating against God. God is not unaware of any of your deeds. Rather, He is recording them and rewarding you for them. That is a nation from your ancestors. Their deeds have passed away, and you will have your deeds. You will not be asked about their deeds, and they will not be asked about your deeds. The verse cuts off the attachment to the created beings and not to be deceived. By belonging to them, and that the point is to believe in God and worship Him alone and follow His messengers, and that whoever disbelieves in one of their messengers has disbelieved in all the other messengers.
m-0047	The ignorant and weak-minded Jews and their likes will say in mockery and objection: What turned these Muslims away from the direction of the Qiblah towards which they used to pray at the beginning of Islam, which is Jerusalem? Tell them, O Messenger, that the East and the West and what is between them belong to God. No direction is outside His dominion. He guides whomever He wills of His servants to the straight path of guidance. This is a notification that the entire affair is for God in obeying His commands. Wherever He directs us, we will turn. And just as We have guided you, O Muslims, to the correct path in religion, We have made you a nation of the best and most just, so that you may bear witness over the nations in the Hereafter that their messengers conveyed to them the messages of their Lord. And the Messenger will also be a witness over you in the Hereafter that he conveyed to you the message of his Lord. And We did not make the Qiblah of Jerusalem, which you were facing, then We turned you away from it to the Kaaba in Mecca, except to show what We knew from eternity, knowledge to which reward and punishment are related, so that We may distinguish who follows you and obeys you and faces with you wherever you face, and who is weak in faith and turns away from his religion due to his doubt and hypocrisy. And this state, which is the Muslim’s turning in his prayer from facing Jerusalem to… Facing the Kaaba is a heavy burden except for those whom He has guided and bestowed upon them faith and piety. And Allah would not let your faith in Him and your following of His Messenger go to waste, and would not invalidate your prayer toward the previous Qiblah. Indeed, He is Most Kind and Most Merciful to the people. We have seen your face, O Messenger, turning toward the sky time after time, awaiting the revelation to you regarding the Qiblah. So We will turn you away from the Holy House to a Qiblah that you love and are pleased with, which is the direction of the Sacred Mosque in Mecca. So turn your face toward it. And wherever you are, O Muslims, and you want to pray, turn toward the Sacred Mosque. And those to whom Allah has given knowledge of the Book, from among the Jews and Christians, know that your turning toward the Kaaba is the truth established in their books. And Allah is not unaware of what these objecting doubters do, and He will punish them for that. And if you came, O Messenger, to those who were given the Torah and the Gospel, with every argument and proof that your facing toward the Kaaba in prayer is the truth from Allah, they would not follow your Qiblah out of stubbornness and arrogance, and you will not follow their Qiblah again, nor will some of them follow the Qiblah of others. And if You followed their desires regarding the direction of prayer and other matters after the knowledge that you are on the truth and they are on falsehood came to you. Indeed, you would then be among the wrongdoers to themselves. This is an address to the entire nation and it is a threat and warning to those who follow the desires of those who oppose the Sharia of Islam.
m-0048	"Those to whom We gave the Torah and the Gospel from the rabbis of the Jews and the scholars of the Christians know that Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, is the Messenger of God with his descriptions mentioned in their books, just as they know their own sons. And a party of them conceal the truth while they know its truthfulness and the confirmation of its descriptions.

What has been revealed to you, O Prophet, is the truth from your Lord, so do not be among those who doubt it. And although this is addressed to the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, it is directed to the nation.

And every nation has a qiblah toward which each one of them turns in his prayer, so hasten, O believers, to compete in doing the righteous deeds that God has prescribed for you in the religion of Islam. And God will gather you all on the Day of Resurrection from whatever place you are in. Indeed, God is over all things competent.

And from whatever place you go out, O Prophet, traveling and wanting to pray, turn your face toward the Sacred Mosque. And your turning toward it is the established truth from your Lord. And God is not unaware of what you do, and He will reward you for that.

And from whatever place you go out, O Prophet, turn toward the Sacred Mosque. And wherever you are, O Muslims, in any region of the earth, turn your faces toward the Sacred Mosque. So that the people who oppose you will not have any argument against you by quarreling and arguing after this approach to Him, except for the people of injustice and stubbornness among them, for they will continue their argument, so do not fear them, but fear Me by obeying My commands and avoiding My prohibitions, and so that I may complete My favor upon you by choosing the most perfect laws for you, and perhaps you will be guided to the truth and the right."
m-0049	Just as We have blessed you with facing the Kaaba, We have sent among you a Messenger from among you who recites to you the verses that clarify the truth from falsehood and purifies you from the filth of polytheism and bad morals and teaches you the Book and the Sunnah and the rulings of the Shariah and teaches you from the news of the prophets and the stories of the previous nations what you did not know. The Almighty commanded the believers to remember Him and promised for it the best reward, which is praise in the highest assembly for those who remember Him. And single me out, O believers, with thanks in word and deed, and do not deny My favors upon you. O believers, seek help from Allah in all your affairs by being patient in the face of misfortunes and calamities, abandoning sins and transgressions, and being patient in performing acts of obedience and devotion, and praying, which reassures the soul and prevents indecency and wrongdoing. Indeed, Allah is with the patient, with His help, success, and guidance. In the verse, there is proof of Allah’s special companionship with the believers, which necessitates what was mentioned previously. As for the general companionship that necessitates knowledge and encompassment, it is for all creation.
m-0050	And do not say, O believers, about those who are killed fighting in the cause of Allah, that they are dead. Rather, they are alive with a life of their own in their graves, the nature of which is known only to Allah, the Most High, but you do not perceive it. And in this is evidence of the bliss of the grave. And We will surely test you with a little fear and hunger, and with a loss of wealth due to difficulty in obtaining it or its loss, and with lives due to death or martyrdom in the cause of Allah, and with a loss of the fruits of palm trees, grapes, and grains due to a small yield or their spoilage. And give good tidings, O Prophet, to those who are patient with this and similar matters, with what will make them happy and gladden them of a good outcome in this world and the Hereafter. Among the characteristics of these patient people is that when something they dislike befalls them, they say, “Indeed, we are slaves owned by Allah, governed by His command and His disposition. He does with us what He wills, and indeed, to Him we will return.” With death, then with resurrection for reckoning and reward. Those are the patient ones, for them is praise from their Lord and great mercy from Him, glory be to Him. And those are the ones who are guided to the right path.
m-0051	Al-Safa and Al-Marwah, which are two small mountains near the Kaaba on the eastern side, are among the apparent landmarks of the religion of God, which command His servants to walk between them. Whoever intends to go to the Kaaba as a pilgrim or a performer of Umrah, there is no sin upon him and no blame upon him for walking between them, rather it is obligatory upon him. And whoever does acts of obedience voluntarily from himself, sincerely for God Almighty, then God Almighty is grateful and rewards for little with much. He is aware of the deeds of His servants, so He does not diminish them nor does He deprive anyone of the weight of an atom.
m-0052	Those who conceal what We have revealed of the clear signs indicating the prophethood of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and what he brought - and they are the rabbis of the Jews and the scholars of the Christians and others who conceal what God has revealed after We made it clear to the people in the Torah and the Gospel - those - God will expel them from His mercy and will curse all of creation upon them. Except for those who return, seeking God's forgiveness for their sins, and correct what they have corrupted, and make clear what they have concealed. For those, I will accept their repentance and reward them with forgiveness. And I am the Accepter of Repentance to whoever of My servants repents, the Most Merciful to them, since I have guided them to repentance and accepted it from them. Indeed, those who denied the faith and concealed the truth and persisted in that until they died - upon them is the curse of God and the angels and all of mankind by expulsion from His mercy. They will remain in the curse and the Fire. Their punishment will not be lightened, nor will they be given respite by making an excuse.
m-0053	And your God, O people, is one God, unique in His essence, names, attributes, actions, and the servitude of His creation to Him. There is no true deity except Him, the Most Gracious, characterized by mercy in His essence and actions to all creation, the Most Merciful to the believers. In the creation of the heavens with their height and vastness, and the earth with its mountains, plains, and seas, and in the difference between night and day in length and shortness, darkness and light, and their succession, each succeeding the other, and in the ships sailing in the seas carrying what benefits people, and in what God sent down from the sky of rainwater, thereby reviving the earth, so that it became green and cheerful after it had been dry and without vegetation, and in what God spread in it of every creeping thing on the face of the earth, and in what He bestowed upon you of turning the winds and directing them, and the clouds moving between the sky and the earth, in all the previous proofs there are signs of the oneness of God and the greatness of His blessings for a people who understand the places of the arguments and comprehend His proofs, glory be to Him, of His oneness and His alone being deserving of worship.
m-0054	Despite these conclusive proofs, a group of people take idols, statues, and guardians besides Allah, making them equal to Allah the Most High, and giving them love, reverence, and obedience that is only befitting of Allah alone. The believers have greater love for Allah than the love of these disbelievers for Allah and their gods, because the believers have sincerely devoted all their love to Allah, while those have associated others with Him in love. If only those who wronged themselves by associating others with Allah in this worldly life knew, when they witness the punishment of the Hereafter, that Allah is the One with all power and that Allah is severe in punishment, they would not have taken gods besides Allah to worship instead of Him and to draw near to Him through them. When they witness the punishment of the Hereafter, the leaders who are followed disavow those who followed them in polytheism, and all the ties that they had in this world, such as kinship, following, religion, and other things, are severed between them. The followers say, “If only we could return to this world so that we could declare our innocence from these leaders, just as they declared their innocence from us, and just as Allah showed them the severity of His punishment on the Day of Resurrection, He will show them their false deeds as regrets for them, and they will never be out of the Fire.”
m-0055	O people, eat from the provision of Allah which He has permitted to you on earth, and it is pure and not impure, beneficial and not harmful. And do not follow the ways of Satan in making lawful and unlawful, innovations and sins. Indeed, he is an enemy to you with clear enmity. Satan only commands you to commit every ugly sin that will upset you, and every extremely ugly disobedience, and to invent lies about Allah by making lawful and other things unlawful without knowledge.
m-0056	And when the believers say, advising the people of misguidance, “Follow what Allah has revealed of the Qur’an and the guidance,” they insist on imitating their polytheist ancestors, saying, “We do not follow your religion, but we follow what we found our fathers doing.” Would they follow their fathers even though they did not understand anything about Allah nor attain right judgment? The description of those who disbelieved and their caller to guidance and faith is like the description of a shepherd who shouts at the animals and urges them on, and they do not understand the meanings of his words, but only hear the call and the sound of the voice. These disbelievers are deaf, they have blocked their ears from the truth, they have muted their tongues from uttering it, they are blind, their eyes do not see its dazzling proofs, so they do not use their minds in what benefits them.
m-0057	O you who believe! Eat of the lawful and delicious foods which We have provided for you, and do not be like the disbelievers who forbid good things and permit evil things. And be grateful to Allah for His great favors upon you with your hearts, tongues, and limbs, if you are truly submissive to His command, hearing and obeying Him, worshipping Him alone, with no partner or associate. Allah has only forbidden to you that which harms you, such as dead animals that were not slaughtered in a lawful manner, spilled blood, the flesh of swine, and the sacrifices that were slaughtered for other than Allah. And from Allah’s favor and facilitation upon you is that He has permitted you to eat these forbidden foods when necessary. So whoever is forced by necessity to eat something from them, not being unjust in eating more than he needs, nor transgressing the limits of Allah in what is permitted to him, then there is no sin upon him in that. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful towards them.
m-0058	Those who conceal what Allah has revealed in His Books of the description of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and other truths, and are keen to take a small reward from the worldly life in exchange for this concealment, they will not eat in return for concealing the truth except the fire of Hell that is raging in their bellies, and Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection because of His anger and wrath upon them, nor will He purify them from the filth of their sins and disbelief, and they will have a painful punishment. Those who are described by these qualities have exchanged misguidance for guidance and the punishment of Allah for His forgiveness. How great is their audacity towards the Fire by doing the deeds of the people of the Fire. Allah is amazed by their daring to do that, so be amazed, O people, at their audacity and their patience towards the Fire and their remaining in it. This is in the form of belittling them and making light of their matter. This is the punishment that they deserved because Allah the Most High revealed His Books to His Messengers containing the clear truth, but they disbelieved in it. And those who differed over the Book, believing in some of it and disbelieving in some of it, are in dispute and separation far from guidance and correctness.
m-0059	Goodness in the sight of Allah the Almighty is not in facing the east or the west in prayer if it is not by Allah’s command and law. Rather, all goodness is the faith of one who believes in Allah and believes in Him as the only deity to be worshipped, without partner, and believes in the Day of Resurrection and recompense, in all the angels, in all the revealed books, and in all the prophets without discrimination, and gives money voluntarily, despite his intense love for relatives, needy orphans whose fathers died before they reached puberty, the poor who are exhausted by poverty, needy travelers who are far from their families and their wealth, and those who ask because of their intense need, and spends in freeing slaves and captives, and establishes prayer, and pays the obligatory zakat, and those who fulfill their covenants, and those who are patient in their poverty and sickness and in the intensity of battle. Those who are characterized by these qualities are those who are sincere in their faith, and those are those who fear Allah’s punishment and avoid His disobedience.
m-0060	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, Allah has made it obligatory upon you to exact retribution from the deliberate killer by killing him on the condition of equality and similarity. A free man shall be killed in return for his like, a slave in return for his like, and a female in return for her like. But if the guardian of the murdered person forgives him by pardoning him from retaliation and is satisfied with taking the blood money, which is a specific amount of money that the perpetrator pays in exchange for his pardon, then both parties should adhere to good conduct. The guardian should demand the blood money without violence, and the murderer should pay him his right with kindness, without delay or reduction. This pardon, along with taking the blood money, is a relief from your Lord and a mercy to you, because it is easy and beneficial. Whoever kills the murderer after forgiving him and taking the blood money, will have a painful punishment by killing him in retaliation in this world or by the Fire in the Hereafter. And in the legislation of retaliation and its implementation, you have a safe life, O people of sound minds, hoping for fear of Allah and awe of Him by always obeying Him.
m-0061	Allah has enjoined upon you, if any of you is present with signs of death and its preliminaries, if he leaves wealth, to bequeath a portion of his wealth to his parents and relatives, while observing justice. He should not leave out the poor and bequeath to the rich, and not exceed a third. This is an established right that is followed by the pious who fear Allah. This was before the revelation of the verses of inheritance in which Allah specified the share of each heir. Whoever changes the will of the deceased after hearing it from him before his death, then the sin is upon the one who changes and alters it. Indeed, Allah is Hearing of your wills and your words, Knowing what your hearts conceal of inclination toward truth and justice or injustice and oppression. And He will reward you for that. Whoever knows of a testator’s deviation from the truth in his will, whether by mistake or intentionally, and advises the testator at the time of the will with what is most just, but if that does not happen to him, then he reconciles between the parties by changing the will to conform to the Shari’ah, then there is no sin upon him for this reconciliation. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful towards them.
m-0062	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, Allah has enjoined upon you fasting as He enjoined upon the nations before you that you may fear your Lord and put between yourselves and sins a shield by obeying Him and worshipping Him alone. Allah has enjoined upon you fasting a certain number of days, which are the days of the month of Ramadan. So whoever among you is ill and finds fasting difficult, or is traveling, he may break his fast and must fast a number of other days equal to the days he broke his fast. And upon those who are burdened with fasting and it is unbearable hardship for them, such as the elderly and the sick who are not expected to recover, is a ransom for each day he breaks his fast, which is feeding a poor person. Whoever increases the amount of the ransom voluntarily, it is better for him. And your fasting is better for you, despite bearing the hardship, than giving the ransom, if you only knew the great virtue of fasting with Allah the Most High. The month of Ramadan in which Allah began the revelation of the Qur’an on the Night of Decree, as guidance for people to the truth. In it are the clearest proofs of Allah’s guidance and the difference between truth and falsehood. So whoever among you is present during the month and is healthy and resident, let him fast during the day, and the sick and the traveler are permitted to break their fast, then they must make up the number of those days. Allah the Most High wants for you Ease and simplicity in His laws, and He does not want for you hardship and difficulty, and to complete the number of fasting for a month, and to conclude the fast by glorifying Allah on Eid al-Fitr, and to magnify Him for His guidance to you, and to thank Him for the guidance, success, and ease He has bestowed upon you. And when My servants ask you, O Prophet, about Me, say to them, “Indeed, I am near to them. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me.” So let them obey Me in what I have commanded them and forbidden them, and believe in Me that they may be guided to the interests of their religion and their worldly life. In this verse, there is news from Him, glory be to Him, about His closeness to His servants, a closeness befitting His Majesty.
m-0063	Allah has permitted you to have intercourse with your wives during the nights of the month of Ramadan. They are a cover and protection for you, and you are a cover and protection for them. Allah knows that you were betraying yourselves by disobeying what Allah has forbidden you, which is having intercourse with your wives after the evening meal during the nights of fasting. This was at the beginning of Islam, so Allah accepted your repentance and made things easy for you. So now have intercourse with them and seek what Allah has decreed for you of children. Eat and drink until the light of morning becomes distinct from the darkness of night with the appearance of the true dawn. Then complete the fast by abstaining from things that break the fast until night falls with sunset. Do not have intercourse with your wives or engage in anything that leads to intercourse with them if you are in seclusion in the mosques, because this spoils the seclusion, which is staying in the mosque for a known period with the intention of drawing closer to Allah the Most High. These rulings that Allah has prescribed for you are His boundaries that separate what is permissible from what is forbidden, so do not approach them so that you do not fall into what is forbidden. With such clear explanation, Allah explains His signs and rulings to the people so that they may fear Him and be in awe of Him.
m-0064	And do not consume one another's wealth through false means, such as false oaths, usurpation, theft, bribery, usury, and the like. And do not present false arguments to the rulers in order to consume, through dispute, the wealth of a group of people unjustly, while you know that this is forbidden to you.
m-0065	Your companions ask you, O Prophet, about the new moons and the changing conditions of them. Tell them that God has made the new moons signs by which people know the times of their specific acts of worship, such as fasting, Hajj, and their transactions. Good is not what you were accustomed to in the pre-Islamic period and the beginning of Islam, of entering houses from the back when you are in ihram for Hajj or Umrah, thinking that this is a way of drawing closer to God. Rather, good is the action of one who fears God and avoids sins. Enter houses through their doors when you are in ihram for Hajj or Umrah, and fear God Almighty in all your affairs so that you may win all that you love of the good of this world and the hereafter.
m-0066	And fight, O believers, to support the religion of Allah against those who fight you, and do not commit the forbidden acts of mutilation, plunder, and killing those who are not permissible to kill, such as women, children, the elderly, and those who are in a similar position. Indeed, Allah does not like those who transgress His limits and consider permissible what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. And kill those who fight you from among the polytheists wherever you find them, and expel them from the place from which they have expelled you, which is Mecca. And the fitnah, which is disbelief, polytheism, and turning away from Islam, is more severe than killing them. And do not initiate fighting with them at the Sacred Mosque, out of respect for its sanctity, until they initiate fighting with you there. But if they fight you in the Sacred Mosque, then kill them there. Such a deterrent punishment is the punishment of the disbelievers. But if they abandon what they are doing of disbelief and fighting you at the Sacred Mosque and enter into faith, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful to them. And continue, O believers, in fighting the aggressive polytheists until there is no temptation for the Muslims from their religion, nor polytheism with Allah, and the religion remains purely for Allah alone, with no one else worshipped with Him. Stop disbelief and fighting, so stop them, for the punishment is only for those who persist in their disbelief and aggression. Your fighting, O believers, against the polytheists in the month in which Allah has forbidden fighting is a recompense for their fighting you in the sacred month. And whoever transgresses what Allah has forbidden in terms of place and time will be punished with the same action and of the same kind as his action. So whoever transgresses against you in fighting or otherwise, inflict on him a punishment similar to his crime, and there is no blame on you for that because they are the ones who initiated the aggression. And fear Allah, so do not exceed the similarity in punishment, and know that Allah is with those who fear Him and obey Him by performing His obligations and avoiding His prohibitions.
m-0067	And continue, O believers, to spend money to support the religion of God Almighty and to strive in His cause, and do not expose yourselves to destruction by abandoning striving in the cause of God and not spending in it, and do good in spending and obedience, and make all your work purely for the sake of God Almighty, for God loves the people of sincerity and benevolence.
m-0068	And perform Hajj and Umrah in full and purely for the sake of Allah the Most High. If you are prevented from completing them after entering ihram for them by an obstacle such as an enemy or illness, then it is obligatory upon you to slaughter whatever is easy for you of camels, cows or sheep as a way of drawing closer to Allah the Most High so that you may exit your ihram by shaving or shortening your hair. And do not shave your heads if you are prevented until the prevented person slaughters his sacrificial animal in the place where he is prevented and then exits his ihram as the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, slaughtered at Hudaybiyyah and then shaved his head. And the one who is not prevented does not slaughter the sacrificial animal except in the sanctuary which is his place on the day of Eid, the tenth day and the days after it of Tashreeq. So whoever among you is sick or has an injury to his head that requires shaving while he is in ihram, he should shave his head and he must pay a ransom by fasting for three days or giving charity to six poor people, each poor person half a saa of food, or slaughtering a sheep for the poor of the sanctuary. So if you are safe and healthy, then whoever enjoys Umrah to Hajj by making permissible what was forbidden to him due to ihram after completing his Umrah, then he must slaughter whatever is easy of the sacrificial animal. But whoever does not find any A sacrificial animal that he slaughters must fast three days during the months of Hajj and seven days after you have completed the rituals of Hajj and returned to your families. That is ten days in total, and it is obligatory to fast. That is the sacrificial animal and the fasting that results from it for those whose families are not residents of the Sacred Land. Fear Allah the Almighty and maintain compliance with His commands and avoid His prohibitions. Know that Allah is severe in punishment for those who disobey His commands and commit what He has forbidden. The time of Hajj is the well-known months, which are Shawwal, Dhul-Qa'dah, and ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Whoever makes Hajj obligatory upon himself during these months by entering ihram, sexual intercourse and its verbal and physical preliminaries are forbidden to him. It is forbidden to disobey Allah the Almighty by committing sins and arguing during Hajj that leads to anger and hatred. Whatever good you do, Allah knows, and He will reward each one according to his deeds. Take for yourselves provisions of food and drink for the journey of Hajj and provisions of righteous deeds for the Hereafter. Indeed, the best provision is fear of Allah. Fear Me, O people of sound minds. There is no blame upon you for seeking provision from your Lord through profit from trade during the days of Hajj. If you pay After sunset, returning from Arafat, which is the place where pilgrims stand on the ninth day of Dhul-Hijjah, remember Allah by glorifying Him, uttering the Talbiyah, and supplicating at the sacred monument of Muzdalifah. Remember Allah in the correct manner to which He has guided you. Before this guidance, you were in error, not knowing the truth. Let your departure from Arafat, from which Ibrahim (peace be upon him) poured forth, be in opposition to those who did not stand there from the people of ignorance. Ask Allah to forgive you your sins. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving to His servants who seek forgiveness and repent. Merciful to them. When you have completed your worship and finished the Hajj rituals, then increase your remembrance of Allah and praise Him, just as you remember the glories of your fathers, and greater than that. Some people are concerned only with this world, so they supplicate, saying, “Our Lord, give us in this world health, wealth, and children.” These people have no share or portion in the Hereafter, because they are averse to it and their concern is limited to this world. Some people are believers who say in their supplication, “Our Lord, give us in this world health, provision, beneficial knowledge, righteous deeds, and other matters of religion and this world, and in the Hereafter, Paradise.” And avert from us the torment of the Fire. This supplication is one of the most comprehensive supplications, and for this reason it was the most frequently supplicated by the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, as proven in the two Sahihs. Those who supplicate with this supplication will have a great reward because of the righteous deeds they have earned. God is swift in reckoning, measuring the deeds of His servants and rewarding them for them. And remember God, glorifying and magnifying Him, during the few days, which are the days of Tashreeq, the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth of the month of Dhul-Hijjah. So whoever wants to hurry and leaves Mina before sunset on the twelfth day after throwing the pebbles, there is no sin upon him. And whoever delays by spending the night in Mina until he throws the pebbles on the thirteenth day, there is no sin upon him for whoever fears God in his Hajj. Delaying is better because it provides provisions for worship and follows the actions of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace. Fear God, O Muslims, and be mindful of Him in all your deeds, and know that you will be gathered to Him alone after your death for reckoning and recompense.
m-0069	"And some hypocrites, O Messenger, please you with their eloquent speech, by which they seek a share of the worldly fortunes, not the Hereafter, and they swear, citing Allah, that in their heart there is love for Islam. This is the height of audacity towards Allah, and they are extremely hostile and hostile towards Islam and the Muslims.

And if he leaves you, O Messenger, he will be serious and active in the land to corrupt it, destroy people’s crops, and kill their livestock, and Allah does not love corruption.

And if that corrupt hypocrite is advised and told to fear Allah and beware of His punishment and desist from corruption on earth, he will not accept the advice, but rather his arrogance and the fanaticism of ignorance will lead him to commit more sins. Hell is sufficient for him, and it is sufficient punishment for him, and what an evil bed it is.

And some people sell themselves in order to gain Allah’s pleasure by striving in His cause and adhering to His obedience, and Allah is Kind to His servants, and He has great mercy on His believing servants in their immediate and future lives, so He will reward them with the best reward."
m-0070	O you who believe in Allah as Lord, and in Muhammad as Prophet and Messenger, and in Islam as religion, enter into all the laws of Islam, acting according to all its rulings, and do not leave any of them, and do not follow the ways of Satan in what he calls you to of sins, for he is an enemy to you, manifest enmity, so beware of him. If you deviate from the path of truth after the clear proofs have come to you from the Qur’an and Sunnah, then know that Allah is Mighty in His Kingdom, nothing escapes Him, Wise in His commands and prohibitions, and He places everything in its appropriate place. What these stubborn disbelievers await after the clear proofs are established is for Allah, the Almighty, to come to them in the manner befitting Him, glory be to Him, in the shades of clouds on the Day of Resurrection to judge between them with just judgment, and for the angels to come, and then Allah, the Almighty, will pass judgment on them, and to Him alone will all the affairs of creation return.
m-0071	Ask, O Messenger, the Children of Israel who are stubborn with you, how many clear signs We gave them in their books guiding them to the truth, but they disbelieved in all of them, turned away from them, and distorted them from their places. And whoever changes the favor of Allah, which is His religion, and disbelieves in it after knowing it and the proof has been established against him by it, then indeed, Allah is severe in punishment for him. Good for those who denied the Oneness of Allah is the life of this world and what is in it of desires and pleasures, and they mock the believers. And these are the ones who fear their Lord above all the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will admit them to the highest levels of Paradise and will send the disbelievers down to the lowest levels of Hell. And Allah provides for whomever He wills of His creation without account.
m-0072	People were one group, agreed upon in their belief in God, then they differed in their religion. So God sent the prophets as callers to the religion of God, giving good tidings to those who obeyed God of Paradise and warning those who disbelieved in Him and disobeyed Him of the Fire. He sent down with them the heavenly books with the truth that they contained, so that they might judge between people by what they differed in. No one differed in the matter of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and his book out of injustice and envy except those to whom God gave the Torah and who knew what was in it of arguments and rulings. So God guided the believers by His grace to distinguish truth from falsehood and to know what they differed in. And God guides whomever He wills of His servants to a straight path. But did you, O believers, think that you would enter Paradise while you have not been afflicted with a trial like that which afflicted the believers who passed before you of poverty, diseases, fear, and terror, and you were shaken with various kinds of fears until their Messenger and the believers with him said, in order to hasten victory from God Almighty, “When is the victory of God?” Unquestionably, the victory of God is near to the believers.
m-0073	Your companions ask you, O Prophet, what they should spend from their wealth to draw closer to God Almighty, and on whom they should spend. Say to them, “Spend whatever good is easy for you from the types of lawful and good wealth, and devote your spending to parents, and your closest relatives, and your kin, and orphans, and the poor, and the needy traveler who is far from his family and his wealth. And whatever you do of good - indeed, God Almighty is Knowing of it.”
m-0074	Allah has enjoined upon you, O believers, fighting the infidels. Fighting is naturally disliked by you because of its hardship and many dangers. You may dislike something while it is in reality good for you, and you may like something because of its comfort or immediate pleasure while it is bad for you. Allah knows what is good for you, and you do not know that. So hasten to fight in His cause. The polytheists ask you, O Messenger, about the sacred month. Is fighting permissible in it? Tell them that fighting in the sacred month is grave in the sight of Allah. Making it permissible and shedding blood in it, and preventing people from entering Islam through torture and intimidation, and your denial of Allah, His Messenger, and His religion, and preventing Muslims from entering the Sacred Mosque, and expelling the Prophet and the Muhajireen from it, although they are his family and his friends, that is a greater sin and a greater crime in the sight of Allah than fighting in the sacred month. The polytheism that you are in is greater and more severe than killing in the sacred month. These infidels have not been deterred from their crimes, but they continue to do so and will continue to fight you until they turn you back from Islam to disbelief if they are able to achieve that. And whoever among you, O Muslims, obeys them and apostatizes from his religion. So he died in disbelief, his deeds in this world and the Hereafter were lost, and he became one of those who were bound to the fire of Hell, never to emerge from it. Indeed, those who believed in God and His Messenger and acted according to His law, and those who left their homes and fought in the cause of God - those are the ones who hope for the grace and reward of God. And God is Forgiving of the sins of His believing servants, Merciful to them with an extensive mercy.
m-0075	Muslims ask you, O Prophet, about the ruling on drinking, selling, and buying alcohol. Alcohol is every intoxicant that clouds and obscures the mind, whether it is a drink or food. They ask you about the ruling on gambling, which is taking or giving money by gambling, which is the competition in which there is compensation from both parties. Tell them that there is much harm and corruption in religion, the world, minds, and money. There are benefits for people in terms of earning money and other things, but their sin is greater than their benefit, as they prevent people from remembering Allah and from praying, and they cause enmity and hatred between people and waste money. This was a prelude to their prohibition. They ask you about the amount they spend from their money as donations and charity. Tell them, “Spend the amount that exceeds your need.” Like this clear statement, Allah makes clear to you the verses and rulings of the Shariah so that you may reflect on what will benefit you in this world and the Hereafter. They ask you, O Prophet, about orphans, how they should deal with them in their livelihood and money. Tell them, “Your reform of them is best, so always do what is most beneficial for them.” And if you mix with them in all matters of livelihood, they are your brothers in religion, and brotherhood is upon you. To look after the interests of his brother. God knows who wastes the money of orphans and who is keen to reform it. If God had willed, He would have made it difficult for you by prohibiting mixing. God is Almighty in His kingdom and Wise in His creation, management, and legislation.

To look after the interests of his brother, and God knows the one who wastes the wealth of orphans from the one who is keen to reform them. If God had willed, He would have made it difficult for you by forbidding mixing. Indeed, God is Mighty in His Kingdom, Wise in His creation, management, and legislation. And do not marry, O Muslims, polytheistic idol-worshipping women until they enter Islam. And know that a woman who is owned, has no wealth or lineage, and believes in God, is better than a polytheist woman, even if a free polytheist woman pleases you. And do not marry your believing women to slave girls or free women of polytheists until they believe in God and His Messenger. And know that a believing slave, despite his poverty, is better than a polytheist, even if the polytheist pleases you. Those who are characterized by polytheism, men and women, call everyone who associates with them to that which leads him to the Fire. And God, the Exalted, calls His servants to His true religion, which leads them to Paradise and the forgiveness of their sins, by His permission. And He explains His verses and His rulings to the people so that they may remember and take heed.
m-0077	They ask you about menstruation, which is the blood that flows from the wombs of women naturally at specific times. Say to them, O Prophet, it is a disgusting harm that harms whoever comes near it, so avoid intercourse with women during menstruation until the blood stops. When the blood stops and they have washed, then have intercourse with them in the place that Allah has made lawful for you, which is the front, not the back. Indeed, Allah loves His servants who seek forgiveness and repent frequently, and He loves His servants who purify themselves and who stay away from indecencies and filth. Your women are a place of sowing for you. You place the sperm in their wombs, and children emerge from it by the will of Allah, so have intercourse with them in the place of intercourse only, which is the front, in any way you wish, and present for yourselves righteous deeds by observing Allah’s commands, and fear Allah and know that you will meet Him for reckoning on the Day of Resurrection. And give the believers good tidings, O Prophet, of what will make them happy and please them of the good reward in the Hereafter.
m-0078	And do not let your oath by Allah prevent you from righteousness, maintaining family ties, piety, and reconciliation between people by calling for doing any of these things, and then claiming that you swore by Allah not to do them. Rather, the one who took the oath should change his oath and do righteous deeds and atone for his oath, and not make it a habit. And Allah is Hearing of your words and Knowing of all your conditions. Allah will not punish you because of the oaths you swear without intending to, but He will punish you for what your hearts intended. And Allah is Forgiving to those who repent to Him, Forbearing to those who disobey Him, as He does not hasten to punish them.
m-0079	For those who swear by Allah that they will not have sexual intercourse with their wives, a waiting period of four months is required. But if they return before the expiration of the four months, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. But if they resolve to divorce by continuing their oath and refraining from sexual intercourse, then indeed, Allah is Hearing of their words and Knowing of their intentions, and He will reward them for that.
m-0080	Divorced women who menstruate must wait without marrying after divorce for a period of three purifications or three menstrual periods as a waiting period to ensure that the womb is free of pregnancy. It is not permissible for them to marry another man during this waiting period until it ends. It is not permissible for them to hide what Allah has created in their wombs of pregnancy or menstruation if the divorced women are true believers in Allah and the Last Day. The husbands of divorced women have more right to return to them during the waiting period. This should be with the intention of reform and goodness, not with the intention of harming them by torturing them by prolonging the waiting period. Women have rights over their husbands like those over them in the known manner. Men have an additional status over women in terms of good companionship and treatment in kindness, guardianship of the home, and the power of divorce. Allah is Exalted in Might and Power, Wise, and He puts everything in its appropriate place. The divorce that brings about a return is two times, one after the other. The ruling of Allah after each divorce is to keep the woman in kindness and good treatment after returning to her or releasing her while treating her well by fulfilling her rights and not mentioning her divorcer in a bad way. It is not permissible for you, O husbands, to take anything of what If the husband divorces his wife with a third divorce, she is not lawful for him unless she marries another man in a valid marriage and has intercourse with her in that marriage, and the marriage is based on desire and not with the intention of making the woman permissible for her first husband. If the other husband divorces her or dies and her waiting period expires, there is no sin on the woman and her first husband if they marry with a new contract and a new dowry if they think they can carry out the rulings of Allah that He has prescribed for the spouses. These are the specific rulings of Allah that He explains to a people who know His rulings and limits because they are the ones who benefit from them.
m-0081	And if you divorce women and their waiting period is about to end, then take them back with the intention of fulfilling their rights in the manner that is acceptable according to Islamic law and custom, or leave them until their waiting period is over. Beware that taking them back is not intended to harm them by infringing on their rights. Whoever does that has wronged himself by deserving punishment. Do not take the verses and rulings of Allah as a game and amusement. Remember the blessing of Allah upon you through Islam and the details of the rulings. Remember what Allah has revealed to you of the Qur’an and Sunnah, and thank Him, glory be to Him, for these great blessings. Allah reminds you of this and warns you against disobeying Him. So fear Allah and be mindful of Him, and know that Allah is All-Knowing of everything, nothing is hidden from Him, and He will reward each one according to what he deserves. And if you divorce your women less than three times and their waiting period ends without taking them back, then do not oppress the divorced women by preventing them from returning to their husbands with a new contract if they want to do so and there is mutual consent according to Islamic law and custom. This is advised to whoever among you is sincere in his faith in Allah and the Last Day. Leaving the prevention of marriage and allowing husbands to marry their wives is more Growth and purification of your honor and the greatest benefit and reward for you, and God knows what is good for you and you do not know that
m-0082	Mothers must breastfeed their children for two full years for those who wish to complete the breastfeeding. Fathers must provide for the food and clothing of divorced wet nurses in a manner that is acceptable according to Islamic law and custom, because Allah does not burden a soul beyond its capacity. It is not permissible for parents to make the newborn a means of harm between them. The heir must, upon the death of the father, do the same as the father did before his death in terms of maintenance and clothing. If the parents want to wean the newborn before the end of the two years, there is no blame on them if they agree and consult about that in order to reach what is in the best interest of the newborn. If the parents agree to breastfeed the newborn from another wet nurse other than his mother, there is no blame on them if the father gives the mother her rights and gives the wet nurse her wages according to what is customary among people. Fear Allah in all your affairs, and know that Allah is Seeing of what you do and will reward you for that.
m-0083	And those of you who die and leave wives behind them must wait by themselves for a period of four months and ten days, not leaving the marital home, nor adorning themselves, nor marrying. When the aforementioned period has ended, there is no sin upon you, O guardians of women, for what they do with themselves of going out, adorning themselves, and marrying in the manner prescribed by the Shari’ah. And Allah, the Most High, is All-Knowing of your deeds, both outward and inward, and He will reward you for them. And there is no sin upon you, O men, for what you hint at in asking to marry women whose husbands have died or who have been irrevocably divorced during their waiting period. And there is no sin upon you either in what you conceal in your souls of intending to marry them after their waiting period has ended. Allah knows that you will mention the women in waiting and you will not be able to remain silent about them because of your weakness. Therefore, He has permitted you to mention them by hint or in your heart. And beware of promising them secret marriage through fornication or agreeing to marry during their waiting period, unless you say something from which it is understood that such a woman is desired by husbands and you do not intend to conclude the marriage contract. During the waiting period until its expiration, and know that Allah knows what is in your souls, so fear Him, and know that Allah is Forgiving to those who repent from their sins, Forbearing toward His servants, He does not hasten punishment upon them. There is no sin upon you, O husbands, if you divorce women after the marriage contract has been concluded and before you have had intercourse with them or specified a dowry for them, and provide for them with something that will benefit them, as a compensation for them and to repel the horror of divorce and to remove grudges. This provision is obligatory according to the situation of the divorced man, on the rich according to the extent of his livelihood, and on the poor according to what he owns as a provision in the manner known in the Shari’ah. It is a right established upon those who do good to divorced women and to themselves by obeying Allah. If you divorce women after the marriage contract has been concluded and you have not had intercourse with them, but you have bound yourselves to a specific dowry for them, then you must give them half of the agreed upon dowry, unless the divorced women forgive them, so they leave half of the dowry due to them, or the husband allows the divorced woman to leave the entire dowry. Your forgiveness, O men and women, is closer to fearing Allah and obeying Him. And do not forget, O people, the favor and kindness between you, which is giving what It is not your duty to be tolerant of rights. God is All-Seeing of what you do. He encourages you to do good and urges you to do good.
m-0084	O Muslims, maintain the five obligatory prayers by regularly performing them at their appointed times with their conditions, pillars, and obligations. Maintain the intermediate prayer between them, which is the afternoon prayer, and stand in your prayers obedient to God, humble and submissive. If you fear an enemy, then perform the fear prayer, walking or riding in whatever position you are able, even by gesturing or not in the direction of the Qiblah. If your fear is removed, then perform the safety prayer, and remember God in it, and do not reduce it from its original form, and thank Him for what He taught you of matters of worship and rulings that you did not know before.
m-0085	And the husbands who die and leave wives after them, they must make a will for them that they enjoy a full year from the day of death by living in the husband’s house without the heirs expelling them for the duration of the year, to please the wife and to be dutiful to the deceased. If the wives leave of their own free will before the end of the year, then there is no sin on you, O heirs, in that, and there is no blame on the wives for what they do with themselves of permissible matters. And Allah is Exalted in His Kingdom, Wise in His command and prohibition. This verse is abrogated by the saying of Allah the Most High: And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days. And for divorced women there is a provision of clothing and maintenance in a manner acceptable and acceptable to the Shari’ah. This is a duty upon those who fear Allah and are mindful of Him in His command and prohibition. Like that clear statement in the rulings on children and women, Allah makes clear to you His verses and rulings in everything you need in your life and your afterlife, so that you may understand them and act upon them.
m-0086	"Did you not know, O Messenger, the story of those who fled their land and homes, and they were thousands, for fear of death from the plague or fighting, so Allah said to them, ""Die,"" and they died all at once as a punishment for their flight from Allah's decree. Then Allah revived them after a while so that they might complete their appointed times and take heed and repent. Indeed, Allah is full of great favor to mankind with His many blessings, but most people do not thank Allah for His favor upon them. And fight, O Muslims, the disbelievers to support the religion of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearing of your words and Knowing of your intentions and deeds. Who is it that spends in the cause of Allah with good spending, expecting reward? So He will multiply it for him many times over, innumerable in reward and good recompense? And Allah withholds and expands, so spend and do not worry, for He is the Provider. He restricts provision for whomever He wills of His servants and expands it for others. His is the perfect wisdom in that, and to Him alone you will return after death, so He will reward you for your deeds."
m-0087	Did you not know, O Messenger, the story of the nobles and dignitaries of the Children of Israel after the time of Moses, when they asked their prophet to appoint a king over them so that they could gather under his leadership and fight their enemies in the way of God? Their prophet said to them, “Is the matter as I expect it to be? If fighting in the way of God is imposed upon you, that you will not fight, then I expect you to be cowardly and flee from the fight.” They said, in astonishment, “What prevents us from fighting in the way of God when we have expelled our enemy from our homes and distanced ourselves from our children by killing and capturing them?” So when God imposed fighting upon them with the king He appointed for them, they were cowardly and fled from the fight, except for a few of them who stood firm by the grace of God. And God is Knowing of the wrongdoers who break their covenants.
m-0088	"Their prophet said to them, ""Allah has sent you Talut as a king in response to your request, leading you to fight your enemy as you requested."" The leaders of the Children of Israel said, ""How can Talut be a king over us when he does not deserve that? Because he is not from the tribe of kings or from the house of prophecy, and he was not given a lot of money to help him in his kingdom, we are more deserving of the kingdom than him because we are from the tribe of kings and from the house of prophecy."" Their prophet said to them, ""Allah has chosen him over you, and He, glory be to Him, is most knowledgeable about the affairs of His servants. He has increased his knowledge and strength of body to fight the enemy. Allah is the Owner of the kingdom. He gives His kingdom to whomever He wills of His servants. Allah is vast in bounty and giving. He is All-Knowing of the truth of matters. Nothing is hidden from Him."" Their prophet said to them, ""The sign of his kingdom is that the box containing the Torah will come to you, and their enemies had taken it from them. In it is reassurance from your Lord that strengthens the hearts of the sincere. In it is a remnant of some things that the family of Moses and the family of Aaron left behind, such as the staff and fragments of the tablets, carried by the angels. Indeed in that is the greatest proof for you of the choice of Talut as a king over you by the command of Allah, if you believe in Allah and His messengers."""
m-0089	When Talut went out with his soldiers to fight the giants, he said to them, “Allah is testing you for patience by crossing a river ahead of you, so that the believer may be distinguished from the hypocrite. Whoever among you drinks from the river’s water is not of me and is not fit to fight with me. Whoever does not taste the water is of me because he is obedient to my command and fit to fight, except for whoever is lenient and takes a handful with his hand, for there is no blame upon him.” When they reached the river, they threw themselves into the water and drank excessively from it, except for a few of them who were patient with the thirst and heat and were content with taking a handful with their hand. At that time, the rebels stayed behind. When Talut crossed the river with the few believers with him, who were three hundred and a few men, to meet the enemy and saw the great number of their enemy and their equipment, they said, “We have no power today against Goliath and his mighty soldiers.” Those who were certain of meeting Allah responded, reminding their brothers of Allah and His power, saying, “How many a small, patient, believing group has overcome, by Allah’s permission and command, a large, disbelieving, rebellious group. Allah is with the patient, with His guidance, victory, and good reward.” They appeared to Goliath and his soldiers and saw the danger with their own eyes, so they turned to God with supplication and entreaty, saying, “Our Lord, send down upon our hearts great patience and make our feet firm and make them firm in fighting the enemy. Do not flee from the horror of war and grant us victory with Your help and support over the disbelieving people.” So they defeated them with God’s permission, and David, peace be upon him, killed Goliath, the leader of the giants. After that, God Almighty gave David the kingdom and prophethood among the Children of Israel and taught him whatever knowledge He wanted. Had it not been that God repels some people, who are the people of obedience to Him and faith in Him, and others, who are the people of disobedience to God and polytheism with Him, the earth would have been corrupted by the prevalence of disbelief and the empowerment of tyranny and the people of disobedience. But God is full of grace to all creatures. These are the proofs and evidences of God, which We relate to you, O Prophet, with truth, and you are indeed among the truthful messengers.
m-0090	These noble messengers, Allah favored some of them over others according to what Allah bestowed upon them. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke, such as Moses and Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon them. This is proof of the attribute of speech for Allah, the Almighty, in a manner befitting His Majesty. Among them were those whom Allah raised to high ranks, such as Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, due to the universality of his message and the sealing of prophethood with him, and the preference of his nation over all nations, and other things. Allah, the Almighty, gave Jesus, son of Mary, peace be upon him, clear signs and dazzling miracles, such as healing a child who was born blind by Allah’s permission, and a person who had leprosy by Allah’s permission, and bringing the dead back to life by Allah’s permission, and supporting him with Gabriel, peace be upon him. If Allah had willed that those who came after these messengers would not fight each other after the clear signs had come to them, they would not have fought each other. However, differences arose among them. Among them were those who remained steadfast in their faith, and among them were those who persisted in their disbelief. If Allah had willed, after differences arose among them that necessitated fighting, they would not have fought. But Allah guides whomever He wills to obey Him and believe in Him, and He disappoints whomever He wills to disobey Him and disbelieve in Him. He does what He wills and chooses. O you who have believed in Allah and believed in His Messenger. And you acted upon His guidance. Pay the obligatory zakat and give in charity from what God has given you before the coming of the Day of Resurrection when there will be no trading to make profit, no money to ransom yourselves from the punishment of God, no friendship to save you, and no intercessor who has the power to lighten the punishment for you. And the disbelievers are the wrongdoers who transgress the limits of God.
m-0091	Allah, who is the only One worthy of divinity and worship, is the Living One who has all the meanings of perfect life as befits His Majesty, the One who is established over all things. He is not overcome by drowsiness or sleep. Everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Him, and no one dares to intercede with Him except by His permission. His knowledge encompasses all beings, their past, present, and future. He knows what is before the hands of His creation of future matters and what is behind them of past matters. No one among creation is informed of anything of His knowledge except what Allah has informed him of and made him aware of. His Throne encompasses the heavens and the earth. The Throne is the place of the feet of the Lord, may He be glorified and exalted. No one knows its nature except Allah, glory be to Him, and He is not burdened by preserving them. He is the Most High in His essence and attributes over all His creation. He encompasses all the attributes of greatness and pride. This verse is the greatest verse in the Qur’an and is called the Throne Verse.
m-0092	Because this religion is perfect and its verses are clear, there is no need for coercion for those who accept the jizyah. The evidence is clear, and it distinguishes truth from falsehood and guidance from misguidance. Whoever disbelieves in everything worshipped besides God and believes in God has been steadfast and upright on the best path and has held fast to the religion with the strongest and most uninterrupted reason. God is All-Hearing of the words of His servants, All-Knowing of their actions and intentions, and He will reward them for that.
m-0093	God takes care of the believers with His victory, guidance and protection. He brings them out from the darkness of disbelief into the light of faith. As for those who disbelieve, their supporters and allies are the rivals and idols whom they worship instead of God. They bring them out from the light of faith into the darkness of disbelief. Those are the companions of the Fire, abiding therein. They will remain therein forever. They will not emerge from it.
m-0094	Have you seen, O Messenger, anything more amazing than the situation of the one who argued with Abraham, peace be upon him, about the oneness of God Almighty and His Lordship? Because God gave him the kingdom, he was arrogant and asked Abraham, “Who is your Lord?” He, peace be upon him, said, “My Lord is He who gives life to the creatures so they live and takes away life so they die. He is the One who gives life and causes death.” He said, “I give life and cause death,” meaning I kill whomever I want to kill and spare whomever I want to spare. Abraham said to him, “The God I worship brings the sun from the east. Can you change this divine law by making it come from the west?” This infidel was confused and his argument was cut off. He is like the oppressors, whom God does not guide to the truth and right path.
m-0095	Or have you seen, O Messenger, the example of the one who passed by a village whose houses had collapsed and whose roofs had fallen? He said, “How can Allah revive this village after its death?” So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then He restored his soul to him and said to him, “How long did you remain dead?” He said, “I remained a day or part of a day.” So he informed him that he remained dead for a hundred years, and he ordered him to look at his food and drink and how Allah preserved them from changing for this long period. He ordered him to look at his donkey and how Allah revived it after it had been scattered bones. He said to it, “And We will make you a sign for the people,” meaning a clear indication of Allah’s ability to resurrect after death. He ordered him to look at the bones and how Allah raises some of them on top of others and joins some of them with others, then covers them with flesh after they are healed, then restores life to them. So when that became clear to him clearly, he acknowledged the greatness of Allah and that He is capable of all things, and he became a sign for the people.
m-0096	And remember, O Messenger, Abraham’s request to his Lord to show him how the Resurrection will be. God said to him, “Do you not believe?” He said, “Yes, but I ask that in order to increase my certainty.” He said, “Then take four birds, gather them together, slaughter them, and cut them into pieces. Then place a part of them on every mountain. Then call to them, and they will come to you quickly.” So Abraham, peace be upon him, called, and at once each part returned to its place, and at once they came quickly. And know that God is Exalted in Might, and nothing overcomes Him. He is Wise in His words and actions, His law and His decree.
m-0097	And among the greatest benefits from which the believers benefit is spending in the way of Allah. The example of the believers who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is like that of a seed planted in good soil, and behold, it produces a stalk from which seven branches branch, each one having an ear, and in each ear is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies the reward for whomever He wills according to the faith and complete sincerity in the heart of the spender. And the grace of Allah is vast, and He, glory be to Him, is All-Knowing of who deserves it and All-Aware of the intentions of His servants. Those who spend their wealth in jihad and other forms of good deeds, and then do not follow up what they have spent of good deeds with favors against those who gave it, or with harm, by word or deed, that would make him feel favored by Him, will have their great reward with their Lord, and they will have no fear regarding what they will face in the Hereafter, nor will they grieve over anything they have missed in this world. Kind words and forgiveness for what the beggar has done of insistence in asking are better than charity followed by harm and abuse from the giver. And Allah is free from need of the charities of His servants, Forbearing and does not hasten to punish them. O you who believe in Allah and the Last Day, do not waste the reward of what you give in charity with reminders and harm, for this is similar to what He spends his money so that people can see it and praise it, but he does not believe in God or have faith in the Last Day. So his example is like that of a smooth stone covered with dust, on which heavy rain falls, removing the dust and leaving it smooth with nothing on it. So likewise these hypocrites, their deeds are insignificant before God, and they find no reward for what they spend. And God does not guide the disbelievers to attain the truth in their spending or anything else.
m-0098	And the example of those who spend their wealth seeking the pleasure of Allah and in firm belief in the truth of His promise is like that of a large garden in high, good land, upon which abundant rain falls, so its fruits multiply. But if abundant rain does not fall on it, the drizzle of rain is sufficient for it to produce the multiplied fruit. And thus the expenditures of the sincere are accepted by Allah and multiplied, whether little or much. Allah is the Knower of secrets, the Seeer of the outward and the inward. He rewards each according to his sincerity. Would one of you desire to have a garden with palm trees and grapes, with fresh water flowing beneath its trees, and in which he has all kinds of fruits, when he has reached old age and is unable to plant such a plantation, and he has young children who need this garden? In this case, a strong wind blows upon it with a scorching fire and burns it? And thus is the case of those who are not sincere in their expenditures. They will come on the Day of Resurrection with no good for them. And with such a statement, Allah makes clear to you what will benefit you so that you may reflect and devote your expenditures to Allah.
m-0099	O you who have believed in Me and followed My messengers, spend from the lawful and good which you have earned and from that which We have produced for you from the earth. And do not seek the bad thereof in order to give it to the poor. And if you were to give it to them, you would not take it except if you overlooked the badness and deficiency in it. So how can you be pleased with Allah that which you would not be pleased with for yourselves? And know that Allah, Who has provided for you, is independent of your charity. He is worthy of praise and is praised in every situation. This stinginess and choosing the bad for charity is from the devil who frightens you with poverty and tempts you to be stingy and orders you to disobey and disobey Allah the Most High. And Allah, the Most High, promises you, for your spending, forgiveness for your sins and abundant provision. And Allah is Bountiful and Knowing of deeds and intentions. Allah gives accuracy in word and deed to whomever He wills of His servants. And whoever Allah bestows that upon, He has given him much good. And none remembers this and benefits from it except those with minds enlightened by the light and guidance of Allah.
m-0100	Whatever you give of wealth or other things, whether much or little, in charity, seeking the pleasure of Allah, or you oblige yourselves to do something of wealth or other things, Allah knows it, and He is the Knower of your intentions, and He will reward you for that. And whoever prevents the right of Allah is a wrongdoer, and the wrongdoers will have no helpers to protect them from the punishment of Allah. If you disclose what you give in charity for Allah, then good is what you give in charity. But if you keep it secret and give it to the poor, this is better for you because it is further from showing off. In charity with sincerity, your sins are erased. And Allah, who knows the smallest details of matters, nothing of your conditions is hidden from Him, and He will reward each one according to his deeds.
m-0101	You are not, O Messenger, responsible for the guidance of the disbelievers to guidance, but Allah opens the hearts of whom He wills to His religion and guides him to it. And whatever wealth you spend, its benefit is counted for you from Allah. And the believers do not spend except seeking the pleasure of Allah. And whatever wealth you spend, sincerely for Allah, you will receive its reward in full and not diminish anything of it. And in the verse is confirmation of the attribute of the face of Allah, the Most High, in a manner befitting Him, the Most Glorified. Give your charity to the poor Muslims who are unable to travel in search of a livelihood because they are busy with jihad in the way of Allah. Those who do not know them think that they are not in need of charity because they are too modest to ask. You know them by their signs and the signs of need in them. They do not ask people at all, and if they ask out of necessity, they do not insist in asking. And whatever wealth you spend in the way of Allah, nothing of it is hidden from Allah, and He will reward you with the most abundant and complete reward on the Day of Resurrection. Those who spend their wealth, seeking the pleasure of Allah, by night and by day, secretly and publicly, will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them regarding what they will face in the Hereafter, nor will they grieve over what they have lost. They missed out on the worldly fortunes of this wise divine legislation, which is the Islamic method of spending, as it includes meeting the needs of the poor with dignity and pride, purifying the wealth of the rich, and achieving cooperation in righteousness and piety, seeking the face of God without coercion or compulsion.
m-0102	Those who deal in usury, which is an increase in capital, will not rise in the Hereafter from their graves except as one who is driven mad by Satan rises. This is because they said, “Trade is like usury in that both are permissible and lead to an increase in wealth.” So Allah belied them and explained that He permitted trade and prohibited usury because of the benefit in buying and selling for individuals and groups, and because of the exploitation, loss, and destruction in usury. Whoever is informed of Allah’s prohibition of usury and is deterred, then he is entitled to what has passed before the prohibition reached him, there is no sin upon him in it, and his affair is up to Allah regarding what will come of his time. If he continues in his repentance, then Allah does not waste the reward of the righteous. Whoever returns to usury and does it after he has been informed of Allah’s prohibition, then he deserves punishment and the proof has been established against him. For this reason, the Almighty said, “Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.” Allah removes all usury or deprives its owner of the blessing of his wealth, so he does not benefit from it. He increases charity and multiplies it, and doubles the reward for those who give charity and blesses them in their wealth. Allah does not love anyone who persists in his disbelief, considers usury permissible, persists in sin and what is forbidden. And the sins of God
m-0103	"Those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and do good deeds and perform the prayer as Allah and His Messenger have commanded and give the zakat of their wealth will have a great reward with their Lord and Provider. They will not be affected by fear in the Hereafter nor will they grieve over what they have missed of their worldly fortunes. O you who have believed in Allah and followed His Messenger, fear Allah and leave off seeking what remains for you of more than your capital which you had before usury was forbidden, if you are true to your faith in word and deed. But if you do not desist from what Allah has forbidden you, then be certain of war from Allah and His Messenger. And if you return to your Lord and leave off consuming usury, then you may take back what you owe without any increase. You will not wrong anyone by taking more than your capital, nor will anyone wrong you by reducing what you have lent. And if the debtor is unable to pay, then give him time until Allah facilitates for him a provision, then he will pay you your money. But if you leave all or part of the capital and give it to the debtor, that is better for you, if you know the virtue of that and that it is better for you in this world. And the Hereafter
And beware, O people, of a day when you will be returned to God, which is the Day of Resurrection, when you will be presented before God to hold you accountable and reward each one of you for what he did of good or evil without any injustice being inflicted upon him. And in the verse there is an indication that avoiding what God has forbidden of usurious earnings is a completion of faith and its rights, such as establishing prayer, paying zakat, and doing good deeds."
m-0104	O you who believe in Allah and follow His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, if you deal with a debt for a specific time, then write it down in order to preserve the money and prevent disputes. Let the writing be done by a trustworthy and precise man, and let no one whom Allah has taught to write refrain from doing so. Let the debtor dictate what he owes of the debt and be mindful of his Lord and not diminish anything from his debt. If the debtor is under guardianship due to his extravagance and wastefulness, or is a minor or insane or is unable to speak due to muteness or complete inability to speak, then let the debtor take charge of dictating on his behalf. Ask for the testimony of two adult, sane Muslim men who are people of justice. If there are no two men, then ask for the testimony of a man and two women whose testimony you accept, so that if one of them forgets, the other can remind her. The witnesses must respond to whoever calls them to testify, and they must pay it when called upon. Do not tire of writing down the debt, whether little or much, until its specific time. This is more just in the law of Allah and His guidance, and is a greater help in establishing and paying testimony, and is closer to eliminating doubt about the type and amount of the debt. And its term, but if the issue is a matter of buying and selling by taking a commodity and paying its price immediately, then there is no need for writing, and it is recommended to have witnesses to that in order to prevent dispute and discord. It is obligatory for the witness and the writer to perform the testimony in the proper manner and write as Allah has commanded. It is not permissible for the owner of the right and the one against whom the right is owed to harm the writer and witnesses. Likewise, it is not permissible for the writer and witnesses to harm those who need their writing or testimony. If you do what you have been forbidden from, then it is a departure from the obedience of Allah and the consequences of that will be upon you. Fear Allah in all that He has commanded you to do and what He has forbidden you to do. Allah teaches you everything that is good for your worldly life and your afterlife. Allah is All-Knowing of all things, and nothing of your affairs is hidden from Him. He will reward you for that. If you are traveling and do not find someone to write for you, then give the owner of the right something that will be with him as a guarantee for his right until the debtor returns what he owes. If some of you trust each other, then there is no harm in leaving out writing, witnessing, and mortgaging. The debt remains a trust in the debtor’s care, and he must pay it. He must be mindful of Allah and not betray his companion. If the debtor denies what he owes and there are those who are present, then And he who testifies must show his testimony, and whoever conceals this testimony is a person with a treacherous and immoral heart, and God, who knows the secrets and encompasses all your affairs, will hold you accountable for that.
m-0105	To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them - dominion, management, and encompassment. Nothing is hidden from Him. Whatever you disclose of what is in your souls or conceal - Allah knows it and will hold you accountable for it. He will pardon whom He wills and punish whom He wills. Allah is Able to do all things. Allah honored the Muslims after that, so He pardoned the talk of the soul and the thoughts of the heart as long as they were not followed by words or deeds, as was proven from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, believed and was certain of what was revealed to him from his Lord, and it is right for him to be certain. The believers also believed and acted according to the Great Qur’an. Each of them believed in Allah as Lord and God, characterized by the attributes of majesty and perfection, and that Allah has honorable angels and that He sent down books and sent messengers to His creation. We, the believers, do not believe in some of them and deny some of them, but we believe in all of them. The Messenger and the believers said, “We have heard, O our Lord, what You have revealed and we obey in all of that. We hope that You will forgive our sins by Your grace, for You are the One who raised us with what You have bestowed upon us, and to You alone is our return and our final destination.” The religion of Allah is easy and there is no difficulty in it. Allah does not ask of His servants what they cannot bear. Whoever does good will receive good, and whoever does evil will receive evil. Our Lord, do not punish us if we have forgotten anything that You have enjoined upon us or erred in doing something that You have forbidden us to do. Our Lord, and do not charge us with hard work like that which You charged those who disobeyed before us as punishment for them. Our Lord, and do not burden us with what we cannot bear of duties and calamities. Blot out our sins, conceal our faults, and be good to us. You are the Master of our affairs and its Manager, so grant us victory over those who have denied Your religion, rejected Your Oneness, and belied Your Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. And make the outcome for us better than theirs in this world and the Hereafter.
m-0106	"It was previously discussed in the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

He is Allah, there is no true deity except Him, characterized by perfect life as befits His Majesty, the One who is in control of all things

He has sent down the Qur’an to you with the truth about which there is no doubt, confirming what came before it of books and messengers. He sent down the Torah to Moses, peace be upon him, and the Gospel to Jesus, peace be upon him, before the revelation of the Qur’an, to guide the righteous to faith and to improve their religion and their worldly affairs. He sent down that which distinguishes between truth and falsehood. But those who disbelieve in the revealed verses of Allah - for them is a great punishment. And Allah is Exalted in Might, and no vengeful can overcome those who deny His proofs and evidence and His uniqueness in divinity

He has sent down the Qur’an to you with the truth about which there is no doubt, confirming what came before it of books and messengers. He sent down the Torah to Moses, peace be upon him, and the Gospel to Jesus, peace be upon him, before the revelation of the Qur’an, to guide the righteous to faith and to improve their religion and their worldly affairs. He sent down that which distinguishes between truth and falsehood. But those who disbelieve in the revealed verses of Allah - for them is a great punishment. And Allah is Exalted in Might, and no vengeful can overcome those who deny His proofs and evidence and His uniqueness in divinity.

Indeed, Allah encompasses His knowledge of creation, nothing is hidden from Him on earth or in heaven, little or much. He alone is the One who creates you in the wombs of your mothers as He wills, male and female, good and bad, miserable and happy. There is no true deity except Him, the Almighty, who cannot be overcome, the Wise in His command and management. He alone is the One who sent down to you the Qur’an. Some of its verses are clear in meaning, and they are the foundation of the Book to which one returns when in doubt, and to which one refers what contradicts it. Other verses are ambiguous and bear some meanings, and the intended meaning cannot be determined except by adding them to the definitive verses. So those with sick hearts that have gone astray, due to their bad intentions, follow these ambiguous verses alone to raise doubts among people so that they may lead them astray, and to interpret them according to their false doctrines. No one knows the true meanings of these verses except Allah. Those who are well-versed in knowledge say, “We believe in this entire Qur’an, which has come to us from our Lord through the tongue of His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace.” They refer its ambiguous verses to its definitive verses, and only those with sound minds understand, comprehend, and ponder the meanings in their correct manner."
m-0107	And they say, “O our Lord, do not turn our hearts away from believing in You after You have bestowed upon us guidance to Your religion, and grant us from Your bounty an abundant mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower, abundant in bounty and giving. You give to whom You will without account.” O our Lord, we acknowledge and bear witness that You will gather the people on a day about which there is no doubt, which is the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You do not fail to fulfill what You have promised Your servants.
m-0108	Those who have denied and rejected the true religion, their wealth and their children will not benefit them at all from the punishment of Allah if it befalls them in this world, nor will it ward it off from them in the Hereafter. These are the fuel of the Fire on the Day of Resurrection. The affair of the disbelievers in their denial and what befalls them is the affair of the people of Pharaoh and those before them of the disbelievers. They denied the clear signs of Allah, so He hastened the punishment for them because of their denial and stubbornness. And Allah is severe in punishment for those who disbelieve in Him and reject His Messengers. Say, O Messenger, to those who disbelieved among the Jews and others and those who belittled your victory at Badr, “You will be defeated in this world and you will die in disbelief and will be herded into the fire of Hell to be a permanent bed for you. What an evil bed that is.” You, O arrogant and stubborn Jews, have had a great sign in two groups that met in the Battle of Badr. One group fought for the sake of the religion of Allah, namely Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his companions, and another group that disbelieved in Allah and fought for falsehood. You saw the believers in number twice theirs with your own eyes. And Allah made that a reason for the victory of the Muslims over them. And Allah supports with His victory whomever He wills of O servants, what happened is a great lesson for those with insight who are guided to God’s judgment and actions.
m-0109	Good for people is the love of desires of women and children and great wealth of gold and silver and beautiful horses and livestock of camels, cows and sheep and land used for planting and cultivation. That is the flower of the worldly life and its passing adornment, but Allah has with Him the best return and reward, which is Paradise. Say, O Messenger, shall I inform you of something better than what has been made attractive to people in this worldly life for those who observe Allah and fear His punishment? Gardens beneath whose palaces and trees rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. And for them therein are spouses purified from menstruation, childbirth and bad character. And for them is greater than that, the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is aware of the secrets of His creation, and is aware of their conditions, and He will reward them for that. These righteous servants say, “We have believed in You and followed Your Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so erase from us the sins we have committed and save us from the punishment of the Fire.” They are those who are characterized by patience in acts of obedience and disobedience and in the face of the painful decrees of Allah, and by truthfulness in words and deeds, by complete obedience, by spending secretly and publicly, and by seeking forgiveness at the end of the night because it is the time when acceptance and response are likely. Prayer
m-0110	Allah testified that He is the One and Only in divinity, and He coupled His testimony with the testimony of the angels and the people of knowledge for a witnessed purpose, which is His Oneness, the Most High, and His establishment of justice. There is no god but He, the Almighty, from whom nothing is impossible, as the Wise willed in His words and deeds. The religion that Allah chose for His creation and sent His messengers with, and He does not accept anything else, is Islam, and it is submission to Allah alone through obedience and surrender to Him through servitude and following the messengers in what Allah sent them with at all times until they concluded with Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after whom Allah does not accept any religion from anyone after his mission other than the Islam with which he was sent. And the disagreement did not occur between the People of the Book, the Jews and the Christians, and they split into sects and parties except after the proof was established against them by sending the messengers and revealing the books, out of envy and jealousy, seeking the world. And whoever denies the revealed verses of Allah and His verses indicating His Lordship and Divinity, then Allah is swift in reckoning and will reward them for what they used to do. If the People of the Book argue with you, O Messenger, about monotheism after you have established the proof against them, then say to them, “I have been sincere to Allah alone, so do not…” I associate with Him anyone, and likewise those who follow me from among the believers, be sincere to God and submit to Him, and say to them and to the polytheists of the Arabs and others, if you submit, then you are on the straight path and guidance and truth, and if you turn away, then your account is with God, and I have nothing upon me except the conveyance, and I have conveyed to you and established the proof against you, and God is Seeing of the servants, nothing of their affair is hidden from Him.
m-0111	Those who deny the clear proofs and what the messengers brought and kill the prophets of Allah unjustly without right and kill those who enjoin justice and following the way of the prophets - give them tidings of a painful punishment. Those are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter. So no work will be accepted of them, and they will have no helper to protect them from the punishment of Allah.
m-0112	Have you seen, O Messenger, the most amazing state of these Jews to whom Allah has given a portion of the Book, and they know that what you have brought is the truth? They call to what is in the Book of Allah, which is the Qur’an, to decide between them in what they differed about. If it does not agree with their desires, many of them refuse Allah’s judgment, because it is their habit to turn away from the truth. This turning away from the truth is due to a corrupt belief among the People of the Book that they will not be punished except for a few days. This belief led to their audacity towards Allah, their disdain for His religion, and their persistence in their false religion with which they deceived themselves. So what will be their state when Allah gathers them to be held accountable on a day whose occurrence there is no doubt, which is the Day of Resurrection, and each one receives the recompense for what he earned, and they will not be wronged in the least?
m-0113	Say, O Prophet, addressing your Lord in supplication, “O He to Whom belongs all dominion, You are the One who grants dominion, wealth, and empowerment on earth to whomever You will of Your creation, and You take away dominion from whomever You will. You bestow honor in this world and the Hereafter on whomever You will, and You place humiliation on whomever You will. In Your hand is goodness. Indeed, You alone are over all things competent.” And in the verse is proof of the attribute of the hand of God Almighty, as befits Him, glory be to Him. And among the signs of Your power is that You make the night enter the day and make the day enter the night, so that one lengthens and the other shortens. You bring forth the living from the dead in which there is no life, like bringing forth a plant from a grain, and the believer from the disbeliever. You bring forth the dead from the living, like bringing forth an egg from a chicken. You provide for whomever You will of Your creation without account.
m-0114	Allah forbids the believers to take the disbelievers as allies in love and support instead of the believers. And whoever takes them as allies has disavowed Allah, and Allah is disavowed of him, unless you are weak and fearful. Allah has given you permission to be truce with them in order to avoid their evil until your power becomes strong. And Allah warns you of Himself, so fear Him and be afraid of Him. And to Allah alone is the return of creation for reckoning and recompense. Say, O Prophet, to the believers: If you conceal what has settled in your hearts of befriending the disbelievers and supporting them, or if you reveal it, nothing of it is hidden from Allah, for His knowledge encompasses everything in the heavens and everything on the earth, and He has complete power over all things. And on the Day of Resurrection, the Day of Judgment, every soul will find what it has done of good waiting for it in abundance so that it may be rewarded for it, and what it has done of evil will find it waiting for it as well, so it will wish that there was a long time between it and this action. So prepare for this day and fear the wrath of the Almighty God. Despite the severity of His punishment, He, glory be to Him, is Kind to His servants.
m-0115	Say, O Messenger, if you truly love Allah, then follow me and believe in me outwardly and inwardly, Allah will love you and erase your sins. Indeed, He is Forgiving of the sins of His believing servants, Most Merciful to them. This noble verse is a ruling on everyone who claims to love Allah Almighty but does not follow His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the right way, obeying him in his commands and prohibitions, for he is a liar in his claim until he follows the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the right way. Say, O Messenger, obey Allah by following His Book and obey the Messenger by following his Sunnah during his life and after his death. If they turn away from you and persist in their disbelief and misguidance, then they are not worthy of Allah’s love, for Allah does not love the disbelievers.
m-0116	Allah chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran and made them the best people of their time. These prophets and messengers are a continuous chain of purity in their sincerity to Allah, their monotheism, and their work according to His revelation. Allah hears the words of His servants, knows their actions, and will reward them for that. Remember, O Messenger, what happened to Mary, her mother, and her son Jesus, peace be upon him, so that you may respond to those who claimed the divinity of Jesus or his sonship to Allah, the Most High, when the wife of Imran said when she became pregnant, “O Lord, I have made what is in my womb purely for You in the service of the Holy House, so accept it from me. Indeed, You alone are the Hearer of my supplication, the Knower of my intention.” When her pregnancy was complete and she gave birth to her child, she said, “O Lord, I have given birth to a female, who is not fit to serve in the Holy House. Allah knows best what she gave birth to, and Allah will make her a matter for her.” She said, “The male I intended for service is not like the female in that, because the male is stronger in service and I can do it. And I named her Mary, and I have protected her and her offspring with You from Satan, who was expelled from Your mercy.” So Allah answered her supplication and accepted her vow in the best way and took care of her daughter Mary. By taking care of her, she grew well, and Allah made it easy for her to be a guardian for Zakariya, peace be upon him, so he settled her in his place of worship. Whenever he entered this place, he found with her a good provision prepared. He said, “O Mary, from where did you get this good provision?” She said, “It is provision from Allah. Indeed, Allah, by His grace, provides for whomever He wills of His creation without account.” When Zakariya saw the provision and grace with which Allah had honored Mary, he turned to his Lord, saying, “O my Lord, give me from Yourself a righteous and blessed son. Indeed, You are the Hearer of the supplication of those who call upon You.” The angels called out to him while he was standing before Allah in his place of prayer, calling upon Him, “Allah informs you of good news that will please you, which is that you will be blessed with a son named Yahya who will be true to the word of Allah, and he is Jesus, son of Mary, peace be upon him. Yahya will be a master among his people, with a high status and position, chaste, not committing sins and harmful desires, and he will be a prophet from the righteous who have reached the peak of righteousness.” Zakariya said, joyfully and amazed, “My Lord, how can I have a boy when old age has reached its peak in me and my wife is barren and cannot bear children?” He said: Thus does God do what He wills of wondrous deeds contrary to the norm. Zachariah said: My Lord, make for me a sign by which I may know that I have a child, so that I may attain joy and good tidings. He said: Your sign which I have asked for is that you will not be able to speak to people for three days except by gesture to them, even though you are sound and healthy. During this period, you will remember your Lord more and pray to Him at the end and beginning of the day.
m-0117	And remember, O Messenger, when the angels said, “O Mary, God has chosen you for His obedience and purified you from immoral morals and has chosen you over the women of the worlds in your time.” O Mary, continue to obey your Lord and stand in humility and submission and prostrate and bow with those who bow in gratitude to God for the blessings He has bestowed upon you. This is what We have related to you, O Messenger, of the news of the unseen that God revealed to you when you were not with them when they differed about the guardianship of Mary, who among them had the most right to her and the most deserving, and a dispute arose between them, so they drew lots to cast their lots, and Zachariah, peace be upon him, won the guardianship of her.
m-0118	And you, O Prophet of God, were not there when the angels said, O Mary, indeed God gives you good tidings of a son whose existence will be by a word from God, that is, He says to him, “Be,” and he will be named the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary. He will have great prestige in this world and the Hereafter, and he will be among those brought near to God on the Day of Resurrection. He will speak to people in the cradle after his birth, and he will also speak to them in his old age with what God has revealed to him. This is the speech of prophecy, calling, and guidance. He is counted among the people of righteousness and virtue in his words and deeds. Mary said, astonished at this matter, “How can I have a son when I am neither married nor unmarried?” The angel said to her, “This that is happening to you is not impossible for the Almighty God who creates whatever He wills from nothing. When He wants to create something, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is. He will teach him writing, correct speech and action, the Torah that God revealed to Moses, peace be upon him, and the Gospel that God sent down to him. He will make him a messenger to the Children of Israel and will tell them, “I have come to you with a sign from your Lord that indicates that I am a messenger from God, which is that I will make for you from clay something like the shape of a bird, then I will breathe into it and it will be a real bird, by God’s permission.” And I heal the blind and the leprous, and I revive the dead by Allah's permission, and I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your homes of your food. Indeed, in these great matters that are beyond the power of humans, there is evidence that I am the Prophet of Allah and His Messenger, if you believe in the proofs of Allah and His signs, and acknowledge His Oneness. And I have come to you confirming what is in the Torah and to make lawful for you, by revelation from Allah, some of what Allah has forbidden you, as an alleviation from Allah and a mercy. And I have come to you with a proof from your Lord confirming the truth of what I say to you, so fear Allah and do not disobey His command, and obey me in what I convey to you from Allah. Indeed, Allah, to whom I call you, is my Lord and your Lord alone, so worship Him, for I and you are equal in servitude and submission to Him, and this is the path in which there is no crookedness.
m-0119	When Jesus sensed their determination to disbelieve, he called out to his sincere companions: “Who will be with me in supporting the religion of God?” He said: “The chosen ones of Jesus, we are the supporters of the religion of God and those who call to it. We believe in God and follow you, and you bear witness, O Jesus, that we submit to God in monotheism and obedience. Our Lord, we believe in what You revealed of the Gospel and we follow Your Messenger Jesus, peace be upon him. So make us among those who bear witness to Your oneness and to the message of Your prophets. They are the nation of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, who bear witness to the messengers that they conveyed the message to their nations.”
m-0120	"And the disbelievers among the Children of Israel plotted against Jesus, peace be upon him, by assigning someone to kill him by treachery. So God cast the likeness of Jesus on a man who led them to him, so they seized him, killed him, and crucified him, thinking that he was Jesus, peace be upon him. And God is the best of plotters. In this is proof of the attribute of plotting for God Almighty, as befits His Majesty and Perfection, because He plotted with truth and in opposition to the plotting of plotters. And God plotted against them when God said to Jesus, “I will seize you from the earth without any harm befalling you, and I will raise you to Me with your body and your soul, and I will save you from those who disbelieved in you, and I will make those who followed you, that is, on your religion and what you brought from God of religion and the good news of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and believed in Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, after his mission and adhered to his law, victorious over those who denied your prophethood until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your final destination, all of you, on the Day of Judgment, and I will judge between you concerning that in which you differed concerning Jesus, peace be upon him. As for those who disbelieved in the Messiah from the Jews or exaggerated in it from the Christians, I will punish them with a severe punishment in this world by killing and plundering. Money and the removal of the kingdom and in the Hereafter in the Fire and they will have no helper to aid them and repel from them the punishment of Allah.

As for those who believed in Allah and His messengers and did righteous deeds, Allah will give them the reward of their deeds in full, without any reduction. And Allah does not love the wrongdoers through polytheism and disbelief.

That which We have related to you concerning Jesus is from the clear evidence of the truth of your message and the truth of the wise Qur’an which distinguishes between truth and falsehood, so there is no doubt or uncertainty about it."
m-0121	The creation of Jesus by God without a father is like the creation of Adam by God without a father or mother, when He created him from the dust of the earth and then said to him, “Be a human being,” and he was. So the claim that Jesus is divine because he was created without a father is a false claim, for Adam, peace be upon him, was created without a father or a mother, and everyone agreed that he was a servant of God. The truth about Jesus that is not in doubt is what came to you, O Messenger, from your Lord, so indicate your certainty and what you are upon in abandoning falsehood, and do not be among those who doubt. In this is confirmation and reassurance for the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace. So whoever argues with you, O Messenger, about the Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, after what has come to you of knowledge about Jesus, peace be upon him, say to them, “Come, let us bring our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then let us turn to God with supplication that He send down His punishment and curse upon those who lie in their words and persist in their stubbornness.”
m-0122	"This that I have informed you of regarding Jesus is the true news about which there is no doubt. And there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah alone. And indeed, Allah is the Exalted in Might in His Kingdom, the Wise in His Management and Action.

If they turn away from believing in you and following you, then they are the corrupters, and Allah is Knowing of them and will punish them for that.

Say, O Messenger, to the People of the Book, the Jews and the Christians: Come to a word of justice and truth that we all adhere to, which is that we single out Allah alone for worship and do not take any partner with Him from an idol or a statue or a cross or a tyrant or anything else, and that we do not owe obedience to one another instead of Allah. If they turn away from this good call, then say to them, O believers: Bear witness that we are Muslims, submissive to our Lord in servitude and sincerity. And the call to a just word, as was directed to the Jews and Christians, is directed to those who followed their path.

O people of the revealed books, the Jews and the Christians, how can each of you argue that Abraham, peace be upon him, was of his own religion, and the Torah and the Gospel were not sent down until after him? Do you not understand the error? Your saying that Abraham was a Jew or a Christian, and you know that Judaism and Christianity occurred after his death for a while. Here you are, O people, you have argued with the Messenger of God, Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, about what you have knowledge of regarding your religion, which you believe to be correct in your books. Why do you argue about what you have no knowledge of regarding Abraham? God knows all things in their hidden aspects, while you do not know. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, nor did Judaism nor Christianity occur except after him. Rather, he was a follower of God’s command and obedience, submitting to his Lord, and he was not of the polytheists. The people who have the most right to Abraham and the most special to him are those who believed in him, believed in his message, and followed him in his religion. This is the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and those who believed in him. God is the protector of those who believe in him and follow his law."
m-0123	A group of Jews and Christians wished to mislead you, O Muslims, from Islam. They only mislead themselves and their followers, and they do not know that nor do they understand it. O people of the Torah and the Gospel, why do you deny the verses of Allah that He sent down to His messengers in your books, in which Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is the awaited messenger and that what he brought to you is the truth, and you bear witness to that, but you deny it? O people of the Torah and the Gospel, why do you mix the truth in your books with what you have distorted and written of falsehood with your own hands, and hide what is in them of the description of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and that his religion is the truth, and you know that? A group of the People of the Book from among the Jews said, “Believe in what was sent down to those who believed at the beginning of the day and disbelieve at its end, perhaps they will doubt their religion and turn away from it.” And do not give true belief except to one who followed your religion and was a Jew. Say to them, O Messenger, that guidance and success are the guidance and success of Allah for the correct faith. They said, “Do not show what you have of knowledge to the Muslims, lest they learn from you and become equal to you in knowledge of it.” And they will have superiority over you or they will take it as an argument before your Lord by which they will overcome you. Say to them, O Messenger, that the grace and the giving and all matters are in the hand of God and under His control. He gives them to whomever He wills of those who believe in Him and His Messenger. And God is All-Encompassing and All-Knowing. He encompasses with His knowledge and giving all of His creatures who deserve His grace and blessings. Indeed, God chooses from among His creation whomever He wills for prophethood and guidance to the most perfect of laws, and God is the possessor of great grace.
m-0124	Among the People of the Book, among the Jews, are those who, if you entrust them with a great deal of wealth, will return it to you without betrayal. Among them are those who, if you entrust them with a single dinar, will not return it to you unless you make the utmost effort to demand it. The reason for this is a corrupt belief that makes them consider the wealth of the Arabs permissible unjustly and say, “There is no sin or blame upon us for consuming their wealth because Allah has made it permissible for us.” This is a lie against Allah that they say with their tongues, even though they know that they are lying. The matter is not as these liars claim, for the truly righteous is the one who fulfills his covenant with Allah by fulfilling the trust and believing in Him and His Messengers, adhering to His guidance and law, fearing Allah, the Almighty, and obeying His commands and refraining from what He has forbidden. Allah loves the righteous, who fear polytheism and sins. Indeed, those who exchange the covenant of Allah and His commandment that He enjoined in the Books that He revealed to their prophets for a lowly substitute and exchange of worldly goods and debris, they will have no share in the reward in the Hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them in a way that pleases them, nor will He look at them on the Day of Resurrection with an eye of mercy, nor will He purify them. Those who are filthy with sins and disbelief will have a painful punishment.
m-0125	And there are a group of Jews who distort the words from their contexts and change the words of Allah to make others think that this is from the revealed words, which is the Torah, when it is not from it at all. They say, “This is from Allah, Allah revealed it to His Prophet Moses,” when it is not from Allah. They, for the sake of their worldly life, tell lies about Allah, and they know that they are liars. It is not appropriate for any human being that Allah should send down His Book to him and make him a judge between His creation and choose him as a prophet, then say to the people, “Worship me instead of Allah.” Rather, he says, “Be wise, knowledgeable, and learned in what you taught others from the revelation of Allah, the Most High, and in what you study from it, by memorization, knowledge, and understanding.” And it is not for any of them to command you to take the angels and the prophets as lords to worship instead of Allah. Is it conceivable, O people, that he would command you to disbelieve in Allah after you have obeyed His command?
m-0126	And remember, O Messenger, when Allah, the Exalted, took the firm covenant from all the prophets: “If I give you a Book and wisdom, and then there comes to you a Messenger from Me confirming what is with you, you will believe in him and support him.” So have you acknowledged and acknowledged that and taken My firm covenant on that? They said: “We acknowledge that.” He said: “Then let some of you bear witness against others, and bear witness against your nations of that, and I am with you among the witnesses against you and against them.” In this, Allah took a covenant from every prophet to believe in Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and He took a covenant from the nations of the prophets of that. Whoever turns away from the call of Islam after this clarification and this covenant that Allah took from His prophets, then those are the ones who have gone beyond the religion of Allah and the obedience of their Lord. Do these wicked people of the Book want anything other than the religion of Allah, which is Islam, with which Allah sent Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, even though everyone in the heavens and the earth surrendered, submitted, and submitted to Allah willingly like the believers, and against their will during hardships when that will not benefit them, and they are the disbelievers, just as all the other creatures submitted to Him? And to Him they will return on the Day of Resurrection, and He will reward everyone. By his work, this is a warning from God Almighty to His creation that none of them should return to Him in a religion other than Islam.
m-0127	Say to them, O Messenger, we believe in God and obey Him, for we have no Lord other than Him, nor any deity other than Him, and we believe in the revelation that God sent down to us, and that which He sent down to Abraham, the friend of God, and his two sons, Ishmael and Isaac, and his grandson Jacob, son of Isaac, and that which He sent down to the tribes, who are the prophets who were in the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel, from the descendants of Jacob, and that which Moses and Jesus were given of the Torah and the Gospel, and that which God sent down to His prophets, we believe in all of that and do not differentiate between any of them, and we are obedient to God alone, acknowledging His Lordship, Divinity, and Worship. And whoever seeks a religion other than the religion of Islam, which is submission to God through monotheism and obedience to Him through obedience and servitude, and to His Messenger, the Seal of the Prophets, Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, through belief in him and following him and loving him outwardly and inwardly, that will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers who have deprived themselves of their portions.
m-0128	How can Allah guide to faith in Him and His Messenger a people who denied the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after they believed in him and testified that Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is the truth and what he brought is the truth and the proofs and evidences from Allah came to them for the truth and the right? Allah does not guide to the truth and the right path the oppressive group, who are those who turned away from the truth to falsehood and chose disbelief over faith. Those are the wrongdoers, their reward is that upon them is the curse of Allah, the angels, and all of mankind. They are banished from the mercy of Allah. They will abide in the Fire. The punishment will not be lifted from them for a little while so that they may rest, nor will it be delayed for them for an excuse they can offer. Except for those who return to their Lord with sincere repentance after their disbelief and injustice and correct what they have corrupted with their repentance, for Allah accepts it, for He is Forgiving of the sins of His servants, Merciful to them. Indeed, those who disbelieved after their belief and continued in disbelief until death, their repentance will not be accepted when death approaches. And those are the ones who have gone astray from the path and erred in its way. Indeed, those who denied the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, Allah's peace and blessings be upon him, and they died in disbelief in Allah and His Messenger. On the Day of Resurrection, no one will be accepted from him a full earth of gold to ransom himself from the punishment of Allah, even if he actually ransomed himself with it. Those will have a painful punishment, and they will have no one to save them from the punishment of Allah.
m-0129	You will not attain Paradise until you give in charity from what you love, and whatever you give in charity, no matter how little or much, Allah knows it and will reward every spender according to his deeds. All good foods were lawful for the sons of Jacob, peace be upon him, except what Jacob forbade himself due to an illness that befell him, and that was before the Torah was revealed. When the Torah was revealed, Allah forbade the Children of Israel some foods that were lawful for them, due to their injustice and transgression. Say to them, O Messenger, bring the Torah and read what is in it, if you are right in your claim that Allah revealed in it the prohibition of what Jacob forbade himself, so that you may know the truth of what came in the Qur’an, that Allah did not forbid the Children of Israel anything before the Torah was revealed, except what Jacob forbade himself. Whoever lies about Allah after reading the Torah and the clarity of the truth, then those are the wrongdoers who speak falsehood about Allah.
m-0130	Tell them, O Messenger, that Allah has spoken the truth in what He has informed us and in what He has prescribed. If you are truthful in your love and affiliation with the friend of Allah, Abraham, peace be upon him, then follow his religion that Allah has prescribed through the tongue of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for it is the truth about which there is no doubt. Abraham, peace be upon him, was not among those who associated partners with Allah in His Oneness and worship of Him. The first house built for the worship of Allah on earth is the Sacred House of Allah in Mecca. This house is blessed, in which good deeds are multiplied and mercy descends. In facing it in prayer and intending to perform Hajj and Umrah, there is righteousness and guidance for all people. In this house there are clear indications that it was built by Abraham and that Allah has made it great and honored, including the Station of Abraham, peace be upon him, which is the stone on which he and his son Ishmael stood when he was raising the foundations of the house. Whoever enters this house is safe for himself and no one will harm him. Allah has made it obligatory for those who are able from among the people, wherever they are, to intend to perform the rituals of Hajj. Whoever denies the obligation of Hajj has disbelieved, and Allah is independent of him, his Hajj and his deeds, and all of His creation.
m-0131	Say, O Messenger, to the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians, why do you deny the proofs of Allah that indicate that the religion of Allah is Islam and deny what is in their books of evidence and proofs of that while you know, and Allah is witness to your actions? In that is a threat and warning to them. Say, O Messenger, to the Jews and Christians, why do you prevent from Islam those who want to enter it, seeking for them deviation and deviation from the path and righteousness while you know that what you have brought is the truth, and Allah is not unaware of what you do and will reward you for that. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if you obey a group of Jews and Christians from those to whom Allah has given the Torah and the Gospel, they will mislead you and cast doubt upon you in your religion so that you will return to denying the truth after you were believers in it. So do not trust them with regard to your religion and do not accept their opinion or advice. How can you disbelieve in Allah, O believers, while the verses of the Qur’an are recited to you and among you is the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who conveys them to you? And whoever relies upon Allah and adheres to the Qur’an and the Sunnah has been guided to the right path. Clear and straight forward approach
m-0132	"O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, fear Allah as He should be feared, that is, by obeying Him and not disobeying Him, thanking Him and not ungrateful, remembering Him and not forgetting Him, and persist in your adherence to your Islam until the end of your life so that you may meet Allah while you are upon it. And hold fast all together to the Book of your Lord and the guidance of your Prophet, and do not do what leads to your division, and remember the great blessing that Allah bestowed upon you, when you, O believers, were enemies before Islam, then Allah united your hearts in love for Him and love for His Messenger, and He placed in your hearts the love of one another, so that by His grace you became loving brothers. And you were on the edge of the fire of Hell, then Allah guided you with Islam and saved you from the fire. And just as Allah showed you the signs of true faith, so He shows you everything that is good for you so that you may be guided to the path of righteousness and follow it, and do not go astray from it. And let there be from you, O believers, a group that calls to goodness and enjoins what is right, which is what is known to be good by the law and reason, and forbids what is wrong, which is what is known to be ugly by the law and reason. And those are the winners of the Gardens of Delight.

And do not be, O believers, like the People of the Book, among whom enmity and hatred arose, so they split into sects and parties and differed concerning the principles of their religion after the truth had become clear to them. And those are the ones who deserve a great and painful punishment.

On the Day of Resurrection, the faces of the people of happiness who believed in Allah and His Messenger and obeyed His command will be whitened, and the faces of the people of misery who denied His Messenger and disobeyed His command will be blackened. As for those whose faces will be blackened, it will be said to them in rebuke, “Did you disbelieve after your belief, choosing disbelief over belief? So taste the punishment because of your disbelief.”

As for those whose faces will be whitened with the radiance of bliss and the good news they were given, they will be in Allah’s Paradise and its delights, and they will remain therein, never leaving it.

These are the verses of Allah and His shining proofs, which We recite and relate to you, O Messenger, with truth and certainty. Allah is not unjust to any of His creation, nor will He diminish anything from their deeds, for He is the Just Ruler who does not transgress.

To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. His is the sole property, creation and management, and the destiny of all creation. To Him alone, He rewards each according to his merit."
m-0133	You, O nation of Muhammad, are the best of nations and the most beneficial of people to people. You enjoin what is right, which is what is known to be good according to the Shariah and reason, and you forbid what is wrong, which is what is known to be ugly according to the Shariah and reason. You believe in Allah with a firm belief supported by action. If the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians, had believed in Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and what he brought to them from Allah, as you have believed, it would have been better for them in this world and the Hereafter. Among them are the believers who believe in the message of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and act upon it, and they are few, and most of them are those who have deviated from the religion of Allah and His obedience. These wicked people of the Book will not harm you except what hurts your ears from the words of polytheism and disbelief and other things. If they fight you, they will be defeated and flee, turning their backs, and they will not be victorious over you in any case. Allah has made humiliation and degradation an indispensable matter that does not leave the Jews. They are humiliated and despised wherever they are found except by a covenant from Allah and a covenant from the people by which they are safe for themselves and their wealth. This is the covenant of protection for them and the obligation of the rulings of Islam. They returned with the wrath of Allah, deserving it, and punishment was imposed upon them. Humiliation and poverty, so you do not see the Jew except that he is afraid and terrified of the people of faith, that is what God has imposed on them because of their disbelief in God and their transgression of His limits and their killing of the prophets unjustly and aggressively. What made them do this is their committing sins and transgressing the limits of God. The People of the Book are not equal. Among them is a group that is upright in the command of God, believing in His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. They stand at night reciting the verses of the Noble Qur’an, turning to communing with God in their prayers. They believe in God and the Last Day, and they enjoin all good and forbid all evil, and they hasten to do good deeds. They are among the righteous servants of God. Any good deed, whether small or large, that this group of believers does will not be lost with God, but they will be thanked and rewarded for it. God is All-Knowing of the righteous who do good deeds and stay away from forbidden things, seeking the pleasure of God and seeking His reward.
m-0134	Indeed, those who disbelieve in the signs of Allah and deny His messengers - neither their wealth nor their children will protect them from the punishment of Allah in this world or in the Hereafter. And those are the companions of the Fire, abiding therein; they will never emerge from it. The example of what the disbelievers spend in the ways of goodness in this worldly life and what they hope for as reward is like the example of a wind containing severe cold that blows upon the crops of a people who were hoping for good from it. But because of their sins, the wind leaves nothing of it. And these disbelievers will not find in the Hereafter any reward. And Allah has not wronged them in that, but they have wronged themselves by their disbelief and disobedience.
m-0135	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers, revealing your secrets to them. These people never stop corrupting your situation, and they rejoice at the harm and misfortune that befalls you. The intensity of hatred has become apparent in their speech, and what their hearts conceal of enmity toward you is greater and more serious. We have shown you the proofs and arguments so that you may learn a lesson and beware, if you understand the admonitions, commands, and prohibitions of Allah. Here is the evidence of your error in loving them. You love them and treat them well, but they do not love you and they bear enmity and hatred toward you. You believe in all the revealed books, including their book, and they do not believe in your book. So how can you love them? When they meet you, they say hypocritically, “We believe and we believe,” but when they are alone with one another, grief and sadness appear on them, and they bite the tips of their fingers out of intense anger at what they see of the Muslims’ unity and their unification, and the honor and humiliation of Islam by it. Say to them, O Messenger, “Die with the intensity of your anger. Indeed, Allah is aware of what the hearts conceal.” And He will reward each one for what he has done of good or evil. And from the enmity of these people is that, O believers, if something good befalls you, such as victory or spoils, they appear to be sad and grieved. But if something bad befalls you, such as defeat or loss of wealth, lives and fruits, they rejoice in that. But if you are patient over what befalls you and fear God in what He has commanded you and what He has forbidden you, the harm of their plot will not harm you. And God encompasses all that these disbelievers do of corruption, and He will reward them for that.
m-0136	"And remember, O Messenger, when you went out from your house wearing war gear, organizing the ranks of your companions and descending each one to his home to meet the polytheists in the Battle of Uhud. And God is Hearing of your words and Knowing of your actions.

Remember, O Messenger, what happened with Banu Salamah and Banu Haritha when they thought of returning with their leader, the hypocrite Abdullah bin Ubayy, fearing meeting the enemy, but God protected and preserved them, so they marched with you, trusting in God, and in God alone let the believers put their trust.

And God, O believers, gave you victory at Badr over your polytheist enemies, despite your small number and your numbers, so fear God by doing what He commands and avoiding what He prohibits, so that you may be grateful to Him for His blessings.

Remember, O Messenger, what happened with your companions at Badr when it was difficult for them to have reinforcements for the polytheists come, so We inspired you to say to them, “Will not the help of your Lord suffice you by supporting you with three thousand angels sent down from the sky to the battlefield to strengthen you and fight with you?”

Yes, this reinforcement is sufficient for you, and there is another good news for you if you are patient in meeting the enemy. And fear Allah by doing what He has commanded you to do and avoiding what He has forbidden you to do. And the disbelievers of Mecca will come immediately, rushing to fight you, thinking that they will eradicate you. Then Allah will reinforce you with five thousand angels with clear marks, meaning that they have made themselves and their horses known with clear marks. And Allah has not made this reinforcement of angels except as good news for you, giving you good news and so that your hearts may be reassured and be pleased with Allah’s promise to you. And victory comes only from Allah, the Almighty, who cannot be overcome, the Wise in His planning and action. And Allah’s victory for you at Badr was to destroy a group of disbelievers by killing. And whoever of them escaped from killing returned sad, his soul distressed, and shame and disgrace appeared on him. You, O Messenger, have no part in the matter of the servants, rather the matter is entirely up to Allah, the Most High, alone, with no partner. Perhaps some of those who fought you will have their hearts opened to Islam and submit, so Allah will accept their repentance. And whoever remains in his disbelief, Allah will punish him in this world and the hereafter because of his injustice and oppression. And to Allah alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. He forgives whomever He wills of His servants by His mercy and punishes whomever He wills by His justice. And Allah Forgiving of the sins of His servants, Merciful to them"
m-0137	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, beware of usury in all its forms and do not take on a loan an increase over your capital, even if it is little, so how much more if this increase is doubled every time the time comes to repay the debt. And fear Allah by adhering to His law so that you may succeed in this world and the Hereafter. Make for yourselves a shield between you and the Fire which has been prepared for the disbelievers. And obey Allah, O believers, in what He has commanded you of acts of obedience and in what He has forbidden you of consuming usury and other things. And obey the Messenger so that you may receive mercy and not be punished.
m-0138	"And hasten to obey Allah and His Messenger to seize the great forgiveness from your Lord and a spacious Paradise as wide as the heavens and the earth, prepared by Allah for the righteous

Those who spend their wealth in ease and hardship and who hold back what is in their souls of anger with patience and when they are able, pardon those who wrong them. This is the goodness that Allah loves its companions

And those who, when they commit a great sin or wrong themselves by committing something less than that, remember the promise of Allah and His threat and turn to their Lord in repentance, asking Him to forgive them their sins, and they are certain that no one forgives sins except Allah. Therefore, they do not persist in disobedience, and they know that if they repent, Allah will accept their repentance

Those described with these great qualities, their reward is that Allah will cover their sins, and for them are gardens beneath whose trees and palaces flow fresh water, abiding therein forever, never to emerge from it. And excellent is the reward of the workers, forgiveness and Paradise"
m-0139	Allah addresses the believers when they were afflicted on the Day of Uhud, consoling them that there have passed before you nations whose believers were tested by fighting the disbelievers, and the end result was theirs. So travel through the land, taking heed of what happened to those who denied Allah and His Messengers. This Qur’an is a statement and guidance to the path of truth and a reminder that humbles the hearts of the righteous, and they are those who fear Allah and are singled out for this because they are the ones who benefit from it, not others. And do not weaken, O believers, in fighting your enemy, and do not grieve over what has befallen you at Uhud, for you are the victors, and the end result is yours if you believe in Allah and His Messenger and follow His law. If you, O believers, are afflicted with wounds or killed in the Battle of Uhud and you are saddened by that, then the polytheists were afflicted with wounds and killed in the Battle of Badr. And Allah alternates these days among the people, sometimes victory and other defeats, because of the wisdom in that, until He reveals what Allah knew from eternity, so that Allah may distinguish the true believer from others and honor some of you with martyrdom. And Allah does not love those who wrong themselves and sit back from fighting in His cause. And this defeat that It occurred in Uhud, it was a test and purification for the believers and a deliverance for them from the hypocrites and a destruction for the disbelievers. O companions of Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, did you think that you would enter Paradise without being tested with fighting and hardships? You will not be able to enter it until you are tested and Allah knows clearly for the creation of those among you who strive in His cause and are patient in resisting the enemies. Before the Battle of Uhud, you, O believers, were wishing to meet the enemy in order to attain the honor of jihad and martyrdom in the cause of Allah, which your brothers were granted in the Battle of Badr. So here you are, what you wished for and sought has come to you, so fight and be patient. Muhammad is only a messenger from the same kind of messengers who came before him, conveying the message of his Lord. If he dies at the end of his life or is killed, as the enemies spread, will you turn back from your religion and abandon what your Prophet brought you? And whoever among you turns back from his religion will not harm Allah at all; he only harms himself greatly. As for the one who remains steadfast in faith and thanks his Lord for the blessing of Islam, Allah will reward him with the best reward.
m-0140	"No one will die except by Allah's permission and decree, and until he completes the period that Allah has decreed for him, a deferred book. And whoever seeks by his work the worldly gain, We will give him what We have allotted for him of provision, but he has no share in the Hereafter. And whoever seeks by his work the reward from Allah in the Hereafter, We will grant him what he has asked for and give him his reward abundantly along with what he has in this world of provision that has been allotted. So he has thanked Us through his obedience and his struggle, and We will reward the grateful with good. Many of the previous prophets fought with large groups of their companions, and they did not weaken when they were wounded or killed, because that was for the sake of their Lord. They did not become weak or submit to their enemy, but they were patient with what befell them, and Allah loves the patient. And the only saying of these patient ones was that they said, ""Our Lord, forgive us our sins and what we have transgressed in the matter of our religion, and make firm our feet so that we do not flee from fighting our enemy, and give us victory over those who denied Your Oneness and the prophethood of Your prophets."" So Allah gave those patient ones their reward in this world with victory over their enemies and empowerment on earth and the great good reward in the Hereafter, which is Gardens. Bliss and God loves everyone who worships his Lord well and treats His creation well."
m-0141	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if you obey those who have denied My divinity and do not believe in My messengers from among the Jews and Christians and the hypocrites and the polytheists in what they command you and forbid you, they will mislead you from the path of truth and you will turn back from your religion and then you will return to clear loss and certain destruction. They will not help you. Rather, Allah is your helper, and He is the best helper. He does not need anyone’s help with Him. We will cast into the hearts of those who disbelieve the most intense terror and fear because of their associating with Allah alleged gods for whom they have no proof or evidence that they are worthy of worship along with Allah. Their condition in this world is terror and panic from the believers, but their place in the Hereafter to which they will resort is the Fire because of their injustice and aggression. What an evil place this is for them.
m-0142	And Allah has fulfilled for you what He promised you of victory when you were killing the infidels in the Battle of Uhud by His permission, until when you became cowardly and weak in fighting and differed as to whether you would remain in your positions or leave them to collect the spoils with whoever collects them, and you disobeyed the command of your Messenger when he commanded you not to leave your positions in any case, defeat befell you after He showed you what you love of victory and it became clear that among you are those who want the spoils and that among you are those who seek the Hereafter and its reward. Then Allah turned your faces away from your enemy to test you, and Allah knew your regret and repentance, so He forgave you, and Allah is possessed of great bounty upon the believers. Remember, O companions of Muhammad, what happened to you when you began to climb the mountain fleeing from your enemies and did not pay attention to anyone because of the astonishment, fear and terror that overcame you, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was standing in the field calling to you from behind you, saying, “To me, servants of Allah,” and you neither heard nor looked. So your reward was that Allah sent down upon you pain, distress and grief so that you would not grieve over the victory that had eluded you. And the spoils, nor what has befallen you of fear and defeat, and God is All-Knowing of all your deeds, nothing of them is hidden from Him. Then it was from the mercy of God to the sincere believers that He cast into their hearts, after what had befallen them of worry and grief, reassurance and trust in the promise of God. And from its effect was drowsiness that overcame a group of them, and they were the people of sincerity and certainty, and another group, whose concern was their own salvation in particular, and their resolve weakened and they were preoccupied with themselves and they thought badly of their Lord and His religion and His Prophet and they thought that God would not complete the matter of His Messenger and that Islam would not be established. Therefore, you see them regretting their departure, saying to each other, “Did we have a choice in going out to fight?” Say to them, O Messenger, that the matter is all God’s, for He is the One who has decreed your departure and what has happened to you, and they hide within themselves what they do not show you of regret for going out to fight, saying, “If we had the slightest choice, we would not have been killed here.” Say to them, “The appointed times are in God’s hand, and if you had been in your homes and God had decreed that you should die, those upon whom God had decreed death would have gone out to where they would be killed.” And God did not do that except to test what was in your hearts of doubt and hypocrisy. And to distinguish the wicked from the good, and to make the matter of the believer clear to the people in words and deeds. And God is Knowing of what is in the hearts of His creation. Nothing of their affairs is hidden from Him. Indeed, those of you who fled from the fighting, O companions of Muhammad, on the day when the believers and the polytheists met in the Battle of Uhud, Satan caused them to fall into this sin because of some of the sins they had committed. And God has overlooked them and has not punished them. Indeed, God is Forgiving to the sinners who repent, Forbearing. He does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him.
m-0143	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not resemble the disbelievers who do not believe in their Lord. They say to their brothers among the disbelievers when they go out to search for their livelihood in Allah’s land or were with the fighting invaders and died or were killed, “If these people had not gone out and not fought and had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed.” This statement increases their pain, grief, and regret that settles in their hearts. As for the believers, they know that this is by Allah’s decree, so Allah guides their hearts and lightens the calamity for them. Allah gives life to whomever He has decreed to live, even if he is a traveler or a fighter, and He causes to die whomever his term has come to an end, even if he is a resident. Allah is Seeing of all that you do and will reward you for it. And if you are killed, O believers, while you are fighting in the cause of Allah or die during the fighting, Allah will surely forgive you your sins and will have mercy upon you with mercy from Him, and you will attain the Gardens of Delight. That is better than this world and what its people accumulate. And if your terms have expired in this worldly life and you die in your beds or are killed on the battlefield, then to Allah alone is the recompense. You will be gathered and He will reward you for your deeds.
m-0144	By the mercy of Allah upon you and your companions, O Prophet, Allah has bestowed His favor upon you, so you were kind to them. If you had been ill-tempered and hard-hearted, your companions would have turned away from you. So do not hold them accountable for what they did in the Battle of Uhud. Ask Allah, O Prophet, to forgive them and consult them in matters that require consultation. If you decide on a matter after consulting, then carry it out, relying on Allah alone. Indeed, Allah loves those who put their trust in Him. If Allah extends His victory and support to you, no one can defeat you. But if He forsakes you, who is it that can give you victory after He forsakes you? And in Allah alone let the believers put their trust.
m-0145	It is not for a prophet to betray his companions by taking anything from the spoils other than what Allah has specified for him. And whoever does that among you will bring what he has taken, carrying it on the Day of Resurrection to disgrace him in the witnessed place. Then every soul will be given the full recompense for what it earned, without injustice. Not equal are those whose intention is to please Allah and those who are bent on sins, displeasing their Lord, and thus deserve to dwell in Hell - and wretched is that destination. The companions of Paradise, who follow what pleases Allah, will differ in degrees, and the companions of Hell, who follow what displeases Allah, will differ in levels. They will not be equal, and Allah is Seeing of their deeds; nothing of them is hidden from Him.
m-0146	Allah bestowed His favor upon the believing Arabs when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves who recites to them the verses of the Qur’an and purifies them from polytheism and corrupt morals and teaches them the Qur’an and the Sunnah, although before this Messenger they were in manifest error and ignorance. Did not a calamity befall you, O believers, when it befell you on the Day of Uhud, and you befell the polytheists twice as much on the Day of Badr, and you said in astonishment, “How can this be while we are Muslims and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is among us, and these are polytheists?” Say to them, O Prophet, “This that has befallen you is from yourselves because of your disobedience to the command of your Messenger and your eagerness to collect spoils. Indeed, Allah does what He wills and decrees what He wills. There is no one who can reverse His decree.”
m-0147	And whatever wounds or killings befell you in the Battle of Uhud, the day when the believers and the polytheists met, and victory was for the believers first, then for the polytheists second, all of that is by the decree and predestination of Allah, and to make manifest what Allah knew in eternity, to distinguish the true believers from among you. And to know the hypocrites, whose hearts Allah revealed when the believers said to them, “Come, fight with us in the cause of Allah,” or “Be an aid to us by increasing our numbers.” But they said, “If we had known that you were fighting anyone, we would have been with you.” They are closer to disbelief on this day than to faith, because they say with their mouths what is not in their hearts, and Allah knows best what they conceal in their breasts. These hypocrites are the ones who sat back and said to their brothers who were wounded with the Muslims in their war against the polytheists on the Day of Uhud, “If these people had obeyed us, they would not have been killed.” Say to them, O Messenger, “Then ward off death from yourselves, if you are truthful in your claim that if they had obeyed you, they would not have been killed, and that you have escaped from it by sitting back from the fighting.”
m-0148	And do not think, O Prophet, that those who were killed in the way of Allah are dead and do not feel anything. Rather, they are alive in an intermediate life in the company of their Lord, for whose sake they fought and died in His way. Their provision is provided for them in Paradise and they enjoy. Happiness has overwhelmed them when Allah bestowed His favor upon them and gave them from His great goodness and vast generosity of bliss and contentment that would comfort their eyes. They rejoice over their struggling brothers who left them while they were alive, so that they may win as they won, knowing that they will attain the good that they attained if they were martyred in the way of Allah, sincerely for Him, and that they have no fear in the affairs of the Hereafter, nor do they grieve over what they have missed of worldly fortunes. They are in overwhelming joy for what they have been given of Allah’s blessings and abundant giving, and that Allah does not waste the reward of those who believe in Him, but rather increases it and increases it from His grace. Those who responded to the call of Allah and His Messenger and went out in the wake of the polytheists to Hamra al-Asad after their defeat in the Battle of Uhud, despite the pain and wounds they had suffered. And they exerted their utmost effort and adhered to the guidance of their Prophet. For the righteous and pious among them, there is a great reward. They are the ones to whom some of the polytheists said that Abu Sufyan and those with him had decided to return to you to exterminate you, so beware of them and avoid meeting them, for you will not be able to defeat them. This intimidation increased their certainty and belief in Allah’s promise to them, but it did not deter them from their resolve. They went to wherever Allah willed and said, “Allah is sufficient for us,” meaning, “He is sufficient for us.” And He is the best Disposer of affairs, entrusted with the management of His servants. So they returned from Hamra’ al-Asad to Medina with the blessing of Allah, with the great reward and with His favor, with the high status. They increased in faith and certainty, and they humiliated the enemies of Allah and were granted safety from killing and fighting. They sought the pleasure of Allah by obeying Him and His Messenger, and Allah is the possessor of great favor upon them and others. The only thing that discourages you in this is Satan, who came to you to frighten you with his supporters, so do not fear the polytheists because they are weak and have no supporter. Fear Me by turning to My obedience if you believe in Me and follow My Messenger.
m-0149	"Let not sadness enter your heart, O Messenger, for these disbelievers, with their haste in denial and misguidance, will not harm Allah, but they will harm themselves by depriving them of the sweetness of faith and the great reward. Allah does not want to give them any reward in the Hereafter because they turned away from the call to truth, and for them is a severe punishment.

Indeed, those who exchanged disbelief for faith will not harm Allah at all, but the harm of their actions will return to themselves, and for them in the Hereafter is a painful punishment.

And let not the deniers think that if We prolong their lives and grant them enjoyment of the pleasures of this world and do not punish them for their disbelief and sins, that they have thereby attained any good for themselves. We only delay their punishment and their appointed times so that they may increase in injustice and transgression, and for them is a punishment that will humiliate and degrade them.

Allah would not leave you, O believers in Allah and His Messenger, who act according to His law, as you are, confusing the believer among you with the hypocrite, until He distinguishes the wicked from the good, and distinguishes the hypocrite from the true believer. And it was not from the wisdom of Allah to inform you, O believers, of the unseen that He knows of His servants. So you will know the believer among them from the hypocrite, but He distinguishes them by trials and tribulations. However, Allah Almighty chooses from among His messengers whomever He wills to inform him of some of the knowledge of the unseen by revelation from Him. So believe in Allah and His Messenger. And if you believe with true faith and fear your Lord by obeying Him, then for you is a great reward with Allah. And let not those who are stingy with what Allah has bestowed upon them out of His favor think that this stinginess is good for them. Rather, it is bad for them, because this money that they have accumulated will be a collar of fire that will be placed around their necks on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah, the Almighty, is the Owner of the Kingdom and He is the Eternal after the annihilation of all His creation. He is All-Knowing of all your deeds and He will reward each one according to his due."
m-0150	Allah has heard the statement of the Jews who said that Allah is poor towards us and asks us to lend him money while we are rich. We will write down this statement that they said and we will write that they were satisfied with what happened from their fathers killing the prophets of Allah unjustly and aggressively and we will hold them accountable for that in the Hereafter and we will say to them while they are being tortured in the Fire, “Taste the torment of the burning Fire.” This severe torment is because of what you have presented in your worldly life of verbal, practical and doctrinal sins and that Allah is not unjust to His servants. These Jews, when they were called to Islam, said that Allah commanded us in the Torah not to believe anyone who came to us saying that he is a messenger from Allah until he brings us charity to draw closer to Allah, then fire descends from the sky and burns it. Say to them, O Messenger, you are lying in your statement because messengers came to your fathers before me with miracles and evidence of their truthfulness and with what you said about bringing the sacrifice that the fire consumes. So why did your fathers kill these prophets if you are truthful in your claim? If these Jews and others from the disbelievers have lied to you, O Messenger, then the falsifiers have lied a lot. Of the messengers before you, there came to their people dazzling miracles, clear arguments, and heavenly books that are a light that dispels darkness and a clear and evident book.
m-0151	Every soul must taste death, and with this, all creation will return to their Lord to be held accountable. You will only be given your full rewards for your deeds on the Day of Resurrection, without any deficiency. So whoever is honored by his Lord and saved from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained the ultimate goal of what he seeks. And the life of this world is nothing but a fleeting pleasure, so do not be deceived by it. You, O believers, will be tested in your wealth by paying the obligatory and recommended expenditures, and by the calamities that befall it, and in yourselves by what is obligatory upon you of acts of obedience and what befalls you of wounds, killing, and loss of loved ones. This is so that the true believer will be distinguished from others. And you will hear from the Jews, Christians, and polytheists what will hurt your ears of words of polytheism and slander of your religion. And if you, O believers, are patient with all of this and fear Allah by adhering to His obedience and avoiding His disobedience, then this is one of the matters that one must resolve to do and compete in.
m-0152	And remember, O Messenger, when Allah took a firm covenant from those to whom Allah had given the Scripture, from among the Jews and the Christians. So for the Jews was the Torah and for the Christians was the Gospel, that they should act according to them and make clear to the people what is in them and not conceal that or hide it. But they abandoned the covenant and did not abide by it, and they took a small price in exchange for concealing the truth and distorting the Scripture. What an evil purchase they are buying for their neglect of the covenant and their alteration of the Scripture. And do not think that those who rejoice in what they have done of ugly deeds, such as the Jews and the hypocrites and others, and love that people should praise them for what they have not done, do not think that they are safe from the punishment of Allah in this world, for they will have a painful punishment in the Hereafter. And in the verse is a severe warning for everyone who does an evil deed, admiring it, and for everyone who boasts about what he has not done so that people may praise him and thank him. And to Allah alone is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them, and Allah is over all things competent.
m-0153	"Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth without a previous example, and in the succession of night and day and their differences in length and shortness, there are great proofs and evidences of the Oneness of God for those with sound minds

Those who remember God in all their states, standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and they contemplate the creation of the heavens and the earth, saying, “O our Lord, You did not create this creation in vain, for You are far removed from that, so avert from us the punishment of the Fire.”

O our Lord, save us from the Fire, for whoever You admit into the Fire because of his sins, You have disgraced and humiliated him, and the sinners who wrong themselves have no one to protect them from the punishment of God on the Day of Resurrection.

O our Lord, we have heard a caller, who is Your Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, calling on the people to believe in You, acknowledge Your Oneness, and act according to Your Law, so we responded to his call and believed in his message, so forgive us our sins, cover our faults, and join us with the righteous.

O our Lord, give us what You promised us through the tongues of Your Messengers of victory, empowerment, success, and guidance, and do not disgrace us because of our sins on the Day of Resurrection. So you are generous and do not break a promise that you have promised to your servants. So God answered their prayer that He would not waste the effort of anyone who did a good deed among them, whether male or female, and they are in brotherhood in religion and the acceptance of deeds and the reward for them are equal. So those who emigrated out of desire to please God Almighty and were expelled from their homes and were harmed in obedience to their Lord and worship of Him and fought and were killed in the way of God to make His word supreme, God will conceal from them what they committed of sins as He concealed them in this world, so He will not hold them accountable for them and He will admit them to gardens beneath whose palaces and trees rivers flow as a reward from God, and God has with Him the best reward."
m-0154	Do not be deceived, O Messenger, by the ease of life and abundance of provision that the disbelievers enjoy, and their moving from place to place for trade and seeking profits and money. Soon all of this will be gone from them and they will become mortgaged to their evil deeds. A brief, fleeting pleasure. Then their destiny on the Day of Resurrection will be the Fire, and what an evil resting place that is. But those who feared their Lord, obeyed His commands, and avoided His prohibitions, Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow. This is their permanent home from which they will not leave. And what Allah has prepared is greater and better for the obedient than what the disbelievers reside in of the pleasures of this world.
m-0155	And indeed, some of the People of the Scripture believe in Allah as one Lord and God to be worshipped, and in what has been revealed to you of this Qur’an and what has been revealed to them of the Torah and the Gospel, humbling themselves to Allah and submitting to Him. They do not exchange the verses of Allah for a small price from the debris of this world, nor do they conceal what Allah has revealed or distort it, like other People of the Scripture. Those will have a great reward with Him on the Day they meet Him, and He will pay it back to them without any reduction. Indeed, Allah is swift in account. The reckoning of their deeds and their calling to account for them is not incapable of Him. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, be patient in obeying your Lord and in whatever harm and calamity befalls you, and be patient with your enemies until they are not more patient than you, and persist in jihad against My enemy and your enemy, and fear Allah in all your circumstances, hoping that you will win His pleasure in this world and the Hereafter.
m-0156	O people, fear God, adhere to His commands and avoid His prohibitions. He is the One who created you from a single soul, Adam, peace be upon him, and created from it its mate, Eve, and from them spread throughout the earth many men and many women. And be mindful of God, through whom you will ask one another, and beware of severing your ties of kinship. Indeed, God is watching all your affairs.
m-0157	"And give to those whose fathers have died before they reached the age of puberty, and you were their guardians, their property if they reached the age of puberty and you saw in them the ability to preserve their property. And do not take the best of their property and replace it with the bad of your property, and do not mix their property with your property in order to use it as a trick to eat their property. Indeed, whoever dares to do that has committed a great sin. And if you fear that you will not be just towards the orphan women under your care, by not giving them their dowries like others, then leave them and marry such women as please you from other than them, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just between them, then be content with one or with what you have of female slaves. That is what I have prescribed for you regarding orphan girls. And marrying from one to four, or limiting one to one, or possessing the right hand, is closer to avoiding injustice and transgression. And give the women their dowries as a mandatory gift and a binding obligation, willingly from you. But if they give you something of the dowry, and they give it to you, then take it and dispose of it, for it is lawful.

O guardians, do not give to those men, women and children who squander their wealth that is in your hands, spending it in other than its proper place. This wealth is what sustains people’s lives. Spend on them from it, clothe them and speak to them kind words of good speech and good manners. 

And test those orphans under your hands to know their ability to manage their wealth well. When they reach the age of puberty and you know that they are righteous in their religion and able to preserve their wealth, then hand it over to them and do not transgress against it by spending it in other than its proper place, extravagantly and rushing to eat it before they take it from you. And whoever among you has wealth, let him be chaste in his wealth and not take anything from the orphan’s wealth. And whoever is poor, let him take according to his need in case of necessity. So if you know that they are able to preserve their wealth after they reach puberty and you hand it over to them, then have witnesses over them to ensure that their right reaches them in full so that they do not deny it. And it is sufficient for you that Allah is a witness over you and will hold you accountable for what you have done."
m-0158	"For males, young or old, there is a share prescribed by Allah in what the parents and close relatives leave behind, whether it is little or much, in clear and specific shares that Allah has imposed for them, and for women as well.

If the relatives of the deceased who have no right to the estate are present at the division of the inheritance, or those whose fathers died while they were young, or those who have no money are present, then give them some of the money as a recommended measure before dividing the estate among its owners, and speak to them in a good manner, not indecent or ugly.

And let those fear that if they died and left behind them young, weak children, they would fear injustice and loss for them. Let them fear Allah with regard to those under their care, whether orphans or others, by protecting their money, raising them well, and repelling harm from them. Let them speak to them in a manner that is in accordance with justice and what is right.

Indeed, those who transgress against the property of orphans, taking it unjustly, are only consuming fire that is blazing within their bellies on the Day of Resurrection, and they will enter a Fire whose heat they will suffer."
m-0159	Allah instructs you and commands you concerning your children: if one of you dies and leaves behind both male and female children, then his entire inheritance is for them. The male gets the share of two females if there is no other heir. If he leaves behind only daughters, then two or more daughters get two-thirds of what he left. If there is only one daughter, then she gets half. The parents of the deceased get one-sixth each if he has a son, male or female, one or more. If he has no son and his parents inherit him, then his mother gets one-third and his father gets the remainder. If the deceased has two or more brothers, male or female, then his mother gets one-sixth and his father gets the remainder. The brothers get nothing. This division of the estate is only to be done after the deceased’s will is made within the limits of one-third or after paying what he owes of the debts of your fathers and children to whom the inheritance is prescribed. You do not know which of them is closer to you in benefit in this world and the hereafter, so do not prefer one of them over the other. This that I have instructed you is imposed upon you by Allah. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of His creation, Wise in what He has prescribed for them. And for you, O men, is half of what your wives leave after their death if they do not have children. If they have a child, whether male or female, then for you is a fourth of what they leave behind, after carrying out their valid bequests or whatever debts they may have, for those who are entitled to it. And for your husbands, O men, a fourth of what you leave behind if you have no son or daughter from them or from others. But if you have a son or a daughter, then for them is an eighth of what you leave behind, the fourth or eighth to be divided among them. If there is only one wife, this is her inheritance after carrying out whatever you have bequeathed of valid bequests or paying off whatever debts you may have. And if a man or a woman dies and has no child or father and has a brother or sister from the mother, then for each one of them is a sixth. If the brothers or sisters from the mother are more than that, then they are partners in the third, which is divided equally among them, with no difference between males and females. This is what God has ordained for the brothers and sisters from the mother, they take it as an inheritance for them after paying off the debts of the deceased and carrying out his bequest, if he has bequeathed something that does not harm the heirs. With this your Lord has enjoined upon you a beneficial bequest for you, and God is Knowing of what is good for His creation, Forbearing. He does not hasten to punish them.
m-0160	"And for you, O men, is half of what your wives leave after their death if they have no child, male or female. But if they have a child, then for you is a quarter of what they leave, which you inherit after carrying out their valid bequests or whatever debts they may have, to those who are entitled to it. And for your husbands, O men, is a quarter of what you leave if you have no son or daughter from them or from others. But if you have a son or a daughter, then for them is an eighth of what you leave, the quarter or the eighth is divided among them. If there is only one wife, this is her inheritance after carrying out whatever you have bequeathed of valid bequests or paying off whatever debts you may have. And if a man or a woman dies and has no child or father and has a brother or sister from the mother, then for each of them is a sixth. But if the brothers or sisters from the mother are more than that, then they are partners in the third, which is divided among them equally, with no difference between males and females. This is what God has ordained for the brothers and sisters from the mother, so they take it as an inheritance for them after paying off the debts of the deceased and carrying out his bequest if he has bequeathed something that does not harm the heirs. With this your Lord has enjoined upon you a beneficial bequest for you, and God is Knowing of what is good. His creation is forbearing and does not hasten to punish them.

These divine rulings that God has legislated for orphans, women, and inheritance are His laws that indicate that they are from God, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise. And whoever obeys God and His Messenger in what He has legislated for His servants of these rulings and others, He will admit him to gardens with many trees and palaces, beneath which rivers flow with their sweet water. And they will remain in this bliss and will not leave it. And that reward is the great success.

And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger by denying the rulings of God and transgressing what God has legislated for His servants by changing them or neglecting to work with them, He will admit him to a Fire to abide in it, and he will have a punishment that will disgrace and humiliate him."
m-0161	And those of your women who commit adultery, bring against them, O rulers and judges, four just men from among the Muslims. If they testify against them, confine them to their houses until their lives end in death or Allah ordains for them a way of release from that. And those who commit adultery, harm them by beating, deserting, and rebuking. But if they repent for what they have done and reform themselves with the righteous deeds they have done, then forgive their harm. It is understood from this verse and the one before it that when men commit adultery, they are harmed and women are imprisoned and harmed. Imprisonment ends in death, and harm ends in repentance and reform. This was in the early days of Islam, then it was abrogated by what Allah and His Messenger legislated, which is stoning for the married man and the married woman - they are the free, adult, sane couple who have had sexual intercourse in a valid marriage - and flogging a hundred lashes and exile for a year for others. Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful to His repentant servants.
m-0162	Allah only accepts the repentance of those who commit sins and transgressions out of ignorance of their consequences and their incurring of Allah’s wrath. Every sinner to Allah, whether by mistake or intentionally, is ignorant of this consideration, even if he knows that it is forbidden. Then they return to their Lord in repentance and obedience before witnessing death. Allah accepts the repentance of those. Allah is All-Knowing of His creation and Wise in His management and decree. Repentance is not accepted for those who persist in committing sins and do not return to their Lord until the throes of death come to them and one of them says, “I repent now.” Just as the repentance of those who die while denying and rejecting the Oneness of Allah and the message of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is not accepted. Those are the ones who persist in sins until they die, and the deniers who die while disbelievers, for them We have prepared a painful punishment.
m-0163	O you who believe, it is not lawful for you to make the wives of your fathers part of your estate, to dispose of them by marrying them or preventing them or giving them to others while they are reluctant to do all of that. Nor is it lawful for you to harm your wives while you are reluctant to them, so that they give up some of what you have given them as a dowry or the like, unless they commit an immoral act such as adultery, in which case you may keep them until you have taken what you have given them. And let your companionship with your wives be based on honor and love and fulfilling their rights. But if you hate them for some worldly reason, then be patient, for perhaps you will hate a matter of matters and there will be much good in it. And if you want to replace one wife with another and you have given the one you want to divorce a great deal of money as a dowry for her, it is not lawful for you to take anything from it. Would you take it as a lie and clear fabrication? And how is it lawful for you to take what you have given them as a dowry when each of you has enjoyed the other through sexual intercourse and they have taken from you a solemn covenant to keep them? With kindness or release them with kindness
m-0164	And do not marry women whom your fathers married, except what has already happened to you and was done in the time of ignorance, for there is no blame in it. Indeed, the marriage of sons to the wives of their fathers is an ugly and shameful matter, and its ugliness is greatly abhorrent, and Allah hates the one who does it. What an evil way and method is what you used to do in your time of ignorance. Allah has forbidden you to marry your mothers, and this includes grandmothers on the father’s or mother’s side, and your daughters, and this includes the daughters of sons and daughters, and your full sisters, or on the father’s or mother’s side, and your paternal aunts, the sisters of your fathers and grandfathers, and your maternal aunts, the sisters of your mothers and grandmothers, and your brother’s daughters, and this includes their sons, and your mothers who breastfed you, and your sisters through breastfeeding. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has forbidden through breastfeeding what is forbidden through lineage, and the mothers of your women, whether you have consummated the marriage with your women or not, and the daughters of your women from other than you, who are usually raised in your homes and under your care, and they are forbidden to you. If there is no Your laps, but on condition of consummating the marriage with their mothers. If you have not consummated the marriage with their mothers and you have divorced them or they have died before consummating the marriage, then there is no blame upon you for marrying them, just as Allah has forbidden you to marry the wives of your sons who are from your loins and those of your foster children who are related to them. This prohibition is by contracting a marriage contract with her, whether the son has consummated the marriage with her or not. It is also forbidden for you to marry two sisters at one time by blood or fosterage, except for what has already happened from you in the days of ignorance. It is also not permissible to marry a woman with her paternal or maternal aunt, as stated in the Sunnah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving to sinners if they repent, Merciful to them, and He does not burden them with what they cannot bear. It is forbidden for you to marry married women, except for those you have taken captive in jihad, for it is lawful for you to marry them after their wombs have been cleansed by a menstrual period. Allah has prescribed for you the prohibition of marrying these, and He has permitted you to marry others than they are, from what Allah has made lawful for you, that you seek with your wealth chastity from committing the forbidden. So whatever you have enjoyed from them through a valid marriage, give them their dowries which they have given. God has imposed on you for them, and there is no sin upon you in what you agree upon between you of increasing or decreasing the dowry after the obligation has been established. Indeed, God Almighty is All-Knowing of the affairs of His servants, Wise in His rulings and management.
m-0165	And whoever is not able to afford dowries for free believing women, he may marry others from among your believing slave girls. And God is the Knower of the reality of your faith. You are of one another. So marry them with the approval of their people and give them their dowries according to what you agree upon, willingly, while they are chaste and not openly committing adultery, nor rejoicing in it by taking lovers. But when they marry and commit the immorality of adultery, then upon them is half the punishment as upon free women. That which is permitted of marrying slave girls according to the above description is only permitted for one who fears for himself falling into adultery and it is difficult for him to be patient with intercourse, and patience with marrying slave girls while remaining chaste is better and preferable. And God is Forgiving and Merciful to you, since He has permitted you to marry them when you are unable to marry free women.
m-0166	God Almighty wants through these laws to clarify to you the features of His upright religion and His wise law and guide you to the ways of the prophets and righteous people before you in what is permissible and what is forbidden and to accept your repentance by returning you to acts of obedience. He, glory be to Him, is All-Knowing of what is good for His servants and is Wise in what He has prescribed for you. God wants to accept your repentance and overlook your sins, and He wants those who are led by their desires and pleasures to deviate greatly from the religion. God Almighty wants through what He has prescribed for you to make things easy and not to make things difficult for you because you were created weak.
m-0167	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, it is not lawful for you to consume one another’s wealth unjustly except in accordance with the law and lawful earnings by mutual consent. Nor should you kill one another and thus destroy yourselves by committing the forbidden acts of Allah and disobeying Him. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful in all that He has commanded you and forbidden you. And whoever commits what Allah has forbidden of taking unlawful wealth, such as theft, usurpation, and cheating, transgressing and exceeding the limits of the law, Allah will cause him to enter the Fire, suffering its heat. And that, for Allah, is easy.
m-0168	If you, O believers, stay away from major sins such as associating partners with God, disobeying parents, killing a soul unjustly, and other such things, We will remove from you the lesser sins and admit you to a noble entrance, which is Paradise.
m-0169	And do not wish for what Allah has given some of you over others in talents, provisions, and other things. Allah has given men a predetermined share of reward according to their deeds, and He has given women a share of what they have done. Ask Allah, the Generous, the Giver, to give you from His grace instead of wishing. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things, and He is Most Knowing of what is best for His servants in what He has apportioned for them of good. And to each one of you We have appointed heirs who inherit from what parents and relatives leave behind, and those with whom you have made an alliance by affirming oaths to support and give them something of the inheritance, so give them what is destined for them. And inheritance by alliance was in the beginning of Islam, then its rule was lifted by the revelation of the verses of inheritance. Indeed, Allah is aware of everything of your deeds, and He will reward you for that.
m-0170	Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, by virtue of the characteristics of guardianship and preference that Allah has given them, and by virtue of the dowries and expenses that they have given them. The righteous and upright women among them, who adhere to the law of Allah, are obedient to Allah and to their husbands, and they guard everything that is hidden from their husbands’ knowledge, by virtue of what they have been entrusted with, by Allah’s protection and guidance. As for those among them whom you fear may disobey you, advise them with kind words. If the kind words do not bear fruit with them, then forsake them in bed and do not approach them. If the act of forsake does not have any effect on them, then strike them with a strike that does not cause harm. If they obey you, then beware of wronging them, for Allah, the Most High, the Great, is their protector and He will take revenge on whoever wrongs them and transgresses against them. And if you know, O guardians of the spouses, of a discord between them that leads to separation, then send to them a just arbitrator from the husband’s family and a just arbitrator from the wife’s family, so that they may consider and rule in a way that is in their best interests. Because of the arbitrators’ desire for reconciliation and their use of a good approach, Allah will bring about reconciliation between the spouses. Indeed, Allah, the Most High, is All-Knowing, and nothing is hidden from Him. He is All-Knowing of what is in the hearts of His servants.
m-0171	"And worship Allah and submit to Him alone and do not make for Him a partner in Lordship and worship and be good to parents and fulfill their rights and the rights of relatives and orphans and the needy and the neighbor near you and the distant and the companion in travel and in the city and the needy traveler and the slaves from your young men and women. Indeed, Allah does not love the arrogant among His servants who boast to people

Those who refrain from spending and giving from what Allah has provided them and command others to be miserly and deny Allah’s blessings upon them and conceal His favor and gifts. And We have prepared for the ungrateful a disgraceful punishment.

And We have prepared this punishment likewise for those who spend their wealth for show and reputation and do not believe in Allah in belief and action or in the Day of Resurrection. These evil deeds are among what Satan calls for, and whoever Satan is a companion to, then what an evil companion and companion.

And what harm would befall them if they believed in Allah and the Last Day in belief and action and spent from what Allah has given them with expectation and sincerity? And Allah is All-Knowing of them and what they do and will hold them accountable for that. Indeed, Allah does not diminish anyone’s The reward for his work is the weight of an atom, and if the weight of an atom is good, then God Almighty increases it and multiplies it for its owner and bestows upon him more and gives him from Him a great reward, which is Paradise."
m-0172	How will the people be on the Day of Resurrection when Allah brings from every nation its Messenger to bear witness against them as to what they did, and He brings you, O Messenger, to be a witness over your nation that you conveyed to them the message of your Lord? On the Day that will happen, those who disbelieved in Allah, the Most High, and disobeyed the Messenger and did not obey him will wish that Allah would make them and the earth equal so that they would become dust so that they would not be resurrected, and they will not be able to hide from Allah anything of what is in their souls, as Allah has sealed up their mouths and their limbs will bear witness against them as to what they used to do.
m-0173	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not approach prayer or stand for it while you are intoxicated until you have distinguished and known what you are saying. This was before the absolute prohibition of alcohol in every case. And do not approach prayer while you are in a state of major ritual impurity, and do not approach its places, which are the mosques, except for those among you who are passing through from door to door, until you have purified yourselves. And if you are in a state of illness in which you are unable to use water, or in a state of travel, or one of you comes from the privy, or you have had intercourse with women and you do not find water for purification, then seek clean earth and wipe your faces and your hands with it. Indeed, Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving of you.
m-0174	Did you not know, O Messenger, the affair of the Jews who were given a portion of knowledge from what came to them from the Torah? They exchange misguidance for guidance and abandon the arguments and proofs they have that prove the truth of the message of the Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. They wish for you, O guided believers, that you deviate from the straight path so that you would be astray like them. And God, the Most High, the Most Great, knows better than you, O believers, about the enmity of these Jews towards you. And God is sufficient as a guardian who takes care of you, and He is sufficient as a supporter who helps you against your enemies. Among the Jews is a group who persist in changing the word of God and altering it from what it is, slandering God. They say to the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, “We have heard your statement and disobeyed your command, and listen to us, you did not hear.” And they say, “Ra’ina, your hearing,” meaning, “Understand from us and make us understand.” They twist their tongues with that, intending to call upon him to be reckless according to their language and to attack the religion of Islam. If they had said, “We have heard and obeyed,” instead of “We have disobeyed,” and “Listen without listening,” and “Unzurna,” instead of “Ra’ina,” that would have been better for them with God and more just in speech. But God He expelled them from His mercy because of their disbelief and denial of the prophethood of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. They do not believe in the truth except a little belief that does not benefit them.
m-0175	O People of the Book, believe and act according to what We have sent down of the Qur’an, confirming what is with you of the Scriptures, before We seize you for your evil deeds and obliterate faces and transform them before they appear, or We curse these corrupters by transforming them into apes and pigs, as We cursed the Jews among the Sabbath-watchmen who were forbidden from hunting on the Sabbath but did not desist, so Allah became angry with them and expelled them from His mercy. And Allah’s command is carried out in every case. Indeed, Allah does not forgive or overlook anyone who associates any of His creations with Him or disbelieves in any type of major disbelief, but He overlooks and pardons sins less than association for whomever He wills of His servants. And whoever associates other than Him with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.
m-0176	Did you not know, O Messenger, the matter of those who praise themselves and their deeds and describe them as pure and far from evil? Rather, God Almighty alone is the One who praises whomever He wills of His servants, because He knows the truth of their deeds, and He does not diminish anything from their deeds, the size of a thread that is in the slit of a date seed. Look at them, O Messenger, astonished at their matter, how they fabricate lies about God, while He is far removed from everything that is not befitting of Him. This fabrication is sufficient as a great sin, revealing the corruption of their belief.
m-0177	Have you not known, O Messenger, the affair of those Jews who were given a portion of knowledge, believing in everything that is worshipped besides Allah, from idols and devils among mankind and jinn, a belief that leads them to resort to other than Allah’s law, and they say to those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, “These disbelievers are more upright and just in their path than those who believed.” Those are the ones whose corruption has become widespread and whose misguidance has become widespread, Allah has expelled them from His mercy. And whomever Allah expels from His mercy, you will not find anyone to support him or ward off from him the evil of the punishment. Rather, they have been inspired with a portion of the kingdom, and if they had been given it, they would not have given anyone anything of it, even if it were the size of a pit in the back of a date pit. Rather, do they envy Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for what Allah has given him of the blessing of prophethood and the message, and do they envy his companions for the blessing of success in faith and belief in the message and following the Messenger and empowerment in the land, and they wish for this favor to be removed from them? We gave to the descendants of Abraham, peace be upon him, before the books that Allah sent down to them and what was revealed to them that was not a readable book, and We gave them in addition to that A vast kingdom. Among those who were given a share of knowledge are those who believed in the message of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and acted according to his law. Among them are those who turned away and did not respond to his call and prevented people from following him. And enough for you, O deniers, is the fire of Hell, which burns you.
m-0178	Indeed, those who have denied what Allah has sent down of His verses and the revelation of His Book and His proofs and arguments - We will surely admit them into a Fire, suffering its heat. Every time their skins are burned, We will replace them with other skins so that their torment and pain will continue. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might, and nothing is impossible for Him. He is Wise in His management and judgment. And those whose hearts are reassured by faith in Allah Almighty and belief in the message of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and who are steadfast in obedience - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, enjoying themselves therein forever and never leaving it. And they will have therein spouses whom Allah has purified from every harm. And We will admit them to a dense, extended shade in Paradise.
m-0179	Allah the Almighty commands you to return the various trusts that you have been entrusted with to their owners, so do not be negligent in them. He commands you to judge between people with justice and equity when you judge between them. What an excellent thing Allah admonishes you with and guides you to. Indeed, Allah the Almighty is ever Hearing of your words, Knowing of all your deeds, Seeing them. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, respond to the commands of Allah the Almighty and do not disobey him. Respond to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in what he brought of the truth, and obey your rulers in anything that does not involve disobedience to Allah. If you differ among yourselves about something, refer the ruling to the Book of Allah the Almighty and the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, if you truly believe in Allah the Almighty and in the Day of Judgment. That referring to the Book and the Sunnah is better for you than disputing and speaking according to one’s own opinion, and it is the best outcome and final result.
m-0180	Did you not know, O Messenger, the situation of those hypocrites who claim to believe in what was revealed to you, which is the Qur’an, and what was revealed to the Messengers before you, and they want to settle disputes between them by other than what Allah has legislated, which is falsehood, and they were commanded to disbelieve in falsehood, and Satan wants to distance them far from the path of truth. In this verse is evidence that true faith requires submission to Allah’s law and ruling by it in every matter. So whoever claims that he is a believer and chooses the rule of the tyrant over the rule of Allah, then he is lying in his claim. And if these people are advised and told to come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger Muhammad, may Allah’s prayers and peace be upon him, and his guidance, you will see those who show faith but conceal disbelief turn away from you. So what will be the situation of those hypocrites if a calamity befalls them because of what they have committed with their own hands, then they come to you, O Messenger, apologizing and confirming to you that they intended nothing by their actions except to do good and reconcile the opponents? Those are the ones in whose hearts Allah knows the truth of hypocrisy, so turn away from them and warn them against The evil of what they are doing and say to them a word that will affect them and deter them
m-0181	And We did not send any of Our Messengers except that he would be answered by the command and decree of Allah the Most High. And if these people who wronged themselves by committing evil deeds had come to you, O Messenger, during your lifetime, repenting, asking Allah to forgive them their sins, and you had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Forgiving and Merciful. Allah the Most High swears by His noble self that these people will not truly believe until they make you a judge in the dispute that occurred between them during your lifetime and refer to your Sunnah after your death, and then they do not find in themselves any distress over what your judgment has concluded, and they nevertheless submit completely. So ruling by what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, brought from the Book and the Sunnah in every aspect of life is from the core of faith, along with contentment and submission.
m-0182	If We had made it obligatory for these hypocrites who seek judgment from the tyrant to kill each other or to leave their homes, only a few of them would have responded to that. If they had responded to what they were advised to do, that would have been beneficial for them and strengthened their faith, and We would have given them from Ourself a great reward in this world and the Hereafter, and We would have guided them and guided them to the straight path of Allah. If We had made it obligatory for these hypocrites who seek judgment from the tyrant to kill each other or to leave their homes, only a few of them would have responded to that. If they had responded to what they were advised to do, that would have been beneficial for them and strengthened their faith, and We would have given them from Ourself a great reward in this world and the Hereafter. And whoever responds to the commands of Allah Almighty and the guidance of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, then those are the ones whose status and esteem are great, so they will be in the company of those upon whom Allah Almighty has bestowed Paradise from among the prophets and the truthful ones who have completed their belief in what the messengers brought in belief, word and deed, and the martyrs in the way of Allah and the righteous believers. And excellent are these companions in Paradise. This is the abundant gift from Allah alone, and Allah is sufficient as All-Knowing, knowing the conditions of His servants and who among them deserves the abundant reward for what he has done of righteous deeds.
m-0183	"O you who believe, take your precaution and prepare for your enemy, so go out to meet him in groups or together.

And there are some among you who lag behind in going out to meet the enemy, sluggishly, and he discourages others deliberately and persistently. But if he is able to defeat you and you are killed and defeated, he says with good tidings, ""God has preserved me while I was not present with those to whom what I hate for myself has happened."" And he was pleased by his staying behind from you.

And if you receive bounty from God and spoils, he will surely say, envious and regretful, as if there had been no love between you and him outwardly, ""Oh, I wish I had been with them so I could have attained what they attained of salvation, victory, and spoils."""
m-0184	And let those who sell the life of this world for the home of the Hereafter and its reward strive in the cause of victory for the religion of Allah and the elevation of His word. And whoever strives in the cause of Allah sincerely and is killed or is victorious - We will give him a great reward. And what prevents you, O believers, from striving in the cause of victory for the religion of Allah and the victory of His weak servants, men, women and children, who have been attacked and have no means or means except to seek help from their Lord, calling upon Him, saying, “Our Lord, take us out of this city” - meaning Mecca, whose people have wronged themselves by disbelief and the believers by harming them - and appoint for us from Yourself a protector who will take care of our affairs and a helper who will support us against the wrongdoers. Those who are true in their faith in belief and action strive in the cause of victory for the truth and its people, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of oppression and corruption in the land. So fight, O believers, against the people of disbelief and polytheism who take Satan as allies and obey his command. Indeed, Satan’s planning for his allies has ever been weak.
m-0185	Did you not know, O Messenger, the situation of those who were told before the permission to wage jihad, “Refrain your hands from fighting your enemies from the polytheists, and you must perform what Allah has enjoined upon you of prayer and zakat.” But when fighting was enjoined upon them, behold, a group of them changed their condition, and they began to fear and dread people as they fear Allah or even more, and they declared the intense fear that had overcome them, saying, “Our Lord, why have You enjoined fighting upon us? Why did You not grant us respite until a short time?” Desiring the enjoyment of worldly life, tell them, O Messenger, “The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter and what is in it are greater and more lasting for he who fears Allah, so he does what he is commanded to do and avoids what he is forbidden to do. Your Lord does not wrong anyone in the least, even if it is the size of a thread that is in the crack of a date seed. Wherever you are, death will overtake you wherever you are when your appointed times arrive, even if you are in impregnable fortresses far from the battlefield and fighting. And if they obtain what pleases them from the enjoyment of this life, they attribute its occurrence to Allah Almighty, and if what they dislike befalls them, they attribute it to the Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, out of ignorance and pessimism, and they do not know.” All of this is from God alone, by His decree and destiny. So why do they not come close to understanding any speech that you speak to them? Whatever good and blessing befalls you, O human being, is from God Almighty alone, as a favor and kindness. Whatever hardship and difficulty befalls you, is because of your bad deeds and the sins and misdeeds that your hands have committed. And We have sent you, O Messenger, to all people as a Messenger to convey to them the message of your Lord. And sufficient is God as a witness to the truth of your message.
m-0186	"Whoever responds to the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, and acts according to his guidance, has responded to God Almighty and complied with His command. And whoever turns away from obeying God and His Messenger, then We have not sent you, O Messenger, as a watcher over these objectors, to record their deeds and hold them accountable for them. Their reckoning is upon Us.

And these objectors, while they are in the assembly of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, show their obedience to the Messenger and what he brought, but when they turn away from him and leave his assembly, a group of them plots at night other than what they declared of obedience, and they do not know that God is counting what they plot and will reward them for it with the most complete reward. So turn away from them, O Messenger, and do not care about them, for they will not harm you, and put your trust in God, and He is sufficient for you as a guardian and supporter.

Do these people not look at the Qur’an and what it brought of truth with a look of contemplation and reflection, since it came in a perfect order that definitively states that it is from God alone? Had it been from someone other than Him, they would have found in it much discrepancy.

And if something comes to these people, in whose hearts faith has not been established, that must be concealed, related to the security that will benefit Islam and the Muslims, or to the fear that will cast into their hearts a lack of They spread and broadcast reassurance among the people. If these people had returned what came to them to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and to the people of knowledge and jurisprudence, the people of deduction among them would have known the true meaning of it. And if it were not for Allah’s favor upon you and His mercy upon you, you would have followed Satan and his whispers, except for a few of you. So strive, O Prophet, in the way of Allah to make His word supreme. Do not force the actions of others, nor will you be held accountable for them. Urge the believers to fight and strive and encourage them to do so, perhaps Allah will protect you and them from the might and severity of the disbelievers. And Allah, the Most High, is stronger in strength and has a greater punishment for the disbelievers."
m-0187	"Whoever seeks to bring good to others will have a share of the reward through his intercession, and whoever seeks to bring evil to others will have a share of the burden and sin. And Allah is Witness and Guardian over all things.

If a Muslim greets you, respond to him with better words and cheerfulness than he greeted, or respond to him with the same as he greeted. And each has his own reward and recompense. Indeed, Allah is the Rewarder of all things.

Allah alone is the One who is unique in divinity for all creation. He will gather you on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt, for the reckoning and recompense. And no one is more truthful than Allah in what He has informed us of."
m-0188	What is the matter with you, O believers, concerning the hypocrites, when you differ into two groups, one group saying that they should be fought and the other saying that they should not, and Allah, the Most High, has caused them to fall into disbelief and misguidance because of their evil deeds? Do you desire guidance for one whose heart Allah has turned away from His religion? And whom Allah has let down from His religion and from following what He has commanded him, there is no path for him to guidance? The hypocrites wish for you, O believers, that you would deny the truth of what your hearts believe in, just as they denied it in their hearts, so that you would be with them in denial. So do not take them as your close friends until they emigrate in the cause of Allah, as proof of the truth of their faith. But if they turn away from what they have called to, then seize them wherever they are and kill them. Do not take from them any friend besides Allah, nor any helper to seek help from.
m-0189	But those who are connected with a people between you and whom there is a treaty and a covenant, do not fight them. And likewise those who come to you while their breasts are constricted and they dislike fighting you as they dislike fighting their own people, so they are not with you or with their own people, so do not fight them. And if Allah had willed, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you along with your enemies from among the polytheists. But Allah has turned them away from you by His grace and power. So if they leave you and do not fight you and submit to you in submission, then you have no way to fight them. You will find another people from among the hypocrites who desire reassurance from you, so they show you faith, and they desire reassurance from their own people, the disbelievers, so they show them disbelief. Whenever they are returned to the homeland of disbelief and disbelievers, they fall into the worst state. So if these do not turn away from you and offer you complete submission and prevent themselves from fighting you, then seize them forcefully and kill them wherever they are. And those who have reached in this evil behavior a limit that distinguishes them from those other than them, they are the ones for whom We have made clear evidence for killing them. And their families
m-0190	It is not permissible for a believer to attack his believing brother and kill him unjustly unless he does so by mistake and not intentionally. Whoever commits such a mistake must free a believing slave and pay the prescribed blood money to his guardians unless they give it in charity and pardon him. If the one killed is from a people who are disbelievers and enemies of the believers and he believes in Allah Almighty and in what He revealed of the truth to His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, then his killer must free a believing slave. If he is from a people between whom and you there is a treaty and a covenant, then his killer must pay blood money to be given to his guardians and free a believing slave. Whoever is not able to free a believing slave must fast for two consecutive months so that Allah Almighty may accept his repentance. Allah Almighty is All-Knowing of the true state of His servants, Wise in what He has prescribed for them. Whoever attacks a believer and kills him intentionally and unjustly, his punishment is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, with Allah Almighty’s wrath upon him and his expulsion from His mercy if He punishes him for his sin. Allah has prepared for him the most severe punishment because of what he committed of this great crime, but He, glory be to Him, pardons. He is gracious to the people of faith and does not punish them with eternal damnation in Hell.
m-0191	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, when you go forth in the land striving in the cause of Allah, then be clear about what you do and leave behind. And do not deny faith from one who has shown any signs of Islam and does not fight you, because of the possibility that he may be a believer who hides his faith, seeking thereby the enjoyment of worldly life. And Allah has with Him bounty and gifts what will suffice you. Thus, at the beginning of Islam, you concealed your faith from your people from the polytheists. But Allah has been gracious to you and has honored you with faith and strength. So be clear and knowledgeable in your affairs. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of all your deeds, aware of the details of your affairs, and He will reward you for them.
m-0192	Those who stay behind from jihad in the way of Allah, except those who have excuses, are not equal to those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah Almighty has favored the mujahideen over those who sit back and raised their status to a high degree in Paradise. Allah has promised both those who strive with their wealth and their lives and those who sit back among those with excuses Paradise for what they have given and sacrificed in the way of truth. Allah Almighty has favored the mujahideen over those who sit back with a great reward. This great reward is high status in Paradise from Allah Almighty for His special servants who strive in His way and forgiveness for their sins and a vast mercy in which they enjoy. Allah is Forgiving to those who repent to Him and turn back, Merciful to those who obey Him and strive in His way.
m-0193	"Those whom the angels take after they have wronged themselves by remaining in the land of disbelief and not emigrating, the angels will say to them, rebuking them, “In what state were you in your religion?” They will say, “We were weak in our land, unable to repel oppression and subjugation from us.” They will say, rebuking them, “Was not the earth of Allah spacious so that you could leave your land for another land where you would be safe for your religion?” Those will have the Fire as their abode, and how ugly is this return and destination.

And the weak among men, women, and children who are unable to repel oppression and injustice from themselves and do not know a way to save them from the suffering they are in are excused from that fate.

These weak ones are the ones for whom Allah the Most High hopes for forgiveness, because He the Most High knows the truth of their situation, and Allah is Forgiving and Pardoning.

And whoever leaves the land of polytheism for the land of Islam, fleeing for his religion, hoping for the favor of his Lord, intending to support his religion, will find on earth a place and a refuge in which he will enjoy what will be a reason for his strength and the humiliation of his enemies, along with the spaciousness in his provision and living. And whoever leaves his home intending to support the religion of Allah And his Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, and the elevation of the word of God, then death overtakes him before he reaches his destination, then the reward for his work has been established for him by God as a favor and kindness from Him, and God is Forgiving and Merciful to His servants."
m-0194	And if you travel, O believers, in the land of Allah, there is no blame or sin upon you in shortening the prayer if you fear aggression from the disbelievers against you while you are praying. Most of the travels of the Muslims at the beginning of Islam were frightening, and shortening is a concession in travel in times of security or fear. The disbelievers are openly hostile to you, so beware of them. And if you, O Prophet, are on the battlefield and you want to lead them in prayer, then let a group of them stand with you to pray and take their weapons. When these people prostrate, let the other group stand behind you facing your enemy. The first group completes their second rak’ah and says the salutation. Then the other group that has not started the prayer comes and let them follow you in their first rak’ah, then complete their second rak’ah themselves. Let them beware of their enemy and take their weapons. The deniers of the religion of Allah wish that you should neglect your weapons and provisions so that they may attack you with a heavy attack and destroy you. But there is no sin upon you then. If you are harmed by rain or you are sick, that you leave your weapons behind while taking precautions. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the deniers of His religion a punishment. He humiliates and disgraces them. So if you perform the prayer, then continue to remember God in all your circumstances. And if the fear is gone, then perform the prayer completely and do not neglect it, for it is obligatory at specific times in the Sharia.
m-0195	Do not weaken in seeking out and fighting your enemy. If you are suffering from the fighting and its effects, then your enemies are also suffering from it in the most severe way. However, they do not desist from fighting you. You are more deserving of that than they are, because of the reward, victory, and support you hope for, while they do not hope for that. And God is All-Knowing of all your conditions, Wise in His command and management.
m-0196	Indeed, We have sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an, containing the truth, so that you may judge between all people by what God has revealed to you and made you aware of. So do not be a defender of those who betray themselves by concealing the truth, with what they have supported for you of the statement that is contrary to the truth.
m-0197	"And ask Allah the Almighty for forgiveness in all your circumstances, for Allah the Almighty is Forgiving to those who hope for His grace and attainment of His forgiveness, and Merciful to them.

And do not defend those who betray themselves by disobeying Allah, for Allah the Almighty does not love those whose betrayal is great and whose sins are many.

They hide from people for fear that they will find out about their bad deeds, but they do not hide from Allah the Almighty and are not ashamed of Him, while He, the Almighty, is with them with His knowledge, watching them when they plot at night what He does not approve of in speech. And Allah the Almighty encompasses all their words and actions, and nothing of them is hidden from Him.

Here you are, O believers, you have argued on behalf of those who betrayed themselves in this worldly life, so who will argue with Allah the Almighty on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection and Reckoning? And who is the one who will be a guardian over these traitors on the Day of Resurrection?"
m-0198	Whoever commits a bad and ugly deed or wrongs himself by committing something that contradicts the ruling of Allah and His law, then returns to Allah regretting what he has done, hoping for His forgiveness and covering of his sin, will find Allah Most High Forgiving and Merciful. Whoever commits a sin, he only harms himself thereby. And Allah Most High is Knowing of the truth of the affair of His servants, Wise in what He decrees between His creation. Whoever commits a sin unintentionally or commits a sin deliberately, then attributes what he has committed to an innocent soul that has no crime, then he has indeed borne a lie and a clear sin.
m-0199	And had it not been that God Almighty has bestowed upon you, O Messenger, and had mercy upon you, with the blessing of prophethood, and protected you by His guidance in what He revealed to you, a group of those who betray themselves would have resolved to lead you astray from the path of truth. And they only lead themselves astray in that, and they are not able to harm you because God has protected you, and God has revealed to you the Qur’an and the Sunnah that explains it, and He has guided you to knowledge that you did not know before. And what God has singled you out with of grace is a great matter.
m-0200	There is no benefit in much of what people say secretly among themselves unless it is a talk that calls for doing good deeds such as charity, or a kind word, or reconciliation between people. And whoever does these things seeking the pleasure of Allah Almighty, hoping for His reward, We will give him a great and abundant reward. And whoever opposes the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, after the truth has become clear to him, and follows a path other than the path of the believers and what they are upon of the truth, We will leave him and what he has turned to, and We will not guide him to goodness, and We will admit him to the fire of Hell, suffering its heat. And this is an evil destination and a wretched place.
m-0201	God Almighty does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives sins less than association for whomever He wills among His servants. Whoever makes a partner for God Almighty, the One and Only, from among His creation has strayed far from the truth.
m-0202	The polytheists worship nothing besides Allah except idols that neither benefit nor harm. And they worship nothing but a rebellious devil who has reached a great degree of corruption and depravity. Allah expelled him from His mercy. And Satan said, “I will surely take from among Your servants a known portion to mislead them in word and deed. And I will turn away from the truth whoever follows me, and I will promise them false desires. And I will call them to cut off the ears of cattle and split them open, because of the falsehood that I have made attractive to them. And I will call them to change the creation of Allah in the innate disposition and the form of creation. And whoever responds to Satan and takes him as a supporter instead of Allah, the Strong, the Almighty, has certainly perished with a clear destruction. Satan promises his followers false promises and tempts them with false, deceptive desires. And he promises them nothing but a deception that has no truth or evidence. Those will end up in Hell, and they will find no escape from it or refuge.
m-0203	And those who are true in their faith in Allah the Most High and follow their faith with righteous deeds, Allah will admit them by His grace to gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. This is a promise from Allah the Most High, who does not fail in His promise. No one is more truthful than Allah the Most High in His words and promises. This great favor is not attained by the wishes that you Muslims desire, nor by the wishes of the People of the Book, the Jews and Christians. Rather, it is attained by sincere faith in Allah the Most High and doing good deeds that please Him. And whoever does evil deeds will be recompensed for them and will not find for himself except Allah the Most High a guardian to take care of his affairs and concerns, nor a supporter to aid him and ward off from him the evil of the punishment. And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, and believes in Allah the Most High and in what He has revealed of the truth, Allah will admit them to Paradise, the abode of eternal bliss, and they will not be diminished in the least from the reward of their deeds, even if it were the size of a pit in the back of a date pit. No one has a better religion than one who submits with his heart and all his limbs to Allah the Most High alone, and is a doer of good, and follows the religion of Abraham and his law, turning away from corrupt beliefs and false laws. And Allah chose Abraham, peace be upon him. And He chose him as a close friend from among all His creation. In this verse, there is proof of the attribute of friendship for God Almighty, which is the highest level of love and selection. To God belongs all that is in this universe of creatures, for they belong to Him alone. And God Almighty encompasses everything, and nothing of the affairs of His creation is hidden from Him.
m-0204	People ask you, O Prophet, to explain to them what they have difficulty understanding about women’s issues and rulings. Say, “Allah makes clear to you their affairs and what is recited to you in the Book concerning orphan women to whom you do not give what Allah has ordained for them of dowry and inheritance and other rights, and you love to marry them or you are reluctant to marry them. And Allah makes clear to you the matter of the weak among the young and the obligation to act justly towards orphans and to refrain from injustice towards them in their rights. Whatever good you do, Allah is All-Knowing of it. Nothing of it or of anything else is hidden from Him.”
m-0205	If a woman knows that her husband is arrogant and haughty towards her or has turned away from her, then there is no sin on them if they reconcile on a basis that pleases them both in terms of division or maintenance. Reconciliation is better and preferable. Human beings are naturally stingy and miserly. If you treat your wives well and fear Allah in dealing with them, then Allah is All-Knowing of what you do in this and other matters. Nothing is hidden from Him, and He will reward you for that. You men will never be able to achieve complete justice between women in love and inclination of the heart, no matter how much effort you put into that. So do not completely turn away from the one you desire, leaving her like a woman who has no husband or is divorced, lest you sin. But if you improve your actions, then be just in your division between your wives, and be mindful of Allah and fear Him in dealing with them, for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to His servants. If separation occurs between a man and his wife, then Allah will enrich each of them from His bounty and generosity, for He, glory be to Him, is Vast in bounty and favor, Wise in what He decrees between His servants.
m-0206	And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever is between them. And We have already made a covenant with those who were given the Scripture before you, among the Jews and the Christians, and We have also made a covenant with you, O nation of Muhammad, to fear Allah the Most High, and to carry out His commands and avoid what He has forbidden. And We have made clear to you that if you deny the Oneness of Allah the Most High and His law, then He, glory be to Him, is independent of you because He owns everything in the heavens and the earth. And Allah is independent of His creation, Praiseworthy in His attributes and actions. And to Allah belongs whatever is in this universe of beings, and He is sufficient as a guardian of the affairs of His creation and a protector of them. If Allah wills, He can destroy you, O people, and bring another people other than you. And Allah is ever competent to do that. Whoever among you, O people, desires the reward of this world and turns away from the Hereafter, then with Allah alone is the reward of this world and the Hereafter. So let him seek from Allah alone the best of this world and the Hereafter, for He is the One who owns them. And Allah is All-Hearing to the words of His servants, All-Seeing of their deeds and intentions, and He will reward them for that.
m-0207	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, be upholding justice, giving testimony for the sake of Allah, the Most High, even if it is against yourselves or your fathers and mothers or your relatives, regardless of the status of the one being testified against, whether rich or poor, for Allah, the Most High, is closer to them than you and knows best what is best for them. So do not let desire and fanaticism lead you to abandon justice, even if you distort the testimony with your tongues, giving it in a way other than its truth, or turning away from it by not performing it or concealing it, for Allah, the Most High, is All-Knowing of the details of your actions and will reward you for them. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, persist in what you are upon of firm belief in Allah, the Most High, and in His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and in obeying them and in the Qur’an that He revealed to him and in all the books that Allah revealed to the messengers. And whoever disbelieves in Allah, the Most High, and His honored angels and His books that He revealed to guide His creation and His messengers whom He chose to convey His message and the Last Day when people will stand after their death for presentation and reckoning, then He left the religion and went far away from the path of truth.
m-0208	Those who have entered into faith, then turned back to disbelief, then returned to faith, then returned to disbelief again, then persisted in their disbelief and continued in it, Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to a path of guidance by which they will be saved from the evil end. O Messenger, give good tidings to the hypocrites, who outwardly show faith but inwardly conceal disbelief, that they will have a painful punishment. Those who befriend the disbelievers and take them as their helpers, and abandon the allegiance of the believers and do not desire their friendship. Are they thereby seeking victory and protection from the disbelievers? They do not possess that. Victory, honor, and strength are all for Allah, the Most High, alone.
m-0209	And it has been revealed to you, O believers, in the Book of your Lord that if you hear disbelief in the verses of Allah and mockery of them, then do not sit with the disbelievers and the mockers unless they engage in a conversation other than the conversation of disbelief and mockery of the verses of Allah. If you sit with them while they are as they are, then you are like them because you are satisfied with their disbelief and mockery. And the one who is satisfied with disobedience is like the one who commits it. Indeed, Allah, the Most High, will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers in the fire of Hell, all of them, wherein they will receive the worst of torment. The hypocrites are those who await what will befall you, O believers, of trials and war. Then Allah has bestowed His grace upon you and given you victory over your enemy and you have gained spoils. They will say to you, “Were we not with you, supporting you?” And if the deniers of this religion have a measure of victory and spoils, they will say to them, “Did we not help you with what we provided for you and protect you from the believers?” So Allah, the Most High, will judge between you and them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will not give the disbelievers a way to prevail over His righteous servants. So the outcome is for the righteous in this world and the Hereafter. Indeed, the way of these hypocrites is to deceive Allah, the Most High, with what They show faith and conceal disbelief, thinking that it is hidden from Allah, while the reality is that Allah is deceiving them and rewarding them according to their deeds. When these hypocrites stand up to perform the prayer, they stand up in a state of sluggishness, intending by their prayer to show off and gain fame, and they do not mention Allah except a little. It is the nature of these hypocrites to hesitate, bewilder, and bewildered. They do not settle on a state, so they are neither with the believers nor with the disbelievers. And whoever Allah turns his heart away from faith in Him and adherence to His guidance, you will not find for him a path to guidance and certainty.
m-0210	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not befriend those who deny the religion of Allah and abandon the friendship and love of the believers. Do you want, through the friendship of your enemies, to make for Allah Almighty a clear proof against you that you are not sincere in your faith? The hypocrites will be in the lowest levels of Hell on the Day of Resurrection, and you will not find for them, O Messenger, a supporter who will protect them from this evil fate.
m-0211	Except for those who return to Allah Almighty and repent to Him and correct what they have corrupted of their conditions, inwardly and outwardly, and befriend His believing servants and hold fast to the religion of Allah and are sincere to Him, glory be to Him. Then they will be with the believers in this world and the Hereafter, and Allah will give the believers a great reward. What would Allah do with your punishment if you correct your deeds and believe in Allah and His Messenger? Indeed, Allah, glory be to Him, is independent of anyone other than Him. He only punishes the servants for their sins. And Allah is ever grateful to His servants for their obedience to Him, and He is All-Knowing of everything.
m-0212	God does not like anyone to speak ill of others, but it is permissible for the wronged person to mention his wrongdoer with his evil in order to show his injustice. God is All-Hearing of what you say publicly, All-Knowing of what you conceal. God Almighty urged forgiveness and paved the way for it by saying that the believer either shows goodness or hides it. Likewise with wrongdoing, he either shows it when seeking revenge on the wrongdoer or he pardons and forgives. Forgiveness is better, for one of His attributes is to pardon His servants despite His power over them.
m-0213	Those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers from among the Jews and Christians and want to make distinction between Allah and His messengers by believing in Allah and denying His messengers whom He sent to His creation or by acknowledging the truth of some messengers and not others and claiming that some of them fabricated lies against their Lord and want to take a path to the misguidance that they have created and the innovation that they have invented. Those are the people of proven disbelief about which there is no doubt. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a punishment that will disgrace and humiliate them. But those who believe in the Oneness of Allah and acknowledge the prophethood of all His messengers and do not differentiate between any of them and act according to the law of Allah - those will He give them their reward and recompense for their belief in Him and His messengers. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
m-0214	"The Jews ask you, O Messenger, for a miracle like the miracle of Moses that would testify to your truthfulness, by sending down to them written scrolls from God, like the coming of Moses with the tablets from God. So do not be surprised, O Messenger, for their ancestors asked Moses, peace be upon him, for something greater. They asked him to show them God publicly, so they were struck dumb because of their injustice to themselves when they asked for something that was not their right. After God revived them after the strike and they witnessed the clear signs at the hand of Moses, who decisively denied polytheism, they worshipped the calf instead of God, so We pardoned their worship of the calf because of their repentance, and We gave Moses a great proof that confirms the truthfulness of his prophethood. And We raised Mount Tur above their heads when they refused to abide by the confirmed covenant that they had given to work according to the provisions of the Torah, and We commanded them to enter the gate of the Holy House in prostration, so they entered crawling on their buttocks, and We commanded them not to transgress by hunting on the Sabbath, so they transgressed and hunted, and We took from them a confirmed covenant, but they broke it. So We cursed them because of their breaking of the covenants and their disbelief in the signs of God that prove the truthfulness of His messengers and their killing of the prophets. Injustice and aggression and their saying, “Our hearts have coverings over them, so you do not understand what you say.” Rather, Allah has covered them because of their disbelief, so they do not believe except a little faith that does not benefit them.

And likewise, We cursed them because of their disbelief and their slander against Mary, by attributing to her adultery, although she was innocent of it.

And because of their saying, by way of mockery and ridicule, “This one who claims this position for himself, we killed him, but they did not kill Jesus, nor did they crucify him. Rather, they crucified a man similar to him, thinking that he was Jesus.” And whoever claimed to have killed him from the Jews and whoever handed him over to them from the Christians, they are all in doubt and confusion, with no knowledge except following conjecture. And they did not kill him, being certain, but doubting and imagining.

Rather, Allah raised Jesus to Himself, body and soul, alive, and purified him from those who disbelieved. And Allah is Exalted in His Kingdom, Wise in His management and judgment.
And no one from the People of the Book will remain after the descent of Jesus at the end of time except that he will believe in him before his death, peace be upon him, and on the Day of Resurrection, Jesus, peace be upon him, will be a witness to the denial of those who denied him and the confirmation of those who confirmed him.

So because of the injustice of the Jews in what they committed of Great sins, God forbade them good foods that were lawful for them, and because they turned themselves and others away from the true religion of God, and because they consumed usury, which they were forbidden from, and took people’s money without right. And We have prepared for the disbelievers in God and His Messenger, from among these Jews, a painful punishment in the Hereafter."
m-0215	But those who are well-versed in the knowledge of the rulings of God from among the Jews and the believers in God and His Messenger believe in what God has revealed to you, O Messenger, which is the Qur’an, and in what was revealed to the Messengers before you, such as the Torah and the Gospel, and they perform the prayer at its appointed times and give the zakat of their wealth and believe in God and in the Resurrection and recompense. Those, God will give them a great reward, which is Paradise.
m-0216	Indeed, We have inspired you, O Messenger, to convey the message as We inspired Noah and the prophets after him, and We inspired Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the tribes, who were the prophets who were in the twelve tribes of the Children of Israel from the descendants of Jacob, Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. And We gave David the Psalms, which is a book and written pages. And We sent messengers whom We have mentioned to you in the Qur’an before this verse, and messengers whom We have not mentioned to you for a wisdom We intended. And God spoke to Moses directly, honoring him with this attribute. And in this noble verse, there is proof of the attribute of speech for God Almighty as befits His Majesty, and that He, glory be to Him, spoke to His Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, in reality, without intermediary. I sent messengers to My creation, bringing good tidings of My reward and warning of My punishment, so that mankind would not have an excuse to make after sending the messengers. And God is Exalted in His kingdom, Wise in His management. If the Jews and others disbelieve in you, O Messenger, then God bears witness that you are His Messenger to whom the Great Qur’an was sent down. He sent it down with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness to the truth of what was revealed to you. And the testimony of God alone is sufficient.
m-0217	Those who denied your prophethood and turned people away from Islam have strayed far from the path of truth. Those who disbelieved in God and His Messenger and were unjust by continuing in their disbelief - God will not forgive their sins nor guide them to a path that will save them - except the path of Hell, wherein they will abide forever. And that is easy for God, and nothing is beyond His power.
m-0218	O people, our Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, has come to you with Islam, the religion of truth from your Lord, so believe in him and follow him, for belief in him is best for you. But if you persist in your disbelief, then indeed, God is independent of you and of your faith, for He is the Owner of whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And God is Knowing of your words and actions, Wise in His legislation and command. So if the heavens and the earth have submitted to God Almighty in creation and destiny, as the rest of His kingdom submits, then it is more appropriate for you to believe in God and in His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and in the Qur’an that He revealed to him, and to submit to that in law so that the entire universe will be subject to God in destiny and law. And in this verse is evidence of the universality of the message of God’s Prophet and Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace.
m-0219	O people of the Gospel, do not go beyond the true belief in your religion and do not say about God except the truth, so do not make for Him a wife or a son. The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, is the Messenger of God. God sent him with the truth and created him with the word that He sent Gabriel to Mary, which is His saying, “Be,” and he was. It was a breath from God Almighty that Gabriel breathed by the command of his Lord. So believe that God is One and submit to Him and believe in His messengers in what they brought you from God and act according to it. Do not make Jesus and his mother partners with God. Stop this statement, it is better for you than what you are doing. God is One God, glory be to Him. Whatever is in the heavens and the earth is His. So how can He have a wife or a son from them? God is sufficient as a Disposer of affairs for the management of His creation and the management of their livelihood. So put your trust in Him alone, for He is sufficient for you. The Messiah will not be ashamed or refuse to be a servant of God, and likewise the angels close to Him will not be ashamed or refuse to acknowledge servitude to God Almighty. And whoever is ashamed of submission and obedience and is arrogant, He will gather them all to Him on the Day of Resurrection and He will judge between them with His just judgment and will reward each according to what he deserves.
m-0220	As for those who believed in Allah in belief, word and deed and adhered to His law, He will give them the reward of their deeds and increase them from His grace. As for those who refused to obey Allah and were too proud to submit to Him, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will not find for themselves a protector to save them from His punishment or a helper to support them other than Allah. O people, there has come to you a proof from your Lord, and he is our Messenger Muhammad, and what he brought of clear proofs and decisive arguments, the greatest of which is the Noble Qur’an, which testifies to the truth of his prophethood and his final message. And We have sent down to you the Qur’an as guidance and a clear light. As for those who believed in Allah in belief, word and deed and held fast to the light that was sent down to them, He will admit them to Paradise as a mercy from Him and as a grace, and He will guide them to follow the straight path that leads to the gardens of Paradise.
m-0221	They ask you, O Messenger, about the ruling on the inheritance of kalalah, which is the one who dies without having a son or a father. Say, “Allah makes clear to you the ruling on it. If a man dies without having a son or a father, and he has a sister through his father and mother or through his father only, she shall have half of his estate, and her brother, whether full or paternal, shall inherit all of her property. If she dies without having a son or a father, then if the one who dies kalalah has two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of what he left. And if the male brothers from a different mother are joined with the females, then the male shall have the share of two females from his sisters. Allah makes clear to you the division of inheritance and the ruling on kalalah, lest you go astray from the truth in the matter of inheritance. And Allah is All-Knowing of the consequences of matters and what is in them of good for His servants.”
m-0222	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, fulfill the firm covenants of Allah of belief in the laws of religion and submission to them and fulfill the covenants of one another with regard to trusts and sales and other things that do not contradict the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And Allah has made lawful for you the beasts of livestock, which are camels, cows and sheep, except for what He has made clear to you of the prohibition of dead animals and blood and other things and the prohibition of hunting while you are in a state of ihram. Indeed, Allah judges what He wills according to His wisdom and justice. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not transgress the limits of Allah and His landmarks and do not consider fighting permissible in the sacred months, which are Dhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram and Rajab. This was in the early days of Islam. And do not consider permissible the sanctity of the sacrificial animal or what was garlanded from it, as they used to put necklaces, which are braids of wool or hair, around their necks as a sign that the animal was sacrificial and that the man intended to perform Hajj. And do not consider permissible fighting those intending to go to the Sacred House who seek from the bounty of Allah that which will improve their livelihood and please their Lord. And if You have ended your state of ihram, hunting is permissible for you. Do not let the hatred of a people because they prevented you from reaching the Sacred Mosque, as happened in the year of Hudaybiyyah, lead you to abandon justice towards them. And cooperate, O believers, among yourselves in doing good and fearing God. But do not cooperate in that which involves sin, disobedience, and transgression of the limits set by God. And beware of disobeying the command of God, for He is severe in punishment.
m-0223	Allah has forbidden you the dead animal, which is the animal that dies without being slaughtered. He has forbidden you the flowing blood, the flesh of swine, and that over which other than the name of Allah has been mentioned at the time of slaughter. He has forbidden the strangled animal, which has held its breath until it dies. He has also forbidden the beaten animal, which is the one that has been struck with a stick or stone until it dies. He has also forbidden the gored animal, which has been struck by another with its horn and dies. Allah has forbidden you the animal that has been eaten by a wild animal, such as a lion, tiger, wolf, and the like. He has made an exception from what He has forbidden, the strangled animal and what comes after it. What you have managed to slaughter before it dies is permissible for you. Allah has forbidden you what has been slaughtered for other than Allah on a stone or other than it. Allah has forbidden you to seek knowledge of what has been allotted to you or not by means of arrows, which are the lots that they used to cast lots with when they wanted something before they did it. What is mentioned in the verse is one of the forbidden things if it is committed, going outside the command of Allah and obeying Him to disobeying Him. Now the desire of the infidels for your religion has been cut off. And if you turn away from it to polytheism after I have given you victory over them, then do not fear them but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion, the religion of Islam, by achieving victory and completing the Shariah, and I have completed My favor upon you by bringing you out from the darkness of ignorance into the light of faith, and I have approved for you Islam as religion, so adhere to it and do not depart from it. But whoever is forced by famine to eat carrion and is not inclined intentionally to sin, then he may take it, for indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to him.
m-0224	Your companions ask you, O Prophet, what is lawful for them to eat. Say to them: Lawful for you are the good things and the game of what you have trained of claws and fangs, such as dogs, leopards, falcons, and the like, which you know. You teach them to hunt for you from what Allah has taught you. So eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of Allah when sending them out to hunt. And fear Allah in what He has commanded you and in what He has forbidden you. Indeed, Allah is swift in account. And from the completion of Allah’s favor upon you this day, O believers, is that He has made lawful for you the lawful and good things. And the sacrifices of the Jews and Christians, if they slaughter them according to their law, are lawful for you and your sacrifices are lawful for them. And lawful for you, O believers, is the marriage of chaste women - they are free believing women who are chaste from fornication. And likewise the marriage of chaste free Jews and Christians, if you give them their dowries and are chaste and not committing fornication or taking mistresses and are safe from being influenced by their religion. And whoever denies the laws of faith, his work is in vain, and on the Day of Resurrection he will be among the losers.
m-0225	O you who have believed, when you intend to stand up for prayer and you are not in a state of purity, wash your faces and your hands including the elbows and the elbow joint which is between the upper arm and the forearm, and wipe your heads and wash your feet including the ankles, which are the two prominent bones where the lower leg meets the foot. And if major impurity befalls you, then purify yourselves by washing with it before the prayer. But if you are ill or on a journey while healthy, or one of you has relieved himself or had intercourse with his wife and you do not find water, then strike the ground with your hands and wipe your faces and hands with it. God does not want to make the matter of purification difficult for you, but He permitted dry ablution as an expansion for you and a mercy to you, as He made it an alternative to water for purification. Thus, the permission to perform dry ablution was one of the complete blessings that necessitate thanking the Benefactor by obeying Him in what He has commanded and what He has forbidden.
m-0226	And remember the favor of Allah upon you in what He has prescribed for you, and remember His covenant that He took from you of faith in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and hearing and obedience to them, and fear Allah in what He has commanded you and forbidden you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what you conceal within yourselves. O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, be persistently standing firm for the truth, seeking the countenance of Allah, witnesses to justice, and do not let hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just between enemies and loved ones on an equal level, for that is justice closer to the fear of Allah. And beware of being unjust. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do and will reward you for it.
m-0227	God has promised those who believe in God and His Messenger and do righteous deeds that He will forgive them their sins and reward them for that with Paradise. And God does not fail in His promise. Those who deny the Oneness of God, which indicates the clear truth, and reject the evidence brought by the Messengers, are the people of Hell who will abide therein.
m-0228	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, remember the blessing of security that Allah has bestowed upon you and the terror that has been cast into the hearts of your enemies who wanted to harm you, but Allah turned them away from you and prevented them from doing what they wanted to do to you. And fear Allah and beware of Him and put your trust in Allah alone in your religious and worldly affairs and trust in His help and victory.
m-0229	And Allah took a firm covenant from the Children of Israel that they would worship Him alone, and Allah commanded Moses to appoint twelve overseers over them, equal in number to their branches, to take from them a covenant to hear and obey Allah, His Messenger, and His Book. And Allah said to the Children of Israel, “Indeed, I am with you with My protection and My support. If you establish prayer and give the obligatory zakat to those who are entitled to it and believe in what My messengers have informed you of and support them and spend in My cause, I will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you into gardens beneath whose palaces rivers flow. Whoever among you denies this covenant has indeed deviated from the path of truth to the path of misguidance. Because these Jews broke their firm covenants, We expelled them from Our mercy and made their hearts hard, unyielding to faith. They changed the word of Allah that He revealed to Moses, which is the Torah, and they left a portion of what they were reminded of, so they did not act upon it. And you, O Messenger, will continue to find treachery and deceit from the Jews, for they are on the path of their forefathers, except for a few of them. So pardon their bad treatment of you and forgive them, for Allah loves the one who pardons well.” And forgiveness to those who have wronged him. Thus, the people of deviation find a way to their evil intentions by distorting the words of God and interpreting them in a way other than what they intended. If they are unable to distort and interpret, they abandon what does not agree with their whims from the law of God, which only a few of those whom God has protected from them adhere to.
m-0230	And We took from those who claimed that they were followers of Christ Jesus, and they were not, the firm covenant that We took from the Children of Israel, that they would follow their Messenger, support him, and assist him. But they changed their religion and left a portion of what they were reminded of, and did not act upon it as the Jews did. So We cast among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. And God will inform them of what they used to do on the Day of Reckoning, and He will punish them for their actions.
m-0231	O People of the Book, Jews and Christians, there has come to you Our Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, making clear to you much of what you used to conceal from people, which is in the Torah and the Gospel, and leaving out the explanation of what wisdom does not require. There has come to you from God a light and a clear Book, which is the Noble Qur’an. With this clear Book, God guides those who follow the pleasure of God Almighty to the paths of security and safety, and brings them out by His permission from the darkness of disbelief to the light of faith and guides them to His straight religion. The Christians who say that God is the Messiah, son of Mary, have disbelieved. Say, O Messenger, to these ignorant Christians, if the Messiah were a god, as they claim, he would have been able to avert God’s decree when it came to him, to destroy him and his mother and all those on earth. And the mother of Jesus died, and he could not avert death from her, and likewise he cannot avert death from himself, because they are two servants of God’s servants who are not able to avert destruction from themselves. This is evidence that he is a human being like all the children of Adam, and all beings in the heavens and the earth belong to God, He creates what He wills and brings it into existence, and He is over all things competent. The reality of monotheism requires that God Almighty be unique in the attributes of Lordship and Divinity, so None of His creation shares this with Him, and people often fall into polytheism and misguidance by their exaggeration in the prophets and righteous people, just as the Christians exaggerated in the Christ. The entire universe belongs to God, and creation is in His hand alone. Whatever miracles and signs appear are up to God. He, glory be to Him, creates whatever He wills and does whatever He wants.
m-0232	The Jews and Christians claim that they are the sons of God and His beloved. Say to them, O Messenger, why then does He punish you for your sins? If you were His beloved, He would not punish you. God loves only those who obey Him. Say to them, “Rather, you are created like all the children of Adam. If you do good, you will be rewarded for your goodness, and if you do evil, you will be rewarded for your evil.” God forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. He is the Owner of the kingdom. He disposes of it as He wills, and to Him is the return. He judges between His servants and rewards each according to what he deserves. O Jews and Christians, Our Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, has come to you explaining to you the truth and guidance after a period of time between his sending and the sending of Jesus, son of Mary, lest you say, “No bearer of good tidings or warner has come to us.” You have no excuse after his sending to you. A Messenger has come to you from God giving good tidings to those who believe in him and warning those who disobey Him. God is over all things competent, from the punishment of the disobedient to the reward of the obedient.
m-0233	And remember, O Messenger, when Moses, peace be upon him, said to his people, “O Children of Israel, remember the favor of Allah upon you when He made prophets among you and made you kings who ruled your affairs after you were owned by Pharaoh and his people. He granted you from His favors kinds that He did not grant to anyone in the world of your time. O my people, enter the Holy Land, that is, the purified one, which is Jerusalem and its surroundings, which Allah promised that you would enter and fight the infidels in it, and do not turn back from fighting the tyrants lest you lose the good of this world and the good of the Hereafter.” They said, “O Moses, indeed there are strong and powerful people in it, and we have no power to fight them, and we will not be able to enter it while they are in it. If they leave it, then we will enter.” Two men from among those who feared Allah, upon whom Allah bestowed His favor through obedience to Him and the obedience of His Prophet to the Children of Israel said, “Enter upon these tyrants through the gate of their city, taking the necessary measures. When you enter the gate, you will overcome them. And upon Allah alone, rely, if you believe in what His Messenger has brought you and act according to His law.” The people of Moses said to him, “We will never enter the city as long as The tyrants are therein, so go, you and your Lord, and fight them. As for us, we will sit here and will not fight them. This is their insistence on disobeying Moses, peace be upon him. Moses turned to his Lord, praying, “I have no power except over myself and my brother, so judge between us and the wicked people.” God said to His Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, “The Holy Land is forbidden to these Jews to enter for forty years, wandering in the land, confused. So do not be sorry, Moses, for the people who have disobeyed Me.”
m-0234	And tell, O Messenger, to the Children of Israel the story of the two sons of Adam, Cain and Abel, and it is true news when each of them offered a sacrifice, which is what he would draw closer to God Almighty with. God accepted Abel’s sacrifice because he was pious, and did not accept Cain’s sacrifice because he was not pious. So Cain envied his brother and said, “I will kill you.” Abel replied, “God only accepts from those who fear Him.” And Abel said, admonishing his brother, “If you stretch out your hand against me to kill me, you will not find from me the like of what you did. Indeed, I fear God, the Lord of all creation. Indeed, I want you to return bearing the sin of my killing and your sin that was upon you before that, so you will be among the people of the Fire and its dwellers. That is the recompense of the transgressors.” So it made his soul seem attractive to Cain to kill his brother, so he killed him and became one of the losers who sold their afterlife for their worldly life. When Cain killed his brother, he did not know what to do with his body, so God sent a raven to dig a hole in the ground to bury a dead raven in it to show Cain how to bury his brother’s body. Cain was amazed and said, I was unable to do what this crow did and cover my brother’s nakedness. So Cain buried his brother, and God punished him with regret after he returned with loss.
m-0235	Because of this crime of murder, We have prescribed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul without a reason of retaliation or corruption in the land by any type of corruption that warrants killing, such as polytheism and warfare, it is as if he had killed all of mankind, in what deserves great punishment from Allah. And whoever refrains from killing a soul that Allah has forbidden, it is as if he had saved all of mankind. So preserving the sanctity of one person is preserving the sanctity of all of mankind. And Our messengers came to the Children of Israel with arguments and evidence of the truth of what they called them to of belief in their Lord and performing what was imposed upon them. Then, many of them, after the messengers came to them, transgressed the limits of Allah by committing the prohibitions of Allah and abandoning His commands. The only recompense of those who wage war against Allah and fight Him in hostility and transgress against His rulings and the rulings of His Messenger and spread corruption in the land by killing people and stealing property is that they be killed or crucified. Along with killing and crucifixion, the offender is tied to a cross or the right hand of the combatant is cut off and his left foot. If he does not repent, his left hand and right foot are cut off, or they are exiled to a country other than their own and imprisoned in the prison of that country. Until their repentance is evident. This is the punishment that God has prepared for the warriors: humiliation in this world, and they will have a severe punishment in the Hereafter if they do not repent. But whoever of the warriors comes before you are able to overpower them and comes obediently and repentantly, then what was for God will be dropped from him. So know, O believers, that God is Forgiving to His servants and Merciful to them.
m-0236	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, fear Allah and draw near to Him by obeying Him and doing what pleases Him and strive in His cause so that you may attain His gardens. Indeed, those who have denied the Oneness of Allah and His law, if they owned all that is on the earth and owned as much with it and wanted to ransom themselves on the Day of Resurrection from the punishment of Allah with what they owned, Allah would not accept it from them, and they will have a painful punishment. These disbelievers want to get out of the Fire because of the horrors they will encounter, but they have no way to do so, and they will have an everlasting punishment.
m-0237	"As for the male and female thief, O you who are in authority, cut off their hands in accordance with the Sharia, as a punishment for them for taking people’s money unjustly, and as a punishment by which Allah will prevent others from doing what they did. And Allah is Exalted in His Kingdom, Wise in His command and prohibition. 

So whoever repents after his theft and reforms in all his deeds, then Allah will accept his repentance. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful to them.

Do you not know, O Messenger, that Allah is the Creator of the universe, its Manager and Owner, and that He, the Most High, is the Doer of whatever He wills. He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills, and He is over all things competent."
m-0238	"O Messenger, do not be saddened by those who hasten to deny your prophethood from among the hypocrites who show Islam but their hearts are empty of it, for I will support you against them. And do not be saddened by the Jews’ haste to deny your prophethood, for they are a people who listen to lies and accept what their rabbis fabricate and respond to other people who do not attend your council. These others change the words of Allah after they have understood them and say, “If there comes to you from Muhammad something that agrees with what we have changed and distorted from the rulings of the Torah, then act upon it. But if there comes to you from him something that contradicts it, then beware of accepting it and acting upon it. And whomever Allah wills to go astray, you will not be able, O Messenger, to repel that from him nor will you be able to guide him. And these hypocrites and Jews, Allah did not will to purify their hearts from the filth of disbelief. For them is humiliation and disgrace in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.” These Jews combine listening to lies and eating what is forbidden. So if they come to you seeking judgment, then judge between them or leave them. If you do not judge between them, then they will not be able to harm you at all. And if you judge, then judge between them with justice. God loves the just
The actions of these Jews are strange. They resort to you, O Messenger, and they do not believe in you or in your book, even though the Torah they believe in contains God’s judgment. Then they turn away from your judgment if it does not please them. They have combined disbelief in their law with turning away from your judgment. Those who are described with these qualities are not believers in God, in you, and in what you rule."
m-0239	Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which is guidance from misguidance and clarification of rulings. The prophets who submitted to the ruling of Allah and acknowledged it among the Jews ruled by it and did not deviate from its ruling or distort it. The servants of the Jews and their jurists who raise people with the law of Allah ruled by it. This is because their prophets entrusted them with conveying the Torah and understanding the Book of Allah and acting upon it. The rabbis and scholars were witnesses that their prophets had ruled among the Jews with the Book of Allah. And Allah the Almighty says to the scholars of the Jews and their rabbis: Do not fear the people in carrying out my ruling, for they are not able to benefit you or harm you. But fear Me, for I am the One who benefits and harms. And do not take a small substitute for abandoning the ruling by what I have revealed. Ruling by other than what Allah has revealed is among the deeds of the people of disbelief. So those who change the ruling of Allah that He revealed in His Book, concealing it and denying it and ruling by other than it, believing in its permissibility and permissibility, then those are the disbelievers. And We imposed upon them in the Torah that a life shall be killed for a life, an eye shall be gouged out for an eye, and a nose shall be put out for a nose. The nose is cut off, the ear is cut off for the ear, and the tooth is pulled out for the tooth. And retaliation is to be exacted for wounds. Whoever transgresses his right to retaliate against the aggressor, that is an expiation for some of the sins of the aggressor and a removal of them. And whoever does not rule by what Allah has revealed in retaliation and other matters, then those are the ones who transgress the limits of Allah. And We followed the prophets of the Children of Israel with Jesus, the son of Mary, believing in what is in the Torah, acting according to what is in it, of what His Book has not abrogated. And We revealed to him the Gospel as a guide to the truth and clarifying what people did not know of the ruling of Allah and a witness to the truth of the Torah with what it contains of its rulings. And We have made it an explanation for those who fear Allah and a deterrent for them from committing forbidden things. And let the people of the Gospel to whom Jesus was sent judge by what Allah has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed, then those are the ones who go beyond His command and disobey Him.
m-0240	And We have sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an, and all that is in it is true, testifying to the truth of the books before it and that they are from Allah, confirming what is in them of correctness and clarifying what is in them of distortion, abrogating some of their laws. So judge between those who seek judgment from the Jews by what Allah has sent down to you in this Qur’an, and do not turn away from the truth that Allah has commanded you to their desires and what they have become accustomed to. Indeed, We have made for every nation a law and a clear method by which they should act. And if Allah had willed, He could have made your laws one, but He has made differences between them to test you and show the obedient from the disobedient. So hasten to what is best for you in both worlds by acting according to what is in the Qur’an, for your final destination is to Allah, and He will inform you of what you used to differ over, and He will reward each according to his deeds. And judge, O Messenger, between the Jews by what Allah has sent down to you in the Qur’an, and do not follow the desires of those who seek judgment from you, and beware of them turning you away from some of what Allah has sent down to you, so that you abandon acting according to it. If these people turn away from what you judge by, then know that Allah wants to turn them away from guidance because of sins they have acquired before. And indeed, many people are disobedient to their Lord. Do these Jews want you to judge between them by what is in the Qur’an? The polytheists, the idolaters, have agreed upon the errors and ignorance that cannot be and is never appropriate. Who is more just than God in His judgment for the one who understands God’s law, believes in it, and is certain that God’s judgment is the truth?
m-0241	O you who believe, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies and supporters against the people of faith. That is because they do not have friendship with the believers. The Jews are allies of one another, and so are the Christians. Both parties unite in their enmity towards you. But you, O believers, are more worthy of supporting one another. And whoever among you takes them as allies, then he becomes one of them, and his judgment is their judgment. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoers who take the disbelievers as allies. Allah the Most High informs us about a group of hypocrites who were quick to befriend the Jews because of the doubt and hypocrisy in their hearts, and they said, “We only took them as allies out of fear that they might defeat the Muslims and harm us along with them.” Allah the Most High said, “Perhaps Allah will bring about the conquest, meaning the conquest of Mecca, and support His Prophet and make Islam and the Muslims prevail over the disbelievers, or He will prepare matters that will remove the power of the Jews and the Christians so that they will submit to the Muslims.” Then the hypocrites will regret what they concealed in their souls of their friendship. Then some of the believers will say to each other, astonished at the state of the hypocrites when their affair is exposed, “Are these the ones who swore?” By the most solemn oaths, they have shone. The deeds of the hypocrites that they did in this world are nullified, so they will have no reward for them because they did them without faith, so they lost this world and the Hereafter.
m-0242	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, whoever of you turns back from his religion and replaces it with Judaism or Christianity or something else, they will never harm Allah at all. But Allah will bring forth a people better than them, whom He will love and who will love Him, merciful to the believers, severe against the disbelievers, fighting the enemies of Allah and fearing no one for the sake of Allah. Such is the favor of Allah’s bounty. He gives it to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing in bounty, Knowing who among His servants deserves it. Your supporter, O believers, is only Allah and His Messenger. And the believers are those who maintain the prescribed prayers and pay the zakat willingly and are submissive to Allah. And whoever trusts in Allah and takes Allah, His Messenger, and the believers as allies, then he is of the party of Allah. And the party of Allah are the victorious, the triumphant.
m-0243	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and have acted according to His law, do not take as allies those who mock and toy with your religion from among the People of the Scripture and the disbelievers, and fear Allah if you are believers in Him and His law. And when your muezzin calls to prayer, O believers, the Jews, Christians, and polytheists mock and ridicule your call to it, because of their ignorance of their Lord and because they do not understand the reality of worship.
m-0244	Say, O Messenger, to these mockers from the People of the Book, whatever you find to be a slander or a fault is a praise for us for our belief in God and His revealed books to us and those before us and our belief that most of you are outside the straight path. Say, O Prophet, to the believers, Shall I inform you of those who will be punished on the Day of Resurrection with a punishment more severe than the punishment of these wicked people? They are their ancestors whom God expelled from His mercy and became angry with them and transformed their creation, making them apes and pigs because of their disobedience, their slander and their arrogance, just as there were among them worshippers of the tyrant, and He is pleased with everything that is worshipped besides God. Evil is their place in the Hereafter, and their efforts in this world have gone astray from the right path.
m-0245	"And when the hypocrites of the Jews come to you, O believers, they say, ""We believe,"" while they persist in their disbelief. They entered upon you with their disbelief which they believe in their hearts, then they left while they were persisting in it. And Allah is most knowing of their secrets, even if they show otherwise. And you see, O Messenger, many of the Jews rushing to sins, by telling lies and falsehoods, and transgressing against the rulings of Allah, and consuming people's wealth unjustly. Their deeds and transgressions are evil. Why do not these people who rush into sin and transgression, their imams and scholars, stop telling lies and falsehoods and consuming people's wealth unjustly? Their deeds are evil when they neglect to forbid evil. Allah informs His Prophet of some of the sins of the Jews, and among what they conceal among themselves is that they said, ""The hand of Allah is withheld from doing good deeds. He has been stingy with us in providing for us and in abundance."" That was when drought and famine befell them, their hands were tied, meaning their hands were withheld from doing good deeds, and Allah expelled them from His mercy because of their words. And the matter is not as they invent about their Lord, but His hands are extended, with no restriction upon Him and no obstacle preventing Him from spending, for He The Generous and Noble spends according to wisdom and what is in the interest of the servants. The verse confirms the attribute of the hands of God Almighty as befits Him without likening or specifying, but they will increase in transgression and disbelief because of their hatred and envy because God has chosen you as a messenger. God Almighty informs us that the sects of the Jews will remain until the Day of Resurrection hostile to each other and alienated from each other. Whenever they conspire to plot against the Muslims by stirring up sedition and igniting the fire of war, God will repel their plot and divide them. The Jews will continue to commit sins against God, which will result in corruption and disorder on earth. God Almighty does not love corrupters."
m-0246	And if the Jews and the Christians had believed in Allah and His Messenger and obeyed Allah's commands and avoided His prohibitions, We would have removed from them their sins and admitted them to gardens of pleasure in the Hereafter. And if they had acted according to what is in the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to you, O Messenger, which is the Noble Qur'an, they would have been provided for from every way. So We sent down upon them rain and caused to grow for them fruits. And this is the reward of this world. And indeed, among the People of the Scripture is a moderate party steadfast upon the truth, but many of them have evil deeds and have strayed from the right path.
m-0247	O Messenger, deliver the revelation of Allah which has been sent down to you from your Lord. And if you fall short in conveying it and conceal something of it, then you have not conveyed the message of your Lord. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, conveyed the message of his Lord in full. So whoever claims that he concealed something of what was sent down to him has greatly slandered Allah and His Messenger. And Allah, the Most High, is your protector and supporter against your enemies. You are only responsible for conveying it. Allah does not guide to the right path whoever deviates from the path of truth and denies what you have brought from Allah. Say, O Messenger, to the Jews and Christians, “You have no share in the religion as long as you do not act upon what is in the Torah and the Gospel and what Muhammad brought you of the Qur’an. And indeed, many of the People of the Book, the revelation of the Qur’an to you only increases them in arrogance and denial. They envy you because Allah sent you with this final message in which He explained their faults. So do not grieve, O Messenger, over their denial of you.” Those who believe, and they are the Muslims, the Jews, and the Sabians, who are a people who remain on their nature and do not follow a specific religion, and the Christians, who are the followers of Christ, those among them who believe in Allah with complete faith, which is the oneness of Allah and belief in Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and in what He brought it and believed in the Last Day and did righteous deeds. They will have no fear of the terrors of the Day of Resurrection, nor will they grieve over what they left behind in this world.
m-0248	We took a firm covenant from the Children of Israel in the Torah to hear and obey, and We sent to them Our messengers for this purpose, but they broke what was taken from them of the covenant and followed their own desires. And whenever a messenger came to them from those messengers with what their souls did not desire, they opposed him. So they denied a group of the messengers and killed another group. And these disobedient people thought that God would not punish them for their disobedience and insolence, so they went on in their desires and were blind to guidance so they did not see it, and were deaf to hearing the truth so they did not benefit from it. So God sent down His punishment upon them, so they repented, and God accepted their repentance. Then many of them became blind and deaf after the truth had become clear to them. And God is Seeing of their deeds, the good and the bad, and He will reward them for them.
m-0249	Allah the Almighty swears that those who said that Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary, have disbelieved in this statement of theirs. Allah the Almighty informed that the Messiah said to the Children of Israel, “Worship Allah alone, with no partner for Him. I and you are equal in servitude. Whoever worships other than Him with Allah, Allah has forbidden Paradise to him and made Hell his abode, and he has no helper to save him from it.” Among the Christians, those who said that Allah is the sum of three things, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, have disbelieved. Do these Christians not know that people have only one deity who has not begotten and has not been begotten? If the people who made this statement do not stop their fabrications and lies, they will be afflicted with a painful and painful punishment because of their disbelief in Allah.
m-0250	"Will these Christians not return to Allah the Most High and turn away from what they said and ask Allah the Most High for forgiveness? Allah the Most High is Forgiving of the sins of those who repent and Merciful to them.

The Messiah, son of Mary, peace be upon him, was only a messenger like those who came before him from the messengers, and his mother had confirmed the truth with a firm belief in knowledge and action. They, like other human beings, need food, and he who needs food to live cannot be a god. So, O Messenger, contemplate the state of these infidels. We have explained the signs indicating our oneness and the falsehood of what they claim about the prophets of Allah. Yet, despite that, they go astray from the truth to which We guide them. Then, see how they are diverted from the truth after this explanation.

Say, O Messenger, to these infidels: How do you associate with Allah one who has no power to harm you or bring you any benefit? Allah is the Hearer of the words of His servants, the Knower of their conditions.

Say, O Messenger, to the Christians: Do not exceed the truth in what you believe about the Messiah, and do not follow your desires as the Jews followed their desires in the matter of religion, so they fell into misguidance and led many people to disbelieve in Allah and went out of the path. Straightness to the path of temptation and error"
m-0251	Allah the Almighty informs us that He expelled from His mercy the disbelievers from the Children of Israel in the Book that He sent down to David, peace be upon him, which is the Psalms, and in the Book that He sent down to Jesus, peace be upon him, which is the Gospel, because of their disobedience and transgression against the sacred things of Allah. These Jews were openly committing sins and were pleased with them, and they did not forbid each other from any evil they did. This was one of their bad deeds, and because of it they deserved to be expelled from the mercy of Allah the Almighty. You see, O Messenger, many of these Jews take the polytheists as their allies. Evil is what they did in terms of their allegiance, which was the reason for Allah’s wrath upon them and their eternal torment on the Day of Resurrection. If these Jews who support the polytheists had believed in Allah the Almighty and the Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, and acknowledged what was sent down to him, which is the Noble Qur’an, they would not have taken the disbelievers as friends and supporters. However, many of them are disobedient to Allah and His Messenger.
m-0252	You will find, O Messenger, the most hostile of people to those who believed in you, believed in you, and followed you to be the Jews, because of their stubbornness, denial, and their suppression of the truth, and those who associated others with Allah, such as idol worshippers and others. And you will find the closest of them in affection to the Muslims to be those who say, “We are Christians.” This is because among them are scholars of their religion, ascetics, and worshippers in monasteries, who are devout, and they are humble and do not think it is too proud to accept the truth. These are the ones who accepted the message of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and believed in it. What indicates the closeness of their affection for the Muslims is that when a group of them, the Ethiopian delegation, heard the Qur’an, their eyes overflowed with tears, and they were certain that it was the truth revealed from Allah Almighty. They believed in Allah, followed His Messenger, and beseeched Allah to honor them with the honor of martyrdom with the nation of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, over the nations on the Day of Resurrection. They said, “What blame is there on us for our faith in Allah and our belief in the truth that Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, brought us from Allah, and our following of him? We hope that our Lord will admit us with the people of His obedience into His Paradise on the Day of Resurrection.” So Allah rewarded them for what they said of pride in their belief in Islam and their request to be with the righteous people in gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow, abiding therein, never leaving them nor moving away from them. That is the reward for their good deeds and words. And those who denied the Oneness of Allah and rejected the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and denied His signs revealed to His messengers - those are the companions of the Fire, abiding therein.
m-0253	O you who have believed, do not prohibit the good things which Allah has made lawful to you of food and drink and the marriage of women, restricting what Allah has made easy for you and do not exceed the limits of what Allah has forbidden. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors. And enjoy, O you who believe, the lawful and good things which Allah has given you and bestowed upon you, and fear Allah by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, for your belief in Allah requires you to fear Him and be mindful of Him.
m-0254	Allah will not punish you, O Muslims, for oaths you do not intend to make, such as some of you saying, “No, by Allah” and “Yes, by Allah.” But He will punish you for what you intended to make in your hearts. So if you do not fulfill the oath, then Allah will wipe out the sin of that, because of what you have done before of what Allah has prescribed for you as expiation, such as feeding ten poor people, for each poor person half a sa’ of the average food of the people of the country, or clothing them, for each poor person what is sufficient for clothing according to custom, or freeing a slave from slavery. So the one who swears and does not fulfill his oath has a choice between these three things. Whoever does not find any of those things, then he must fast for three days. These are expiations for not fulfilling your oaths. And guard, O Muslims, your oaths by avoiding swearing, or fulfilling them if you swear, or expiating if you do not fulfill them. And just as Allah has explained to you the ruling on oaths and the release from them, He also explains to you the rulings of His religion so that you may thank Him for guiding you to the straight path.
m-0255	"O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, wine - which is every intoxicant that clouds the mind - and gambling - which includes betting and the like, which involves compensation from both sides and turns away from the remembrance of Allah, and the stone idols - which are the stones at which the polytheists used to slaughter in reverence for them, and what is set up for worship to draw closer to Him, and the arrows - which are the lots with which the disbelievers cast lots before proceeding to do something or refraining from it - indeed, all of that is a sin from the adornment of Satan, so keep away from these sins that you may win Paradise. Satan only wants, by adorning sins to you, to cast between you that which creates enmity and hatred because of drinking wine and gambling, and to distract you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer by losing your mind in drinking wine and being occupied with the amusement of gambling, so desist from that. And comply, O Muslims, with the obedience of Allah and the obedience of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in everything you do and leave, and fear Allah and be mindful of that. If you turn away from compliance and do what you have been forbidden from, then know that it is only upon you Our Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, the clear message
There is no sin on the believers who drank alcohol before it was forbidden if they stopped it and feared God’s wrath and believed in Him and presented righteous deeds that indicate their faith and their desire for God Almighty’s pleasure with them, then they increased in their observance of God Almighty and their faith in Him until they became, out of their certainty, worshipping Him as if they saw Him. And God Almighty loves those who have reached the level of ihsan until their faith in the unseen became like seeing Him."
m-0256	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, Allah will surely test you with something of the game that will approach you in an unusual way, where you can take its young ones without a weapon and take its adults with a weapon, so that Allah may know with clear knowledge those who fear their Lord in the unseen, for their certainty of His perfect knowledge of them, by restraining them from hunting while they are in a state of ihram. Whoever exceeds His limit after this clarification and proceeds to hunt while in a state of ihram, then he deserves a severe punishment. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not kill game of the land while you are in a state of ihram for Hajj or Umrah or while you are inside the sanctuary. And whoever kills any kind of game of the land intentionally, the penalty for that is to slaughter the like of that game from the livestock, camels, cows or sheep, after two just men have estimated it, and to give it as a gift to the poor of the sanctuary, or to buy food for its value and give it as a gift to the poor of the sanctuary, for every poor person half a saa’, or to fast instead of that one day for every half saa’ of that food. Allah has imposed this penalty on him so that he may receive the punishment mentioned, the consequence of his action. And those who have fallen into something of This was before the prohibition, for God Almighty has forgiven them. Whoever returns to disobedience deliberately after the prohibition is exposed to God’s vengeance against him. God Almighty is Mighty, Strong, and Invincible in His authority, and part of His might is that He takes revenge on whoever disobeys Him if He wills, and nothing can prevent Him from doing so.
m-0257	"Allah has made lawful for you, O Muslims, while in a state of ihram, to hunt in the sea, which is what is caught alive, and to eat it, which is dead, for your benefit, whether you are residents or travelers. He has forbidden you to hunt on land as long as you are in a state of ihram for Hajj or Umrah. Fear Allah and carry out all His commands and avoid all His prohibitions so that you may attain His great reward and be saved from His painful punishment when you are gathered for the reckoning and recompense. Allah has bestowed His favor upon His servants by making the Kaaba, the Sacred House, a means of improvement for their religion and a means of security for their lives, as they believed in Allah and His Messenger and performed His obligations. He has forbidden aggression and fighting in the sacred months, which are Dhul-Qi'dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab, so that no one may attack another in them. He has also forbidden aggression against what is offered to the Sacred Sanctuary from the livestock, and He has also forbidden aggression against necklaces, which are what is hung on the adornment, indicating that it is intended for ritual purposes. This is so that you may know that Allah knows everything in the heavens and the earth, including what He has prescribed to protect His creation from one another, and that Allah is All-Knowing of everything, and nothing is hidden from Him. Hidden
Know, O people, that Allah, the Almighty, is severe in punishment for those who disobey Him, and that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to those who repent and return
Allah Almighty explains that the mission of His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is guidance, direction, and communication, and that guidance and success are in Allah’s hand alone, and that what people’s souls conceal, whether they conceal or declare, of guidance or misguidance, Allah knows
Say, O Messenger, the evil and the good are not equal in everything. The disbeliever is not equal to the believer, the sinner is not equal to the obedient, the ignorant is not equal to the scholar, the innovator is not equal to the follower, and unlawful money is not equal to the lawful, even if the abundance of evil and the number of its people impress you, O human being. Fear Allah, O people of sound minds, by avoiding evil and doing good things so that you may succeed in attaining the greatest goal, which is the pleasure of Allah Almighty and winning Paradise."
m-0258	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not ask about matters of religion for which you have not been commanded to do anything, such as asking about matters that have not occurred or which entail strict religious obligations. If you were charged with them, they would be difficult for you. If you were to ask about them during the life of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and when the Qur’an was revealed to him, they would be made clear to you. And if you were charged with them, you would be unable to do them. Allah left them, exempting His servants from them. Allah is Forgiving to His servants when they repent, Forbearing toward them, and He does not punish them when they turn to Him. Indeed, people before you asked their messengers questions, but when they were commanded to do them, they denied them and did not carry them out. So beware of being like them.
m-0259	What Allah has prescribed for the polytheists is what they have innovated in the livestock of not benefiting from some of them and making them for idols, which is the Bahira whose ear is cut off if it gives birth to a number of wombs, and the Sa’ibah which is left for idols, and the Wasilah which is the one whose birth is connected to one female after another, and the Hami which is the male camel if a number of camels are born from his loins, but the infidels attributed that to Allah the Most High, slandering Him, and most of the infidels do not distinguish truth from falsehood. And when it is said to these infidels who forbid what Allah has made lawful, come to the revelation of Allah and to His Messenger so that what is lawful and what is unlawful may become clear to you, they say, what we have inherited from our fathers of speech and action is sufficient for us. Would they say that even if their fathers did not know anything? That is, they do not understand the truth, nor do they know it, nor are they guided to it. So how can they follow them in this case, for none follows them except those who are more ignorant than them and more astray in their path? O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, oblige yourselves to act in obedience to Allah and avoid disobeying Him, and continue to do so even if people do not respond to you, then if You did that, so the straying of those who went astray will not harm you if you adhere to the path of righteousness, enjoin what is right, and forbid what is wrong. To God is your return all together in the Hereafter, and He will inform you of your deeds and reward you for them.
m-0260	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, when death approaches any of you, let two trustworthy witnesses from among the Muslims, or two others from among the non-Muslims in case of need and there are no other two from among the Muslims to witness them if you are traveling in the land and death befalls you. But if you doubt their testimony, then stop them after the prayer - meaning the prayer of the Muslims, especially the afternoon prayer - and let them swear by Allah a sincere oath, not taking any worldly reward for it, nor showing favoritism to any of their relatives, nor concealing it, as a testimony to Allah before them, and that if they do that, then they are among the sinners. If the heirs of the deceased find out that the two witnesses mentioned have sinned by betraying their testimony or will, then let two of the heirs of the deceased take their place in the testimony and swear by Allah, “Our truthful testimony is more worthy of acceptance than their false testimony, and we have not exceeded the truth in our testimony. If we transgress and bear witness to something other than the truth, then we are among the wrongdoers who transgress the limits of Allah.” That is the ruling when there is doubt about the two witnesses, from the oath after the prayer and not accepting their testimony is closer to them coming to testify against Its reality is fear of the punishment of the Hereafter or fear that the false oath will be rejected by the people of truth after they swear, so the liar whose oath was rejected will be exposed in this world at the time when his betrayal becomes apparent. And fear God, O people, and be mindful of Him lest you swear falsely and seize unlawful wealth with your oaths. And listen to what you are admonished with, for God does not guide the wicked people who go beyond His obedience.
m-0261	And remember, O people, the Day of Resurrection, the day when God will gather the messengers, peace be upon them, and ask them about the response of their nations to them when they called them to monotheism. They will answer, “We have no knowledge, for we do not know what is in the hearts of people, nor what they innovated after us. Indeed, You are the Knower of everything, apparent and hidden.”
m-0262	When God said on the Day of Resurrection, “O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor upon you when I created you without a father, and upon your mother when I chose her over the women of the worlds and cleared her of what was attributed to her.” Among these favors upon Jesus is that He strengthened him and helped him with Gabriel, peace be upon him, to speak to people while he was an infant and call them to God while he was an adult, with what God revealed to him of monotheism. Among them is that God Almighty taught him writing and calligraphy without a teacher and gave him the power of understanding and perception and taught him the Torah that He sent down to Moses, peace be upon him, and the Gospel that He sent down to him as guidance for the people. Among these favors is that he is shaped from clay in the form of a bird, then he breathes into that form and it becomes a bird with God’s permission. Among them is that he heals the one who was born blind so that he sees and heals the leper so that his skin returns healthy with God’s permission. Among them is that he calls upon God to revive the dead so that they rise from their graves alive. All of this is by God Almighty’s will and permission. These are dazzling miracles that support the prophethood of Jesus, peace be upon him. Then God Almighty reminds him of His favor upon him when he prevented the Children of Israel when they intended to kill him and he came to them with clear miracles. And remember My favor upon you when I inspired and cast into the hearts of a group of your chosen ones that they should believe in the Oneness of God Almighty and your prophethood. They said, “We have believed, O our Lord, and bear witness that we are submissive to You and obedient to Your command.”
m-0263	And remember when the disciples said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table spread of food from the heaven if you ask Him?” His answer was that He commanded them to fear the punishment of Allah, the Most High, if they are true believers. The disciples said, “We want to eat from the table and have our hearts at peace with seeing it and know with certainty the truthfulness of your prophethood and to be among the witnesses to this verse that Allah sent it down as an argument for us regarding His Oneness and His ability to do whatever He wills and an argument for you regarding the truthfulness of your prophethood.” Jesus, son of Mary, answered the disciples’ request and called upon his Lord, the Most High, saying, “Our Lord, send down to us a table spread of food from the heaven so that we may take the day of its descent as a festival for us and those who come after us to glorify it, and so that the table may be a sign and an argument from You, O Allah, regarding Your Oneness and the truthfulness of my prophethood, and grant us from Your abundant gifts, for You are the best of providers.” Allah, the Most High, said, “Indeed, I will send down the table spread of food to you. So whoever among you denies My Oneness and the prophethood of Jesus, peace be upon him, after the table has been sent down, I will punish him with a severe punishment such as I have not punished anyone in the worlds.” The table has been sent down as God's promise
m-0264	And remember when Allah the Most High said on the Day of Resurrection, “O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Make me and my mother gods instead of Allah?’” Jesus answered, “Allah is far removed from me. It is not right for me to say to the people other than the truth. If I said this, then You know it, for nothing is hidden from You. You know what my soul conceals, and I do not know what is in Your soul. Indeed, You are the Knower of everything that is apparent or hidden.” Jesus, peace be upon him, said, “O my Lord, I only said to them what You revealed to me and commanded me to convey, regarding You alone in monotheism and worship. I was a witness over what they did while I was among them, and over their actions and words. Then, when You fulfilled my term on earth and raised me up to heaven alive, You were the One who knows their secrets, and You are a Witness over all things. Nothing is hidden from You on earth or in heaven.” Indeed, O Allah, if You punish them, they are Your servants, and You are the Most Knowing of their conditions. You do with them what You will with Your justice. And if You forgive with Your mercy those of them who come with the means of forgiveness, then You are the Exalted in Might who cannot be overcome. The Wise in His management and command. This verse is praise of Allah the Most High for His wisdom, justice, and perfect knowledge. Allah the Most High said, For Jesus, peace be upon him, on the Day of Resurrection, this is the Day of Recompense that will benefit the monotheists, their monotheism of their Lord, their submission to His law, and their sincerity in their intentions, words, and deeds. For them are gardens beneath whose palaces rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. May God be pleased with them, so He accepted their good deeds and they were pleased with Him for what He gave them of His abundant reward. That is the reward, and His pleasure with them is the great attainment. To God alone, with no partner, is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them. He, glory be to Him, is over all things competent. Nothing is beyond His power.
m-0265	Praise be to Allah for His attributes, all of which are descriptions of perfection, and for His apparent and hidden blessings, religious and worldly, who created the heavens and the earth and what is in them, and created darkness and light, by alternating night and day. This is evidence of the greatness of Allah Almighty and that He alone deserves worship, so no one may associate anyone with Him. Despite this clarity, the disbelievers equate anyone with Allah and associate others with Him. He is the One who created your father Adam from clay, and you are his descendants. Then He wrote the duration of your stay in this worldly life, and He wrote another specific term that no one knows except Him, the Most High, which is the Day of Resurrection. Then after this, you doubt the ability of Allah Almighty to resurrect after death. Allah, the Most High, is the God who is worshipped in the heavens and the earth, and among the evidence of His divinity is that He knows everything that you conceal, O people, and what you declare, and He knows all your deeds, whether good or evil. For this reason, He, the Most High, is the only God who deserves worship.
m-0266	These infidels who associate others with Allah have received clear proofs and clear evidence of the Oneness of Allah, the Most High, and the truthfulness of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in his prophethood and what he brought, but as soon as they came to them, they turned away from accepting them and did not believe in them. These infidels denied the truth that Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, brought to them and mocked his call out of ignorance of Allah and deceit by His giving them respite. They will see that what they mocked is the truth and the honesty. Allah will make clear to the deniers their lies and fabrications and will punish them for it. Didn’t these people who deny the Oneness of Allah, the Most High, and that He alone deserves to be worshipped and who disbelieve in His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, know what happened to the nations who denied before them of destruction and devastation? We empowered them on earth as We did not empower you, O disbelievers. We bestowed upon them the rain and the rivers flowing from beneath their dwellings as a lure and a respite for them. But they disbelieved in the blessings of Allah and disbelieved in the Messengers, so We destroyed them because of their sins and created after them Other nations succeeded them in developing the earth. Even if We had sent down to you, O Messenger, a book from the heaven in pages and these polytheists touched it with their hands, they would have said, “Indeed, what you have brought, O Messenger, is obvious magic.”
m-0267	These polytheists said, “Why did Allah not send down an angel from the heaven to Muhammad to confirm what he brought of prophethood?” And if We had sent down an angel from the heaven in response to their request, the matter would have been decided for their destruction, and they would not have been given respite to repent. It was already known to Allah that they would not believe. And if We had made the messenger sent to them an angel, since they were not convinced by Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, We would have made that angel in the form of a human being so that they could hear from him and speak to him, since they are not able to see the angel in his angelic form. And if the angel had come to them in the form of a man, the matter would have been confused for them as the matter of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was confused for them. And since their request to send down the angel was to mock Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, Allah Almighty explained to them that mocking the messengers, peace be upon them, is not a new matter, but rather it had happened from the previous disbelievers with their prophets, and the punishment that they mocked and denied had surrounded them. Say to them, O Messenger, travel in the land and see how Allah has followed the deniers with destruction and disgrace, so beware of the like of their deaths and fear that the like of what happened to them will happen to you.
m-0268	"Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists: Who owns the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them? Say, “It belongs to Allah, as you acknowledge and know, so worship Him alone. Allah has decreed mercy upon Himself, so He will not hasten punishment upon His servants. He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt, for reckoning and recompense.” Those who associate others with Allah have destroyed themselves, for they do not believe in the Oneness of Allah, nor do they believe in His promise and His threat, nor do they acknowledge the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. To Allah belongs the dominion of everything in the heavens and the earth, whether it is still or moving, hidden or apparent. All are His servants and creation, and are under His control, control, and management. He is the All-Hearer of the words of His servants, the Forbearing of their movements and their secrets. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists with Allah, the Most High: Should I take someone other than Allah, the Most High, as a protector and helper, while He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them, and He is the One who provides for His creation, while no one provides for Him? Say, O Messenger, I have been commanded to be the first of this nation to submit and obey Him in servitude, and I have been forbidden to be among those who associate others with Him. Say, O Messenger, to these people: Associating others with Allah, I fear that if I disobey my Lord and go against His command and associate others with Him in His worship, a great punishment will descend upon me on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever Allah averts that severe punishment from, He has shown mercy to him, and that aversion is the clear victory of salvation from the great punishment. 

And if Allah afflicts you, O human, with something that harms you, such as poverty and sickness, none can remove it but Him. And if He afflicts you with good, such as wealth and health, none can repel His favor or prevent His decree, for He, the Most High, is Able to do all things. 

And Allah, the Most High, is the Victorious, the Dominant over His servants. Necks have submitted to Him and tyrants have humbled themselves before Him. He is the Wise, who places things in their proper places according to His wisdom, the All-Knowing, from whom nothing is hidden. Whoever is characterized by these qualities must not associate others with Him. In this verse, there is proof of the superiority of Allah, the Most High, over all of His creation, an absolute superiority befitting His Majesty, the Most High."
m-0269	Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, what is the greatest testimony to prove my truthfulness in what I have told you that I am the Messenger of Allah? Say, “Allah is witness between me and you,” meaning, He knows what I have brought to you and what you are saying to me. And Allah has revealed this Qur’an to me so that I may warn you thereby of His punishment that will befall you and warn thereby whoever reaches it from the nations. Indeed, you acknowledge that there are other deities with Allah that you associate with Him. Say to them, O Messenger, “I do not bear witness to what you have acknowledged. Allah is only One God, with no partner, and I am innocent of every partner that you worship along with Him.” Those to whom We gave the Torah and the Gospel know Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, by his attributes written with them as they know their own sons. Just as their sons are not confused with others before them, so Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is not confused with others due to the precision of his description in their books. But they followed their desires and lost themselves when they disbelieved in Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and what he brought. No one is more unjust than someone who tells a lie about Allah, the Most High, and claims that He has partners in worship or claims that He has a son or The owner or the liar with his proofs and evidence with which he supported his messengers, peace be upon them, that the wrongdoers who fabricated lies against God will not succeed, nor will they achieve their demands in this world or in the Hereafter.
m-0270	And let these polytheists who deny the signs of Allah beware of the Day when We will gather them and then say to them, “Where are your gods whom you claimed to be partners with Allah, so that they might intercede for you?” Then their only response when they were tested and tried by asking about their partners was to disavow them and swear by Allah, their Lord, that they did not associate anything with Allah except Him. Consider, O Messenger, how these polytheists lied to themselves while in the Hereafter they have disavowed polytheism and what they thought of as the intercession of their gods has gone and disappeared from them. Among these polytheists are those who listen to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an, but it does not reach their hearts because because of their following their desires, We have placed coverings over their hearts so that they do not understand the Qur’an, and We have placed in their ears heaviness and deafness so that they do not hear or comprehend anything. And if they see the many signs that prove the truth of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, they will not believe in them until, when they come to you, O Messenger, after witnessing the signs that prove your truthfulness, they dispute with you. Those who denied the signs of Allah say, “This that we hear is nothing but what The ancients transmitted it as tales that have no truth. These polytheists forbid people from following Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and from listening to him, and they distance themselves from him. They do not destroy themselves by preventing people from the path of God except themselves, and they do not feel that they are working to destroy themselves.
m-0271	And if you could see, O Messenger, these polytheists on the Day of Resurrection, you would see a great matter. That is when they are detained in the Fire and see what is in it of chains and shackles and they see with their own eyes those great matters and horrors. Then they will say, “Oh, would that we were returned to the life of this world so we would believe in the signs of Allah and act upon them and be among the believers.” This is not the case, but what they knew about themselves in themselves of the truth of what the Messengers brought in this world will become clear to them on the Day of Resurrection, even though they appeared to their followers to be otherwise. If it were assumed that they were returned to this world and given a respite, they would return to their stubbornness with disbelief and denial. Indeed, they are liars in their statement, “If we were returned to this world, we would not deny the signs of our Lord and would be among the believers.” And these polytheists who deny the Resurrection will say, “What is life except this life that we are in, and we will not be resurrected after our death.” And if you could see, O Messenger, those who deny the Resurrection when they are detained before Allah the Most High for His judgment on them on the Day of Resurrection, you would see the worst state when Allah the Almighty says, “Is this not the truth?” That is, is this Resurrection that you denied in this world the truth? They will say, “Yes, by our Lord.” It is the truth. Allah the Most High said: “So taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve.” That is, the punishment that you used to deny in this world because of your denial of Allah the Most High and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The disbelievers who denied the resurrection after death have lost, until when the Day of Resurrection comes and they are surprised by the evil fate, they call upon themselves with regret for what they wasted in their worldly life while they carry their sins on their backs. How bad are the heavy, bad burdens that they carry. The worldly life in most cases is nothing but delusion and vanity. And righteous deeds for the Hereafter are better for those who fear Allah and guard against His punishment by obeying Him and avoiding His disobedience. Do you not understand, O polytheists who are deceived by the adornments of the worldly life, so they prefer what remains over what perishes.
m-0272	"Indeed, We know that your people’s outward denial of you saddens your heart, so be patient and be reassured, for they do not deny you in their hearts, but rather believe in your truthfulness. However, due to their injustice and aggression, they deny the clear proofs of your truthfulness, so they deny you in what you have brought.

And the disbelievers have denied messengers before you whom Allah sent to their nations, and they were harmed in His cause, but they were patient in that and continued in their call and their struggle until Allah’s victory came to them. And there is no changing the words of Allah, which are what He revealed to His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, of His promise to him of victory over those who oppose Him. And there has come to you, O Messenger, news of those who came before you from the messengers and what was realized for them of Allah’s victory and what happened to those who denied them of Allah’s wrath and anger against them, so you have in those messengers who came before you an example and a model, and in this there is consolation for the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

And if the aversion of these polytheists and their turning away from responding to your call is difficult for you, O Messenger, then if you can make a tunnel in the ground or an elevator to ascend in it To the sky, and bring them a sign and proof of the truth of your statement, other than what we have brought them. So do so. If God had willed, He would have gathered them on the guidance that you are on and guided them to faith, but He did not will that for a reason that He knows, glory be to Him. So do not be, O Messenger, among the ignorant ones whose grief and regret have become intense until that has led them to extreme impatience."
m-0273	"Only those who listen to the word with acceptance will respond to you, O Messenger, to the guidance you have called to. As for the disbelievers, they are among the dead, because true life is only through Islam. The dead are brought out of their graves by Allah, and then they return to Him on the Day of Resurrection to be given their account and their reward. The polytheists say, out of arrogance and haughtiness, “Why did Allah not send down a sign that would indicate the truthfulness of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from the type of miraculous signs?” Tell them, O Messenger, that Allah is able to send down a sign to them, but most of them do not know that sending down signs is only according to His wisdom. There is no animal on earth that creeps on the ground or a bird that flies in the sky with its wings except that they are groups of homogeneous creation like you. We have not left anything in the Preserved Tablet except that We have recorded it. Then they will be gathered to their Lord on the Day of Resurrection, and Allah will hold each one accountable for what he has done. Those who deny the proofs of Allah are deaf; they do not hear what benefits them because of you. They do not speak the truth, so they are lost in the darkness. They have not chosen the path of righteousness. Whoever Allah wills to misguide, He misguides him, and whoever He wills to guide, He places him on the path of righteousness. Straight Path
Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, tell me, if the punishment of Allah comes to you in this world, or the Hour comes to you in which you will be resurrected, is it other than Allah that you will call upon there to remove the affliction that has befallen you, if you are right in your claim that the gods you worship besides Allah can benefit or harm

Rather, you will call upon your Lord there who created you, and none other than Him, and you will seek help from Him, so that He may relieve you of the great affliction that has befallen you, if He wills, for He is capable of all things. Then you will abandon your idols, your statues, and your allies."
m-0274	"And We sent, O Messenger, to groups of people before you messengers calling them to Allah the Most High, but they denied them, so We tested them in their wealth with severe poverty and hardship of living, and We tested them in their bodies with diseases and pains, hoping that they would humble themselves before their Lord and submit to Him alone in worship.

So why, when Our trial came to these nations who denied, did they not humble themselves before Us? But their hearts hardened, and Satan made attractive to them what they were doing of sins and committing of polytheism.

So when they abandoned working with the commands of Allah the Most High, turning away from them, We opened to them the doors of every kind of provision, so We replaced their hardship with ease in life, and their hardship with health in bodies, as a lure from Us to them, until when they became arrogant and proud of what We had given them of goodness and blessings, We seized them suddenly with punishment, and at once they were despairing, cut off from every good.

So these people were uprooted and destroyed because they disbelieved in Allah and denied His messengers, so not one of them remained. Thanks and praise be to Allah the Most High, the Creator and Owner of everything, for the victory of His friends and the destruction of His enemies."
m-0275	Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, tell me: If Allah takes away your hearing and makes you deaf, and takes away your sight and blinds you, and seals your hearts so that you no longer understand a word, which god other than Allah, the Most High, is able to return that to you? Look, O Messenger, how We give them various arguments, and then they turn away from remembrance and consideration. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, tell me: If Allah’s punishment descends upon you suddenly while you are not aware of it, or is apparent and visible while you are looking at it, will anyone be destroyed except the wrongdoing people who transgressed the limit by diverting worship to other than Allah, the Most High, and by denying His messengers? We do not send Our messengers except as bearers of good tidings to those who obey Us of eternal bliss and as warnings to those who disobey Us of painful torment. So whoever believes and believes in the messengers and does righteousness - those will have no fear when meeting their Lord, nor will they grieve over anything they have missed of the worldly fortunes. And those who deny Our signs of the Qur’an and miracles - those will be afflicted with torment on the Day of Resurrection because of their disbelief and their departure from the obedience of Allah, the Most High. Say, O Messenger, To these polytheists, I do not claim that I own the treasures of the heavens and the earth so that I can dispose of them, nor do I claim that I know the unseen, nor do I claim that I am an angel. Rather, I am a messenger from God. I follow what is revealed to me and convey His revelation to the people. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, is the disbeliever who is blind to the signs of God Almighty and does not believe in them equal to the believer who sees the signs of God and believes in them? Then do you not reflect on the signs of God so that you may see the truth and believe in it?
m-0276	And frighten, O Prophet, with the Qur’an those who know that they will be gathered to their Lord, for they believe in the promise and threat of Allah. They have no protector but Allah to support them, nor any intercessor to intercede for them with Him, the Most High, to save them from His punishment, so that they may fear Allah, the Most High, by doing what He commands and avoiding what He prohibits. And do not keep away from your company the weak Muslims who worship their Lord at the beginning and end of the day, seeking the face of Allah with their righteous deeds. You are not responsible for the accountability of these poor people at all. Their accountability is with Allah, and they have nothing to do with your accountability. If you keep them away, then you will be among those who transgress the limits of Allah, who put things in the wrong place.
m-0277	And likewise Allah the Almighty has tested some of His servants with others by varying their fortunes in terms of provisions and morals, so He made some of them rich and some of them poor, some of them strong and some of them weak, so He made some of them need others as a test from Him for them so that the disbelievers who are rich would say, “Are these the weak ones whom Allah has bestowed guidance to Islam from among us?” Is not Allah the Almighty more knowledgeable about those who are grateful for His blessings and guides them to guidance to His religion? And when those who have believed in the verses of Allah that testify to your truthfulness from the Qur’an and other than it come to you asking about repentance from their previous sins, then honor them by returning their greetings and give them good tidings of Allah’s vast mercy, for He, the Almighty, has written upon Himself mercy for His servants as a favor, for whoever commits a sin out of ignorance of its consequences and its necessitating Allah’s wrath, then every disobedient person to Allah, whether by mistake or intentionally, is ignorant of this consideration, even if he was aware of the prohibition and then repented after that and continued to do righteous deeds, for Allah the Almighty forgives his sin, for He is Forgiving to His repentant servants, Merciful to them. And such a statement is like that which We have made it clear to you, O Messenger. We have made clear the proofs for every truth that the people of falsehood deny, so that the truth may be made clear and the path of the people of falsehood who oppose the Messengers may be made clear. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, “Allah, the Almighty, has forbidden me to worship the idols that you worship besides Him.” And say to them, “I do not follow your desires. I have strayed from the straight path if I follow your desires, and I am not of the guided ones.” Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, “I have clear insight into the law of Allah that He revealed to me, which is to single Him out for worship alone. You have denied this, and it is not in my power to send down the punishment that you are hastening. The judgment in delaying that is only up to Allah, the Most High. He relates the truth, and He is the best to judge between truth and falsehood with His judgment and decree.” Say, O Messenger, “If I had the power to send down the punishment that you are hastening, I would have sent it down to you, and the matter would have been decided between me and you. But that is up to Allah, the Most High, and He is most knowing of the wrongdoers who have transgressed their limits and associated others with Him.”
m-0278	And God Almighty has the keys to the unseen, any treasures of the unseen that only He knows, including the knowledge of the hour and the descent of rain and what is in the wombs and gain in the future and the place of human death and knows everything in the land and sea There is a clear book that is The preserved plate
m-0279	And He, glory be to Him, is the One who takes your souls at night in a manner similar to the taking of them at death, and He knows what you have earned during the day of deeds, then He returns your souls to your bodies when you wake up from sleep during the day in a manner similar to the living after death, so that your appointed terms in this world may be fulfilled. Then to Allah, glory be to Him, is your return after He raises you from your graves alive. Then He informs you of what you used to do in your worldly life, then He rewards you for that. And Allah, glory be to Him, is the Supreme over His servants, an absolute superiority in every respect befitting His Majesty, glory be to Him. Everything is subject to His Majesty and Greatness. And He sends angels to His servants who preserve and count their deeds until, when death descends upon one of them, the Angel of Death and his helpers take his soul, and they do not waste what they were commanded to do. Then these deceased people are returned to Allah, glory be to Him, their true Master. Is not His the judgment and the decision on the Day of Resurrection between His servants? And He is the Swiftest of reckoners.
m-0280	Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, who can save you from the fears of the darkness of the land and sea? Is it not Allah, the Most High, whom you call upon in times of distress, humbly and secretly, saying, “If our Lord should save us from these fears, we will surely be among the grateful ones by worshipping Him, the Almighty, the Majestic, alone, without partner.” Say to them, O Messenger, Allah alone is the One who can save you from these fears and from every hardship. Then you associate others with Him in worship. Say, O Messenger, Allah, the Almighty, the Majestic, is the only One who can send upon you a punishment from above you, such as stoning or a flood or the like, or from beneath your feet, such as earthquakes and subsidence, or confuse your affair so that you become warring factions, killing one another. Look, O Messenger, how we diversify our clear arguments to these polytheists, so that they may understand and take heed. The disbelievers among your people have denied this Qur’an, O Messenger, and it is the truthful Book in all that it has brought. Say to them, “I am not a guardian or a watcher over you, but I am only the Messenger of Allah, conveying to you what I have been sent with.” Every piece of news has a decision that settles with it and an end to which it reaches. The truth will be distinguished from falsehood, and you, O disbelievers, will know the consequences of your actions when God’s punishment befalls you.
m-0281	And if you see, O Messenger, the polytheists who speak falsely and mockingly about the verses of the Qur’an, then stay away from them until they start talking about something else. And if Satan makes you forget this matter, then do not sit after remembering it with the transgressing people who spoke falsely about the verses of Allah. And there is nothing upon the believers who fear Allah, the Most High, and obey His commands and avoid His prohibitions from Allah’s reckoning of the ignorant and mockers of the verses of Allah, but they should admonish them so that they may refrain from that false speech that they may fear Allah, the Most High. And leave, O Messenger, these polytheists who have made the religion of Islam a game and a diversion, mocking the verses of Allah, and the worldly life with its adornments has deceived them. And remind these polytheists and others with the Qur’an so that no soul will be held hostage by its sins and disbelief in its Lord, for it has no helper but Allah to help it and save it from His punishment, nor any intercessor to intercede for it with Him. And if you ransom yourself with any ransom, it will not be accepted from you. Those are the ones who are held hostage by their sins. For them in the Fire is a drink of intense heat and a painful torment because of their disbelief in Allah, the Most High, and His Messenger Muhammad. May God bless him and the religion of Islam
m-0282	Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists: Shall we worship, besides Allah, idols that neither benefit nor harm, and return to disbelief after Allah has guided us to Islam? So that we are like one whose mind has been corrupted by the temptations of the devils? He has merit on earth and has wise, believing companions who call him to the right path that they are on, but he refuses. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists: Verily, the guidance of Allah with which He sent me is the true guidance, and He has commanded us all to submit to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, by worshipping Him alone, without any partner for Him, for He is the Lord of everything and its Owner. Likewise, He has commanded us to establish the prayer completely and to fear Him by doing what He commands and avoiding what He prohibits. He, the Most High, is the One to whom all creation will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah, the Most High, is the One who created the heavens and the earth in truth. And remember, O Messenger, on the Day of Resurrection when Allah says, “Be,” and it is, from His command, as in the blink of an eye, or even closer. His saying is the complete truth, and His is the kingdom, glory be to Him alone, on the day when the angel blows the horn, the second blast, by which the souls will return to the bodies. He, glory be to Him, is the One who knows what is hidden from Your senses, O people, and what you see, and He is the Wise One who puts things in their proper places, the Expert in the affairs of His creation, and God Almighty is the One who is concerned with these matters and others, beginning and end, creation and destiny, and He alone is the One to whom the servants must submit to His law, surrender to His judgment, and aspire to His pleasure and forgiveness.
m-0283	"And remember, O Messenger, the argument of Abraham, peace be upon him, with his father Azar, when he said to him, ""Do you make idols as gods to worship besides God? Indeed, I see you and your people in clear error from the path of truth."" And just as We guided Abraham, peace be upon him, to the truth in the matter of worship, We showed him what the heavens and the earth contain of a great kingdom and dazzling power, so that he might be among those firmly rooted in faith. So when the night became dark for Abraham, peace be upon him, and the overseer of his people covered him to prove to them that their religion was false and that they were worshipping the stars, Abraham, peace be upon him, saw a planet and said, luring his people to oblige them to monotheism, ""This is my Lord."" When the planet set, he said, ""I do not like gods that set."" So when Abraham saw the moon rising, he said to his people, by way of luring the opponent, ""This is my Lord."" When it set, he said, needing the guidance of his Lord, ""If my Lord does not guide me to the right path in monotheism, I will surely be among the people who have gone astray from the right path by worshipping other than God Almighty."" So when he saw the sun rising, he said to his people, ""This is my Lord. This is greater than the planet and the moon."" So when Absent, he said to his people, ""I am innocent of what you associate with God, of worshipping idols, stars, and statues that you worship instead of God Almighty. I have turned my face in worship to God Almighty alone, for He is the One who created the heavens and the earth, inclining from polytheism to monotheism, and I am not of those who associate with God other than Him."""
m-0284	And his people argued with him about the oneness of God Almighty. He said: Do you argue with me about my belief in the oneness of God in worship while He has guided me to the knowledge of His oneness? If you are threatening me with your gods lest they cause me harm, then I do not fear them, and they will not harm me unless my Lord wills something. My Lord encompasses all things in knowledge. Will you not remember and know that He alone is the worshipped and deserving of worship? And how can I fear your idols while you do not fear my Lord who created you and created your idols which you associated with Him in worship without any proof for you for that? So which of the two groups, the group of polytheists and the group of monotheists, is more deserving of tranquility, safety and security from the punishment of God? If you know the truth of what I say, then inform me. Those who believed in God and His Messenger and acted according to His law and did not mix their belief with polytheism - those will have tranquility and safety, and they are the ones who are guided to the path of truth. And that argument with which Abraham argued with his people is Our argument to which We guided him until their argument was cut off. We raise whom We will of Our servants to ranks in this world and the Hereafter. Indeed, your Lord is Wise in His management. He created them and knows them
m-0285	And We bestowed upon Abraham, peace be upon him, that We gave him Isaac as a son and Jacob as a grandson, and We guided each of them to the path of right guidance. And thus We guided to the truth Noah before Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And thus We guided to the truth from the descendants of Noah, David, Solomon, Job, Joseph, Moses and Aaron, peace be upon them. And as We rewarded these prophets for their good deeds, We reward every doer of good. And thus We guided Zachariah, John, Jesus and Elias, and all of these prophets, peace be upon them, were among the righteous. And thus We guided Ishmael, Elisha, Jonah and Lot, and all of these messengers We preferred over the people of their time. And thus We guided to the truth whomever We willed to guide from the fathers of these, their descendants and their brothers, and We chose them for Our religion and to convey Our message to those to whom We sent them, and We guided them to the correct path in which there is no crookedness, which is the monotheism of God Almighty and His exoneration from polytheism. That guidance is the guidance of God by which He guides whomever He wills of His servants. And if these prophets had associated partners with God by way of assumption and estimation, their work would have been in vain. Because Allah the Almighty does not accept any work with polytheism. Those prophets whom We have blessed with guidance and prophethood are those to whom We gave the Book, such as the Scrolls of Abraham, the Torah of Moses, the Psalms of David, and the Gospel of Jesus. We gave them the understanding of these books and chose them to convey Our revelation. If, O Messenger, the disbelievers among your people deny the verses of this Qur’an, We have entrusted them to another people, meaning the Muhajireen and Ansar and their followers until the Day of Resurrection. They are not disbelievers in them, but rather believers in them and do what they indicate. Those mentioned prophets are those whom Allah the Almighty has guided to His true religion. So follow their guidance, O Messenger, and follow their path. Say to the polytheists, “I do not ask of you any compensation in this world for conveying Islam. My reward is only from Allah. Islam is nothing but an invitation to all people to the straight path and a reminder to you and to everyone like you who persists in falsehood, so that you may remember thereby what will benefit you.”
m-0286	And these polytheists did not glorify Allah as He should be glorified, since they denied that Allah the Most High had sent down to any of mankind anything of His revelation. Say to them, O Messenger, if the matter is as you claim, then who sent down the Book that Moses brought to his people as a light for the people and a guidance for them? Then the address was directed to the Jews, rebuking them by saying, “You make this Book into separate pages, showing some of it and concealing much of it.” And among what you concealed was the news of the description of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and his prophethood. And God taught you, O Arabs, the Qur’an that He sent down to you. In it is news of those before you and those after you and what will happen after your death, which you and your fathers did not know. Say, “It is God who sent it down.” Then leave these people in their false talk, babbling and playing. This Qur’an is a book that We have sent down to you, O Messenger, of great benefit, confirming what came before you of the heavenly books. We sent it down to frighten with it the people of Mecca and those around it from the people of all the regions of the earth from the punishment and wrath of Allah. And those who believe in the afterlife believe that the Qur’an is the word of Allah and maintain the establishment of prayer at its appointed times.
m-0287	And who is more unjust than he who fabricates a false statement about Allah, the Most High, and claims that He did not send a messenger from among mankind, or falsely claims that Allah revealed to him and He did not reveal anything to him, or claims that he is able to reveal the like of what Allah revealed of the Qur’an? And if you had seen, O Messenger, these transgressors while they are in the terrors of death, you would have seen a terrible matter, and the angels who seize their souls are stretching out their hands in torment, saying to them, “Bring your souls forth today, you will be humiliated to the utmost degree, just as you used to lie about Allah and be too arrogant to follow His signs and submit to His messengers.” And you have certainly come to Us for reckoning and recompense, alone, just as We created you in this world the first time, barefoot and naked, and you have left behind you what We enabled you to have, of what you boast about of wealth in this world, and we do not see with you in the Hereafter your idols, which you believed would intercede for you and which you claimed were partners with Allah in worship. Your connection that was between you in this world has disappeared, and what you used to claim, that your gods were partners with Allah in worship, has disappeared from you, and it has become apparent. You are the losers of yourselves, your families and your money.
m-0288	Allah the Almighty splits the grain and produces the crop from it, and splits the seed and produces the tree from it. He produces the living from the dead, such as the human being and the animal, for example, from the sperm, and produces the dead from the living, such as the sperm from the human being and the animal. That is Allah, meaning the doer of this. He is Allah alone, with no partner, who is deserving of worship. So how can you turn away from the truth to falsehood and worship other than Him? Allah the Almighty is the One who split the light of the morning from the darkness of the night, and made the night a resting place in which every moving thing rests and is still, and made the sun and the moon run in their orbits with a precise, measured calculation that does not change or disturb. That is the determination of the Almighty, whose power is mighty, the Knower of the interests of His creation and the management of their affairs. The Almighty and the Knower are among the beautiful names of Allah, indicating the perfection of glory and knowledge. Allah the Almighty is the One who made for you, O people, the stars as signs by which you know the paths at night if you are lost due to intense darkness on land and sea. We have explained the clear proofs so that those among you who have knowledge of Allah and His law may ponder them. Allah the Almighty is the One who began your creation, O people, from Adam, peace be upon him, when He created him. From clay, then you were a lineage and a progeny from Him. So He made for you a place of settlement in which you settle, and that is the wombs of women, and a place of storage in which you are preserved, and that is the loins of men. We have explained the arguments and distinguished the evidence and made them perfect for a people who understand the locations of the arguments and the places of the lessons. And God Almighty is the One Who sends down rain from the clouds, and with it brings forth the vegetation of all things. Then He brings forth from the vegetation green crops and trees. Then He brings forth from the crop grains, some of which are compounded by others, like the ears of wheat, barley, and rice. And He brings forth from the date palm shoots, which are what the clusters of dates grow in, clusters that are easy to reach. And He Almighty brought forth orchards of grapes, and He brought forth the olive and pomegranate trees, which are similar in their leaves but differ in their fruit in shape, taste, and nature. Look, O people, at the fruit of this plant when it bears fruit and at its ripening and maturity when it reaches maturity. Indeed, in that, O people, are signs of the perfection of the power of the Creator of these things, His wisdom, and His mercy for a people who believe in Him, the Most High, and act according to His law.
m-0289	These polytheists made the jinn partners with Allah in worship, believing that they can benefit or harm, and Allah created them and what they worship from nothingness. He is the One who is independent in creation alone, so He must be independent in worship alone, with no partner. These polytheists lied about Allah when they attributed sons and daughters to Him, out of ignorance of the attributes of perfection that He deserves. He is far above what the polytheists attributed to Him of that lie and slander. Allah is the One who created the heavens and the earth and what is in them without a previous example. How could He have a son and not have a wife? Allah is far above what the polytheists say. He is the One who created everything from nothingness, and nothing of the affairs of creation is hidden from Him. That, O polytheists, is your Lord, the Exalted and Most High. There is no true deity other than Him, the Creator of all things. So submit and submit to Him in obedience and worship. He, glory be to Him, is the Guardian and Preserver over all things. He manages the affairs of His creation. The eyes do not see Allah in this world, but in the Hereafter, the believers will see their Lord without encompassing Him, and He, glory be to Him, perceives the eyes and encompasses them. And He knows it as it is, and He is the Kind to His friends, the One who knows the subtleties of things, the All-Aware, the One who knows their inner meanings. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, “There have come to you clear proofs by which you may see guidance from misguidance, from what the Qur’an contains and which the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, brought. So whoever understands these proofs and believes in their meanings, that will benefit himself. And whoever does not see guidance after the proof has become clear to him, then that is against himself. And I am not a guardian over you, counting your deeds. I am only a conveyer. And God guides whom He wills and misguides whom He wills according to His knowledge and wisdom.” And just as We have explained in this Qur’an to the polytheists the clear proofs in the matter of monotheism, prophethood, and the afterlife, We explain to them the proofs in everything they are ignorant of, so they say at that time falsely, “I learned it from the People of the Book.” And We will explain, by Our arrangement of the verses, the truth to a people who know it, so they accept it and follow it, and they are the believers in the Messenger of God, Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and what was revealed to him.
m-0290	Follow, O Messenger, what We have revealed to you of the commands and prohibitions, the greatest of which is the oneness of God Almighty and calling to Him. Do not care about the stubbornness of the polytheists and their false claims. If God Almighty had willed that these polytheists would not associate partners, they would not have associated partners. But He is All-Knowing of what will happen from their bad choices and their following of their deviant desires. And We have not made you, O Messenger, a watcher over them to preserve their deeds, nor are you a guardian over them to manage their interests. And do not, O Muslims, curse the idols that the polytheists worship, to block the means so that this does not lead to them cursing God out of ignorance and aggression without knowledge. And just as We have made good to these people their bad deeds as punishment for their bad choices, so good is for every nation its deeds. Then to their Lord is their return, all of them. He will inform them of the deeds that they used to do in this world, then He will reward them for them.
m-0291	And these polytheists swore with firm oaths that if Muhammad came to us with a miraculous sign, we would surely believe in what he brought. Say, O Messenger, the coming of miraculous miracles is only from Allah, the Most High. He is able to bring them when He wills. And what do you know, O believers? Perhaps these miracles, when they come, will not be believed in by these polytheists. And We will turn their hearts and their eyes, preventing them from benefiting from the signs of Allah, so they will not believe in them, just as they did not believe in the signs of the Qur’an when they were first revealed. And We will leave them in their rebellion against Allah, confused, not guided to the truth and right. And if We had answered the request of these people, and sent down to them angels from the heaven, and brought the dead back to life for them so that they could speak to them, and gathered for them everything they asked for, so that they could see it face to face, they would not have believed in what you called them to, O Messenger, and they would not have acted upon it, except for whom Allah willed to be guided. But most of these disbelievers are ignorant of the truth that you have brought from Allah, the Most High.
m-0292	And just as We have tested you, O Messenger, with your enemies from among the polytheists, We have tested all the prophets, peace be upon them, with enemies from among the rebellious ones of their people and enemies from among the rebellious jinn, some of whom throw to others the words which they have beautified with falsehood so that the listener may be deceived thereby and stray from the path of Allah. And if your Lord, glory be to Him, had willed, He could have prevented them from that enmity, but it is a test from Allah, so leave them and what they invent of lies and falsehoods. And so that the hearts of the disbelievers who do not believe in the Hereafter and do not work for it may incline towards it and so that their souls may love it and they may acquire from the evil deeds what they are acquiring. And in this is a great threat to them.
m-0293	Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists: Shall I seek a judge between me and you other than Allah, my God and your God? He is the One Who sent down to you the Qur’an, making clear in it the judgment concerning my affair and your affair, while the Children of Israel, to whom Allah gave the Torah and the Gospel, know with certainty that this Qur’an has been sent down to you, O Messenger, from your Lord in truth. So do not be among those who doubt anything that We have revealed to you. And the word of your Lord, which is the Qur’an, has been fulfilled in truth in its news and statements, and in justice in its rulings. No one can change His perfect words. And Allah, the Most High, is the Hearer of what His servants say, the Forbearing of their outward and inward affairs. And if it were assumed, O Messenger, that you obeyed most of the people of the earth, they would lead you astray from the religion of Allah. They only follow what they think is true by imitating their ancestors, and they only assume and lie. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of those who have gone astray from the path of guidance, and He is most knowing of those who are on the right path and correctness, and none of them is hidden from Him.
m-0294	Eat of the slaughtered animals upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned, if you believe in the clear proofs of Allah. What prevents you, O Muslims, from eating of what the name of Allah has been mentioned upon, while Allah, the Exalted, has made clear to you all that He has forbidden you, but what necessity calls for due to famine, which is forbidden to you, such as dead meat, is permissible for you. And many of those who go astray lead their followers astray from the path of Allah by making permissible what is forbidden and forbidding what is permissible, based on their whims, out of ignorance. Indeed, your Lord, O Messenger, is most knowing of who transgresses His limits in that, and He is the One who will take charge of his reckoning and recompense. And leave, O people, all sins, whether they are public or secret. Indeed, those who commit sins will be punished by their Lord because of the evil deeds they have been doing. And do not eat, O Muslims, of the slaughtered animals upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned upon slaughtering, such as dead meat, or what was slaughtered for idols, jinn, and other than that. Indeed, eating of those slaughtered animals is a departure from the obedience of Allah, the Exalted. And the rebellious jinn cast doubts upon their allies from the devils among mankind about the prohibition of eating dead meat. They order them to say to the Muslims in their argument with them that by not eating dead meat you are not eating what God has killed, while you are eating what you slaughter. And if you obey them, O Muslims, in permitting dead meat, then you and they are equal in polytheism.
m-0295	Or was he who was dead in misguidance, lost and confused, then We revived his heart with faith and guided him to it and made him successful in following His Messengers, so he became living in the lights of guidance like someone like him in ignorance, desires and scattered misguidance, not guided to an outlet or a deliverance from what he is in? They are not equal. And just as You have let down this disbeliever who argues with you, O believers, and You have made his evil deeds seem good to him, so that he sees them as good, You have made their evil deeds seem good to the deniers so that they deserve punishment. And like this that happened from the leaders of the disbelievers in Mecca of turning people away from the religion of Allah the Most High, We have made in every town criminals, led by their elders, so that they may plot therein to turn people away from the religion of Allah. But they plot only against themselves, and they do not perceive that. And when these polytheists from the people of Mecca came with a clear proof of the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, some of their elders said, “We will not believe in his prophethood until Allah gives us prophethood and miracles like what He gave to His previous messengers.” So Allah the Most High responded to them by saying, “Allah knows best where to place His message,” meaning who are worthy of carrying His message. And by conveying it to the people, these tyrants will be humiliated and will suffer a painful punishment in the fire of Hell because of their plot against Islam and its people.
m-0296	Whoever Allah wills to guide to accept the truth, He opens his chest to monotheism and faith. And whoever He wills to misguide, He makes his chest extremely constricted from accepting guidance, like the state of someone who ascends to the upper layers of the atmosphere and is afflicted with severe shortness of breath. And just as Allah makes the chests of the disbelievers extremely constricted and constricted, so He makes the punishment for those who do not believe in Him. And what we have explained to you, O Messenger, is the path leading to the pleasure of your Lord and His Paradise. We have explained the proofs for those who remember from the people of sound minds. For those who remember, with their Lord, the Most High, on the Day of Resurrection, there is a house of safety and security from every harm, which is Paradise. And He, the Most High, is their supporter and protector, as a reward for them because of their righteous deeds.
m-0297	And remember, O Messenger, the Day when Allah will gather the disbelievers and their allies from the devils of the jinn, and He will say, “O company of jinn, you have misled many of mankind.” And their allies from the disbelieving humans will say, “Our Lord, some of us have benefited from others, and we have reached the term which You have appointed for us, with the end of our worldly life.” Allah will say to them, “The Fire is your abode, that is, the place where you will reside, abiding therein forever, except for those whom Allah wills not to abide therein from among the disobedient monotheists. Indeed, your Lord is Wise in His management and creation, Knowing of all the affairs of His servants.” And just as We empowered the devils of the jinn over the disbelieving humans, so they were their allies, We will empower the wrongdoers from among mankind, some over others, in this world because of the sins they do. O polytheists from among the jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messengers from among your group? The apparent meaning of the texts indicates that the messengers from among mankind only inform you of My clear signs that include commands and prohibitions and clarification of good and evil, and warn you of meeting My punishment on the Day of Resurrection. These polytheists from among mankind and jinn will say, “We bear witness against ourselves that Your messengers have conveyed to us Your signs and warned us.” We only excused the two heavy beings by sending the messengers and revealing the books so that no one would be held accountable for his wrongdoing while his message had not reached him. But We excused the nations and We did not punish anyone except after sending the messengers to them.
m-0298	And for every worker in obedience to Allah the Most High or in disobedience to Him, there are ranks of his work that Allah will grant him and reward him for it. And your Lord, O Messenger, is not unaware of what His servants do. And your Lord, O Messenger, who commanded people to worship Him, is the Self-sufficient, and all His creation is in need of Him. And He, glory be to Him, is the Possessor of vast mercy. If He had willed, He would have destroyed you and created a people other than you to succeed you after your demise and to work in obedience to Him, the Most High, just as He created you from the offspring of other people who were before you. Indeed, what your Lord promises you, O polytheists, of punishment for your disbelief will befall you, and you will not be unable to escape from your Lord, for He is able to restore you even if you become dust and bones. Say, O Messenger, O people, work according to your way, for I am working according to my way that my Lord, glory be to Him, has prescribed for me. Then you will know when the punishment befalls you who will have a good outcome. Indeed, he who transgresses his limits and is unjust and associates others with Allah will not attain the pleasure of Allah the Most High and Paradise.
m-0299	The polytheists assigned to Allah, the Almighty, a portion of what He created of crops, fruits and livestock, which He offers to guests and the poor. They assigned another portion of these things to their partners of idols and stone pillars. Whatever was designated for their partners reaches them alone and does not reach Allah, and whatever was designated for Allah, the Almighty, reaches their partners. Evil is the judgment and division of the people. Just as Satan made attractive to the polytheists that they should assign to Allah, the Almighty, a portion of the crops and livestock and to their partners a portion, the devils made attractive to many of the polytheists the killing of their children for fear of poverty, in order to cause these fathers to perish by killing a soul that Allah has forbidden to be killed except by right, and to confuse their religion for them so that it becomes confused and they go astray and perish. If Allah had willed that they not do that, they would not have done it, but He decreed that because of His knowledge of their bad condition and their end. So leave them, O Messenger, to their own devices in what they fabricate of lies, and Allah will judge between you and them.
m-0300	The polytheists said, “These are forbidden camels and crops, and no one may eat them except those whom they permit, according to their claim, from the guardians of idols and others. These are camels whose backs are forbidden, so it is not permissible to ride them or carry loads on them under any circumstances. These are camels on which they do not mention the name of Allah the Most High in any matter of their affairs. They did that as a lie against Allah. Allah will punish them for what they used to fabricate of lies against Him, glory be to Him. The polytheists said, “What is in the bellies of livestock of fetuses is permissible for our men and forbidden for our women if it is born alive, and they share in it if it is born dead.” Allah will punish them because they have legislated for themselves what is permissible and forbidden that Allah did not permit. He is the All-Wise in managing the affairs of His creation, Knowing of them. Those who killed their children because of the weakness of their minds and their ignorance, and forbade what Allah provided for them, lying about Allah, have lost and perished. They have strayed from the truth and were not among the people of guidance and right conduct. So, what is permissible and forbidden are characteristics of divinity in legislation. What is permissible is what Allah has permitted, and what is forbidden is what Allah has forbidden, and no one among His creation has the same right. It was or a group that legislates for his servants what God did not permit
m-0301	Allah, the Almighty, is the One Who created for you gardens, some of which are raised above the ground, such as grapes, and some of which are not raised but stand on their stems, such as palm trees and crops of various tastes, and olives and pomegranates, similar in appearance but different in fruit and taste. Eat, O people, from its fruit when it bears fruit and give its obligatory zakat on the day of its harvest and picking, and do not exceed the limits of moderation in spending money and eating food and other things. Indeed, the Almighty does not love those who exceed His limits by spending money in ways other than its intended purpose. And He created from the livestock some that are prepared for carrying loads due to their size and height, such as camels, and some that are prepared for other than carrying loads due to their smallness and proximity to the ground, such as cows and sheep. Eat from what Allah has permitted you and given you from these livestock, and do not forbid what Allah has permitted of them, following the ways of Satan, as the polytheists did. Indeed, Satan is to you an enemy, manifest in enmity.
m-0302	These are the livestock that Allah has provided for His servants from camels, cows and sheep, eight types, four of which are sheep, which are male and female sheep, and male and female goats. Say, O Messenger, to those polytheists, “Did Allah forbid the two male sheep?” If they say, “Yes,” then they have lied in that, because they do not forbid every male sheep and goat. Say to them, “Did Allah forbid the two female sheep?” If they say, “Yes,” then they have also lied, because they do not forbid every female offspring of sheep and goats. Say to them, “Did Allah forbid what the wombs of the two females contain of sheep and goats of pregnancy?” If they say, “Yes,” then they have also lied, because they do not forbid every pregnancy of that. Tell me with knowledge that indicates the truth of what you have gone to, if you are truthful in what you attribute to your Lord. The other four types are two male and female camels, and two male and female cows. Say, O Messenger, to those polytheists, “Did Allah forbid the two males or the two females, or did He forbid what the wombs of the two females contain, male and female, or were you…” O polytheists, be present when God commands you to prohibit livestock. No one is more unjust than he who fabricates lies about God in order to divert people from the path of guidance through his ignorance. God Almighty does not guide to the right path anyone who exceeds his limits and lies about his Lord and leads people astray.
m-0303	Say, O Messenger, I do not find in what Allah has revealed to me anything forbidden to those who eat it from what you mention as forbidden from the livestock, unless it died without being slaughtered properly, or it is spilled blood, or it is the flesh of swine, for it is impure, or its slaughter was in disobedience to Allah, the Most High, such as if the name of someone other than Allah was mentioned over the slaughtered animal at the time of slaughter. So whoever is forced to eat from these forbidden things due to severe hunger, not seeking to eat them out of pleasure or exceeding the limit of necessity, then Allah, the Most High, is Forgiving and Merciful to him. It has been proven later in the Sunnah that every fanged beast of prey and every clawed bird, domestic donkey and dog are forbidden. And mention, O Messenger, to these polytheists what We have forbidden to the Jews from the beasts and birds, which is everything that does not have split toes, such as camels and ostriches, and the fat of cows and sheep, except for what is attached to their backs or intestines, or mixed with the bone of the buttocks and side, and the like. This mentioned prohibition on the Jews is a punishment from Us to them because of their evil deeds, and We are truthful in what We have informed about them. If you lie, O Messenger, those who oppose you from among the polytheists, Jews, and others, say to them: Your Lord, glory be to Him, is the possessor of vast mercy, and He will not avert His punishment from the people who committed crimes, acquired sins, and perpetrated evil deeds. In this is a threat to them for opposing the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace.
m-0304	"Those who associate others with Allah will say, ""If Allah had willed that we and our fathers should not associate others with Allah and that we should not forbid anything besides Him, we would not have done so."" Allah responded to them by stating that this doubt was raised by the disbelievers before them, and they denied the call of their messengers with it, and they continued to do so until Allah's punishment descended upon them. Say to them, O Messenger, ""Do you have correct knowledge about what you have forbidden of livestock and crops, and about what you claim that Allah has willed for you disbelief and has accepted it from you and loved it for you, so that you can show it to us? You follow nothing in the matters of this religion except mere conjecture, and you are nothing but liars."" Say, O Messenger, to them, ""Allah, the Most High, has the decisive proof by which He wills to cut off your conjectures. If He willed, He could have guided you all to the path of righteousness."" Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, ""Bring your witnesses who testify that Allah, the Most High, is the One who forbade what you have forbidden of crops and livestock. If they testify falsely and falsely, do not believe them, and do not agree with those who rule according to their desires, so they denied the signs of Allah in what they went to of forbidding what Allah has permitted and permitting what Allah has forbidden."" And do not follow those who do not believe in the Hereafter and do not work for it, and those who associate others with their Lord, worshipping others along with Him."
m-0305	Say, O Messenger, to them: Come, I will recite what your Lord has forbidden you: Do not associate anything with Him from His creation in worship, but devote all types of worship to Him alone, such as fear, hope, supplication, and other things. Be good to your parents by being kind, supplicating, and doing good deeds. Do not kill your children because of poverty that has befallen you, for God will provide for you and them. Do not approach what is apparent of the great sins and what is hidden. Do not kill the soul that God has forbidden to be killed except by right, and that is in the case of retaliation for a murderer or adultery after marriage or apostasy from Islam. That which has been mentioned is what God has forbidden you from and has enjoined upon you to avoid, and what He has commanded you to do, your Lord has enjoined upon you so that you may understand His commands and prohibitions. And do not approach, O guardians, the property of an orphan except in a way that will make his property sound and useful until he reaches the age of puberty and becomes an adult. When he reaches that age, then hand over his property to him and give full measure and weight with justice, which will be the fullest fulfillment. And if you exert your best effort, then there is no blame upon you for what may be from We do not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. And when you speak, then seek justice in your speech without deviating from the truth in news, testimony, judgment, or intercession. Even if the one to whom the statement is related is a relative of yours, do not deviate from him unjustly. And fulfill what Allah has enjoined upon you of adhering to His law. That is what is recited to you of the rulings. Your Lord has enjoined upon you in the hope that you will remember the consequences of your affair. And among what Allah has enjoined upon you is that this Islam is the straight path of Allah, so follow it and do not follow the paths of misguidance, for they will separate you and distance you from the straight path of Allah. That is the orientation toward the straight path that Allah has enjoined upon you so that you may fear His punishment by doing what He has commanded and avoiding what He has forbidden.
m-0306	Then say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, that it is Allah who gave Moses the Torah to complete His favor upon the doers of good among the people of his religion and to detail everything of their religion and to guide and point to the straight path and to be a mercy to them in the hope that they will believe in the resurrection after death and the reckoning and reward and work for that. And this Qur’an is a book that We sent down to our Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, its good is abundant, so follow it in what it commands and forbids and fear Allah lest you disobey his command in the hope that you will be shown mercy and be saved from His punishment and attain His reward. And We sent down this Qur’an so that you will not say, O disbelieving Arabs, that the Book was only sent down from the heaven to the Jews and Christians, and we were busy reading their books and we had no knowledge or understanding of them. And so that you will not say, O polytheists, that if a book had been sent down to us from the heaven as it was sent down to the Jews and Christians, we would have been more upright on the path of truth than they. But there has come to you a book in your language, clear Arabic. And that is a clear proof from your Lord and guidance to the path of truth and a mercy to this nation, for no one is more unjust. And aggression from those who denied the proofs of Allah the Most High and turned away from them, then these who turn away We will punish them severely in the fire of Hell because of their turning away from Our signs and their obstruction from Our path. Do those who turned away and obstructed from the path of Allah expect anything but for the Angel of Death and his helpers to come to them to take their souls or for your Lord, O Messenger, to come to judge between His servants on the Day of Resurrection or for some of the signs of the Hour and its indications of its coming to come, which is the rising of the sun from its place of setting? When that happens, no soul will benefit from its faith if it did not believe before, and no good deed will be accepted from it if it was a believer if it did not practice it before that. Say to them, O Messenger, wait for that to come so that you may know the truth from the false and the evildoer from the good. Indeed, We are awaiting that.
m-0307	Those who divided their religion after they had been united in the Oneness of Allah and in acting according to His law, and became sects and parties, you, O Messenger, are innocent of them. Their judgment is with Allah, the Most High. Then He will inform them of their deeds, and He will reward whoever among them repents and does good with his goodness, and He will punish the wrongdoer with his wrongdoing. Whoever meets his Lord on the Day of Resurrection with a good deed will have ten good deeds like it, and whoever meets his Lord with an evil deed will not be punished except with the like thereof, and they will not be wronged by as much as an atom’s weight.
m-0308	Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, that my Lord has guided me to the straight path that leads to His Paradise, which is the religion of Islam, which is responsible for the affairs of this world and the Hereafter. It is the religion of monotheism, the religion of Abraham, peace be upon him. Abraham, peace be upon him, was not among those who associated others with God except Him. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, that my prayer and my sacrifice, that is, my offerings, are for God alone, not for idols, nor for the dead, nor for the jinn, nor for anything else that you sacrifice to other than God and in other than His name, as you do. My life and my death are for God Almighty, Lord of the worlds. He has no partner in His divinity, nor in His lordship, nor in His attributes and names. With this pure monotheism, my Lord, glory be to Him, commanded me, and I am the first of this nation to acknowledge and submit to God.
m-0309	Say, O Messenger, should I seek a god other than Allah while He is the Creator of all things, their Owner and Disposer? And no human being does a bad deed except that its sin is upon him, and no sinful soul shall bear the sin of another soul. Then to your Lord is your return on the Day of Resurrection, and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ concerning the matter of religion. And Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who made you succeed those who preceded you upon the earth after Allah had destroyed them, and made you successors upon it so that you might populate it after them in obedience to your Lord. And He raised some of you in provision and strength above others in degrees, that He might test you with what He has given you of His blessings, and that He might make apparent to the people who are grateful and who are not. Indeed, your Lord is swift in punishment for those who disbelieve in Him and disobey Him. And indeed, He is Forgiving to those who believe in Him and do righteous deeds and repent from destructive sins. Merciful to them. And the Forgiving and the Merciful are two of the Most Beautiful Names of Allah.
m-0310	"The disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah.

This Qur’an is a great book that God has sent down to you, O Messenger. So let there be no doubt in your heart that it was sent down from God, and do not be hesitant in conveying it and warning with it. We have sent it down to you so that you may frighten the disbelievers and remind the believers.

O people, follow what has been sent down to you from your Lord of the Book and the Sunnah by obeying the commands and avoiding the prohibitions. And do not follow other guardians besides God, such as the devils, the rabbis, and the monks. Indeed, you rarely learn admonition and take heed and return to the truth."
m-0311	And many a town We destroyed because of their disobedience to Our messengers and their denial of them, and this was followed by the disgrace of this world, connected to the humiliation of the Hereafter. So Our punishment came to them once while they were asleep at night and once while they were asleep during the day. And Allah singled out these two times because they are times of rest and relaxation, so the coming of the punishment in them is more terrible and severe. So their only statement when the punishment came was an admission of sins and wrongdoing, and that they were deserving of the punishment that had descended upon them. So We will surely ask the nations to whom the messengers were sent, what was your response to Our messengers to you? And We will surely ask the messengers about their delivery of the messages of their Lord and about what their nations responded to them. So We will relate to all of creation what they did, with knowledge from Us, regarding their actions in this world in what We commanded them to do and what We forbade them from doing. And We were never absent from them in any case.
m-0312	And the weighing of people's deeds on the Day of Resurrection will be with a true scale of justice and equity in which there is no injustice. So whoever's scales of deeds are heavy due to the abundance of his good deeds, they are the successful ones. And whoever's scales of deeds are light due to the abundance of his bad deeds, they are the ones who lost their share of the pleasure of Allah Almighty because they transgressed the limit by denying the signs of Allah Almighty and not submitting to them. And We have established you, O people, upon the earth and made it a resting place for you and provided for you therein that by which you live of food and drink. And yet your gratitude for the blessings of Allah is little.
m-0313	"And We have bestowed upon you the favor of creating your origin, your father Adam, from nothingness, then We formed him in his preferred form over many of creation, then We commanded Our angels, peace be upon them, to prostrate to him out of honor and respect and to show the superiority of Adam, so they all prostrated, but Iblis, who was with them, was not among those who prostrated to Adam out of envy of him for this great honor.

Allah the Almighty said, denouncing Iblis for not prostrating, “What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?” Iblis said, “I am better than him in creation because I was created from fire, and he was created from clay.” So he saw that fire was more honorable than clay.

Allah the Almighty said to Iblis, “Then descend from Paradise, for it is not right for you to be arrogant therein. Get out of Paradise, for you are among the humiliated and contemptible.”

Iblis said to Allah the Almighty when he despaired of His mercy, “Give me respite until the Day of Resurrection,” so that I may be able to mislead whomever I can from the children of Adam.

Allah the Almighty said, “You are among those upon whom the delay of the appointed time has been decreed until the first blast of the century when all creation will die.”

Iblis said, “May Allah curse him, so because of what you have led me astray, I will strive to mislead the children of Adam.” From your straight path and I will turn them away from the Islam that you created them upon. Then I will come to them from all sides and sides and turn them away from the truth and make falsehood seem good to them and make them desire this world and make them doubt the Hereafter. You will not find most of the children of Adam grateful to you for your blessings. God Almighty said to Satan, “Get out of Paradise, hated and banished. I will fill Hell with you and those who follow you from the children of Adam, all together.”"
m-0314	And O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise, and eat of its fruits wherever you wish, but do not eat of the fruit of a tree that has been specified for them. For if you were to do that, you would be among the wrongdoers who transgress the limits of Allah. Then Satan whispered to Adam and Eve a whisper to make them fall into disobeying Allah by eating from that tree that Allah had forbidden them from, so that their consequences would be the exposure of what had been concealed of their private parts. He said to them in an attempt to deceive them, “Your Lord has only forbidden you from eating from the fruit of this tree so that you would not be angels and so that you would not be among those who live forever.” And Satan swore to Adam and Eve by Allah that he was among those who advised them in his advice to eat from the tree, and he was lying in that. So he emboldened them and deceived them, so they ate from the tree that Allah had forbidden them from approaching. When they ate from it, their private parts were exposed to them and what Allah had concealed for them before the disobedience was removed. They began to stick some of the leaves of Paradise over their private parts, and their Lord, the Most High, called out to them, “Did I not forbid you from eating from that tree and tell you that Satan is indeed a liar?” You have an enemy who is clearly hostile. This verse is evidence that exposing the private parts is one of the gravest of matters and that it was and still is considered reprehensible in nature and ugly in minds. Adam and Eve said, “Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves by eating from the tree. If You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among those who have lost their share in this world and the Hereafter.” These are the words that Adam received from his Lord, so he prayed with them and Allah accepted his repentance. Allah the Almighty said, addressing Adam and Eve to Satan, “Descend from the sky to the earth, and you will be enemies to one another. And for you on the earth is a place where you will settle and enjoy until your appointed times come to an end.” Allah the Almighty said to Adam and Eve and their descendants, “Therein you will live,” meaning on the earth you will spend the days of your worldly life and in it will be your death, and from it your Lord will bring you forth and gather you alive on the Day of Resurrection.
m-0315	O children of Adam, We have made for you clothing that covers your private parts, and it is the clothing of necessity, and clothing for adornment and beautification, and it is from perfection and luxury, and the clothing of fearing Allah the Most High by doing what is commanded and avoiding what is forbidden, is the best clothing for the believer. That which Allah has bestowed upon you is evidence of the Lordship of Allah the Most High, His Oneness, His grace and His mercy towards His servants, so that you may remember these blessings and thank Allah for them. In that is gratitude from Allah the Most High for creating these blessings. O children of Adam, do not let Satan deceive you and make sin seem attractive to you, just as he made it attractive to your parents Adam and Eve, and because of it he expelled them from Paradise, and he stripped them of the clothing with which Allah covered them, so that their private parts would be exposed to them. Indeed, Satan sees you, he and his offspring and his kind, while you do not see them, so beware of them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to the disbelievers who do not believe in the Oneness of Allah, nor believe in His messengers, nor act according to His guidance.
m-0316	And if the disbelievers commit an ugly act, they apologize for doing it by saying that it is something they inherited from their fathers and that it is something that Allah has commanded. Say to them, O Messenger, that Allah does not command His servants to do ugly and evil deeds. Do you, O polytheists, say about Allah what you do not know, a lie and slander? Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, that my Lord has commanded justice and has commanded you to devote worship to Him in every place, especially in the mosques, and to call upon Him, sincerely obeying and worshipping Him, and to believe in the resurrection after death. Just as Allah created you from nothingness, He is able to restore life to you again. Allah has divided His servants into two groups: a group that He guided to the straight path, and a group that it is obligatory for them to stray from the straight path. They took the devils as allies instead of Allah, so they obeyed them out of ignorance and thinking that they had taken the path of guidance.
m-0317	O children of Adam, when performing every prayer, be in a state of permissible adornment, such as clothing that covers your private parts, cleanliness, purity, and the like, and eat and drink from the good things that Allah has provided for you, and do not exceed the limits of moderation in that. Indeed, Allah does not love those who transgress and are extravagant in food, drink, and other things. Say, O Messenger, to these ignorant polytheists, who has forbidden you to wear the good clothes that Allah has made an adornment for you, and who has forbidden you to enjoy the lawful and good things that Allah has provided? Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, that what Allah has permitted of clothing and good things of food and drink is the right of those who believe in the life of this world, and others will share in it with them, and will be exclusively for them on the Day of Resurrection. Like that detail Allah explains the verses for a people who know what He makes clear to them and understand what distinguishes them. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, that Allah has only forbidden the ugly things of deeds, whether apparent or hidden, and He has forbidden all sins, the greatest of which is transgressing against people, for that is contrary to the truth, and it is forbidden for you to worship with Allah other than Him, which you have not He sends down evidence and proof for it, for there is no argument for the one who does that. It is forbidden for you to attribute to God Almighty what He did not legislate, as a fabrication and a lie, such as claiming that God has a son and forbidding some permissible clothing and food. For every group that gathered to disbelieve in God Almighty and deny His Messengers, peace and blessings be upon them, there is a time for the punishment to befall them. When the time that God has set for their destruction comes, they will not delay it for a moment, nor will they advance it.
m-0318	"O children of Adam, when there come to you My messengers from among your people, reciting to you the verses of My Book and making clear to you the proofs of the truth of what they have brought you, then obey them. Indeed, whoever fears My wrath and corrects his deeds - there will be no fear concerning them on the Day of Resurrection from the punishment of Allah, the Most High, nor will they grieve over what they have missed of the worldly fortunes. And the disbelievers who denied the proofs of the Oneness of Allah and were too arrogant to follow them - those are the companions of the Fire, abiding therein, never emerging from it. No one is more unjust than he who fabricates a lie against Allah, the Most High, or denies His revealed verses. Those will receive their share of the punishment from what was written for them in the Preserved Tablet until, when the Angel of Death and his helpers come to them, taking their souls, they will say to them, ""Where are those whom you used to worship besides Allah - of partners and allies and idols - in order to save you from what you are in?"" They will say, ""They have departed from us."" And they will then admit against themselves that they were in this world denying and rejecting the Oneness of Allah, the Most High."
m-0319	Allah the Almighty said to these polytheists who fabricate, “Enter the Fire along with groups like you in disbelief who have preceded you from among the jinn and mankind.” Whenever a group of people from a religion enters the Fire, it curses its counterpart that went astray by following it, until the first of the people of the disbelieving religions and the last of them all follow one another in the Fire. The last of them who were followed in this world will say to their leaders, “Our Lord, these are the ones who led us astray from the truth, so give them a double punishment in the Fire.” Allah the Almighty said, “For each is double,” meaning for each of you and them is a double punishment in the Fire. But you do not realize, O followers, what each group among you has of punishment and pain. The leaders and others who were followed said to their followers, “We and you are equal in error and misguidance and in doing the causes of punishment, so you have no superiority over us.” Allah the Almighty said to them all, “So taste the punishment,” meaning the punishment of Hell, because of what you have earned of sins. Indeed, the disbelievers who did not believe in Our proofs and signs that prove Our Oneness and did not act according to Our law out of arrogance and haughtiness, no doors will be opened for their deeds in this life or for their souls at death. Heaven and these infidels cannot enter Paradise unless a camel enters the eye of a needle and this is impossible. And such is the punishment We give to those whose crimes are many and whose transgression is severe. These infidels will abide eternally in Hell. They will have beds of Hell beneath them and blankets above them that cover them. And with such severe punishment God Almighty punishes the wrongdoers who transgressed His limits and disbelieved in Him and disobeyed Him.
m-0320	And those who believe in Allah and do righteous deeds within the limits of their ability - Allah does not charge a soul with more than it can bear. Those are the people of Paradise; they will abide therein forever, never leaving it. Allah will remove any rancor and grudges from the hearts of the people of Paradise. And among the perfection of their bliss is that rivers flow in Paradise beneath them. And the people of Paradise will say when they enter it, “Praise be to Allah who has guided us to righteous deeds that have earned us what we are in of bliss.” And we would not have been guided to follow the straight path had Allah not guided us to follow this path and guided us to remain steadfast on it. The messengers of our Lord have come with the truth of informing us of the promise of those who obey Him and the threat of those who disobey Him. And they will be called out to congratulate them and honor them, “This is Paradise, which Allah has given you as an inheritance through His mercy and for what you have presented of faith and righteous deeds.”
m-0321	And the people of Paradise will call out to the people of Hell after they have entered it, saying to them, “Indeed, we have found what our Lord promised us through His messengers to be true, regarding the reward of those who obey Him. Have you found what your Lord promised you through His messengers to be true, regarding the punishment of those who disobey Him?” The people of Hell will answer them, saying, “Yes, we have found what our Lord promised us to be true.” Then a crier will announce between the people of Paradise and the people of Hell, “The curse of God be upon the wrongdoers who transgressed the limits of God and disbelieved in God and His messengers.” These disbelievers are those who turned away from the straight path of God and prevented people from following it and sought for the path to be crooked so that no one could see it, and they are ungrateful for the Hereafter and what is in it.
m-0322	"And between the people of Paradise and the people of Hell there is a great barrier called Al-A'raf, and on this barrier are men who recognize the people of Paradise and the people of Hell by their signs, such as the whiteness of the faces of the people of Paradise and the blackness of the faces of the people of Hell. These men are people whose good deeds and bad deeds are equal, and they hope for the mercy of Allah Almighty. The men of Al-A'raf will call out to the people of Paradise with greetings, saying to them, ""Peace be upon you."" The people of Al-A'raf have not yet entered Paradise, and they hope to enter it. And when the eyes of the men of Al-A'raf are turned toward the people of Hell, they will say, ""Our Lord, do not place us with the wrongdoing people because of their polytheism and disbelief."" And the people of Al-A'raf will call out to men from the leaders of the disbelievers who are in Hell, whom they recognize by special signs that distinguish them, and they will say to them, ""What benefit did you gain from the wealth and men you used to accumulate in this world, and what benefit did your arrogance in refusing to believe in Allah and accept the truth?"" Are these the weak and the poor from the people of Paradise, about whom you swore in this world that Allah would not include them in mercy on the Day of Resurrection and would not admit them to Paradise? Enter Paradise, O people of Al-A'raf, for you have been forgiven. You have no fear of Allah's punishment, and you will not grieve over what you have missed of the worldly fortunes."
m-0323	The people of Hell will seek help from the people of Paradise, asking them to pour water or food on them, so they will answer that God Almighty has forbidden food and drink to those who denied His Oneness and denied His Messengers. Those whom God Almighty has deprived of the bliss of the Hereafter are those who made the religion that God commanded them to follow false and distracted, and were deceived by the worldly life and were distracted by its adornments from working for the Hereafter. On the Day of Resurrection, God Almighty will forget them and leave them in painful torment, just as they abandoned working to meet this Day of theirs, and because they deny God’s proofs and evidence, even though they know that it is true.
m-0324	And We have certainly brought to the disbelievers a Qur’an which We have revealed to you, O Messenger. We have made it clear, containing great knowledge, guiding from misguidance to right guidance and a mercy for a people who believe in Allah and act according to His law. He has singled them out above others because they are the ones who will benefit from it. Do the disbelievers expect anything but what they were promised in the Qur’an of punishment that will lead to their affair on the Day when what will lead to their affair of reckoning, reward and punishment comes on the Day of Resurrection? The disbelievers who abandoned the Qur’an and disbelieved in it in worldly life will say, “It has now become clear to us that the messengers of our Lord have come with the truth and advised us. Do we have friends and intercessors to intercede for us with our Lord, or are we returned to the world once again so that we may act in it in a way that pleases Allah?” They have lost themselves by entering the Fire and abiding therein forever, and what they used to worship besides Allah and invent in this world, which Satan promised them, has gone away from them.
m-0325	Your Lord, O people, is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth from nothingness in six days, then He, glory be to Him, rose above the Throne, that is, He ascended and rose in a manner befitting His Majesty and Greatness. Glory be to Him, He causes the night to enter upon the day, so He covers it with it until its light is gone, and He causes the day to enter upon the night, so its darkness is gone, and each one of them seeks the other quickly and always. And He, glory be to Him, is the One who created the sun, the moon, and the stars, subservient to Him. He, glory be to Him, makes them subservient to Him as He wills. They are among the great signs of Allah. Is not His, glory be to Him, the Most High, the All-Knowing, all creation belongs to Him, and His is the entire command? Allah, glory be to Him, is exalted and glorified, and is far removed from all deficiency, Lord of all creation. O believers, call upon your Lord, humbly submitting to Him in secret and privately, and let the call be with humility and far from hypocrisy, for Allah, glory be to Him, does not love those who transgress the limits of His law, and the greatest transgression is associating partners with Allah, such as calling upon other than Allah, such as the dead and idols and the like. And do not corrupt the earth with any kind of corruption after Allah has reformed it by sending the Messengers, peace be upon them, and populating it with obedience to Allah. Call upon Him, glory be to Him, sincerely. Pray for him out of fear of his punishment and hope for his reward, for the mercy of God is close to the doers of good.
m-0326	And Allah the Almighty is the One Who sends the gentle, good winds, bringing good tidings of the rain that they stir up by Allah’s permission, so that the creation rejoices in Allah’s mercy. Then, when the wind carries the clouds laden with rain, Allah drives them with it to revive a land whose land has become barren and whose trees and crops have dried up. Then Allah sends down rain, and with it brings forth grass, trees, and crops, and its trees return laden with various types of fruits. Just as We revive this dead land with rain, We bring forth the dead from their graves alive after their demise so that you may learn a lesson and find evidence of Allah’s Oneness and His ability to resurrect. And the pure land, when rain falls upon it, produces vegetation by Allah’s permission and will, good and easy. And so is the believer, when Allah’s verses descend upon him, he benefits from them and they produce a good life in him. As for the salty, bad land, it produces only bad, difficult vegetation that is of no benefit, and it does not produce good vegetation. And so is the disbeliever who does not benefit from Allah’s verses. Like this wonderful variety in the statement, We diversify the arguments and proofs to prove the truth for people who thank Allah for His blessings and obey Him.
m-0327	We sent Noah to his people to call them to the Oneness of God, the Most High, and to sincerely worship Him. He said, “O my people, worship God alone. You have no god worthy of worship other than Him, the Most High, the Most Great. So sincerely worship Him. But if you do not do so and continue to worship your idols, then I fear that the punishment of a Day will befall you on which your trial will be great, which is the Day of Resurrection.” Their leaders and dignitaries said to him, “We believe, O Noah, that you are clearly astray from the right path.” Noah said, “O my people, I am not astray in any matter in any way, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds, my Lord and your Lord and the Lord of all creation. I convey to you what I have been sent with from my Lord, and I advise you, warning you of the punishment of God and giving good tidings of His reward, and I know of His law what you do not know.” Did it arouse your astonishment that God Almighty sent down to you what reminds you of what is good for you on the tongue of a man from among you whose lineage and truthfulness you know, so that you may fear the wrath and punishment of God Almighty and so that you may fear His wrath by believing in Him and hoping to attain His mercy? And His reward is abundant. So they denied Noah, so We saved him and those who believed with him in the ship, and We drowned the disbelievers who denied Our clear proofs. Indeed, they were blind of heart from seeing the truth.
m-0328	"And We sent to the tribe of Aad their brother Hud when they worshipped idols besides Allah. He said to them, “Worship Allah alone. You have no deity worthy of worship other than Him, the Most High, the Most Great.” So worship Him sincerely. Will you not fear the punishment of Allah and His wrath upon you?

The great ones who disbelieved among the people of Hud said, “Indeed, we know that in calling us to abandon the worship of our gods and worship Allah alone, you are deficient in reason, and we believe that you are among the liars against Allah in what you say.”

Hud said, “O my people, there is no deficiency in my reason, but I am a messenger to you from the Lord of all creation. I convey to you what my Lord has sent me with, and I am for you, in what I have called you to of the oneness of Allah and working according to His law, a sincere advisor upon the revelation of Allah Almighty.”

And did it arouse your astonishment that Allah Almighty revealed to you what reminds you of what is good for you through the tongue of a man from among you whose lineage and truthfulness you know, in order to frighten you with the wrath and punishment of Allah? And remember the favor of Allah upon you when He made you succeed those before you on the earth after He destroyed the people of Noah and increased in your bodies strength and size, so remember the many favors of Allah upon you. May you win the great victory in this world and the hereafter

Aad said to Hud, peace be upon him, you called us to worship God alone and abandon the worship of idols that we inherited from our fathers, so bring us the punishment that you threaten us with if you are from the people of truth in what you say

Hud said to his people, a punishment and wrath from your Lord, glory be to Him, has come upon you. Do you argue with me about these idols that you and your fathers have called gods? God has not sent down any proof or evidence for them because they are created and do not harm or benefit. Rather, the only one to be worshipped is the Creator, glory be to Him. So wait for the punishment to descend upon you, for I am waiting with you for it to descend. This is the ultimate threat and warning

So God’s punishment came upon them by sending a strong wind, so God saved Hud and those who believed with him with a great mercy from Him, the Most High, and destroyed all the disbelievers from his people and destroyed them to the last of them, and they were not believers because they combined between denying the signs of God and abandoning righteous deeds"
m-0329	"And We sent to the tribe of Thamud their brother Salih when they worshipped idols other than Allah, the Most High. Salih said to them, ""O my people, worship Allah alone. You have no god worthy of worship other than Him, the Most High, the Most Great. So devote your worship to Him. I have come to you with proof of the truth of what I call you to, when I called upon Allah before you, and He brought forth for you from the rock a great she-camel as you asked. So leave her to graze in the pastures of Allah's land, and do not expose her to any harm, lest a painful punishment befall you because of that. And remember the favor of Allah upon you when He made you succeed those before you in the land after the tribe of 'Aad, and established you in the good land, where you settled, building great houses in its plains and carving out other houses from its mountains. So remember the favors of Allah upon you and do not strive to cause corruption in the land."" The nobles and leaders of those who were arrogant among the people of Salih said to the believers who weakened them and belittled them, ""Do you know the truth that Salih has been sent to us by Allah?"" Those who believed said, ""Indeed, we are believers in what Allah has sent him with, following His law."" Those who were arrogant said, ""Indeed, we are by that which Allah has sent us."" You believed in him and followed him from the prophethood of Salih, denying.

So they slaughtered the she-camel in contempt of Salih’s threat and were too arrogant to obey their Lord’s command and said, in mockery and to distance the punishment, “O Salih, bring us what you threaten us with of punishment, if you are one of the messengers of Allah.”

So the severe earthquake seized those who disbelieved, which tore their hearts apart, so they became in their land, destroyed, clinging to the ground on their knees and faces, not one of them escaped.

So Salih, peace be upon him, turned away from his people when they hamstrung the she-camel and destruction befell them, and said to them, “O my people, I have conveyed to you what my Lord has commanded me to convey of His commands and prohibitions, and I have exerted my effort to encourage, intimidate, and advise you, but you do not like advisors, so you rejected their words and obeyed every outcast devil.”"
m-0330	"And remember, O Messenger, Lot, peace be upon him, when he said to his people, “Do you do the abhorrent act that has reached the peak of ugliness, which no one before you has done among the creatures?”

You approach males from behind out of desire from you, not caring about its ugliness, leaving what God has made lawful for you from your women. Rather, you are a people who transgress the limits of God in extravagance. Indeed, approaching males without females is one of the indecencies that the people of Lot invented and no one from creation preceded them in it.

And the response of the people of Lot when he denounced their heinous act was that some of them said to each other, “Expel Lot and his family from your country, for he and those who followed him are people who abstain from approaching the behinds of men and women.”

So God saved Lot and his family from the punishment when He ordered him to leave that country, except for his wife, for she was among the perished who remain in the punishment of God.

And God punished the disbelievers from the people of Lot by sending down upon them a rain of stones and turning their land upside down. So see, O Messenger, how the end of those who They dared to disobey God and denied His messengers."
m-0331	"And We sent to the tribe of Madyan their brother Shuaib, peace be upon him, and he said to them, ""O my people, worship Allah alone, with no partner for Him. You have no deity worthy of worship other than Him, the Most High, the Most Great. So worship Him sincerely. There has come to you a proof from your Lord of the truth of what I call you to. So give people their rights by giving full measure and weight, and do not withhold from them their rights, lest you oppress them. And do not cause corruption on the earth through disbelief and injustice after it has been set right by the laws of the previous prophets, peace be upon them. That to which I have called you is better for you in this world and the Hereafter, if you are truthful in what I have called you to, acting according to the law of Allah. And do not sit on every road, threatening people with death if they do not give you their wealth, and averting from the straight path of Allah those who believe in Him and do righteous deeds, seeking to make the path of Allah crooked and deviating it in accordance with your desires and repelling people from following it. And remember the favor of Allah upon you when your number was few and He increased you so that you became strong and powerful. And see how was the end of the corrupters on the earth and what befell them of destruction."" And destruction

And if a group of you believed in that with which Allah sent me and a group did not believe in that, then wait, you deniers, for the judgment of Allah, the decisive one between us and you, when His punishment, with which I warned you, descends upon you. And Allah, the Most High, is the best of judges between His servants.

The nobles and leaders of the people of Shu`ayb, who were too arrogant to believe in Allah and follow His Messenger Shu`ayb, peace be upon him, said, “We will surely expel you, Shu`ayb, and those who are with you of the believers, from our homes unless you return to our religion.” Shu`ayb said, denouncing and astonished at their statement, “Shall we follow you in your false religion and creed? Had we been averse to it, we would have known its falsehood.”

And Shu`ayb said to his people, correcting himself, “We have fabricated a lie against Allah if we return to your religion after Allah has saved us from it. And we have no right to change to other than the religion of our Lord unless Allah, our Lord, wills. And our Lord has encompassed all things in knowledge, so He knows what is good for the servants. Upon Allah alone is our reliance for guidance and victory. Our Lord, judge between us and our people with truth, and You are the best of judges.”

The nobles and leaders of the deniers who rejected the call of Allah said, Monotheism is an attempt to persist in insolence and rebellion, warning against following Shu'aib, ""If you follow Shu'aib, you will surely perish."" So the severe earthquake seized the people of Shu'aib, and they became in their homes, fallen down dead. Those who denied Shu'aib were as if they had never resided in their homes or enjoyed them, for they were uprooted, leaving no trace of them, and they were afflicted with loss and destruction in this world and the Hereafter. So Shu'aib turned away from them when he was certain that the punishment would befall them, and said, ""O my people, I have conveyed to you the messages of my Lord and advised you to enter the religion of God and to abandon what you are upon, but you did not listen or obey. So how can I grieve for a people who denied the Oneness of God and denied His Messengers?"""
m-0332	And We did not send to any city a prophet calling them to the worship of Allah and forbidding them from what they were doing of polytheism, but his people denied him, except that We tested them with poverty and hardship, so We afflicted them in their bodies with diseases and illnesses and in their wealth with poverty and need, hoping that they would submit and turn to Allah and return to the truth. Then We replaced the first good state with the bad state, so they became in good health in their bodies and spaciousness and prosperity in their wealth, as a respite for them, and perhaps they would be grateful. But all that did not benefit them, and they did not take heed, and they did not desist from what they were doing, and they said, “This is the way of time with its people, a day of good and a day of evil, and this is what happened to our fathers before.” So We seized them with the punishment suddenly while they were secure, and destruction did not cross their minds.
m-0333	"And if the people of the towns had believed in their messengers and followed them and avoided what Allah forbade them, Allah would have opened for them the doors of goodness from every side, but they denied, so Allah punished them with a devastating punishment because of their disbelief and sins.

Do the people of the towns think that they are safe and secure from the punishment of Allah that it will come to them at night while they are asleep?

Do the people of the towns feel secure that the punishment of Allah will not come to them at noon while they are heedless and busy with their worldly affairs? Allah singled out these two times for mention because man is most heedless at these times, so the coming of the punishment at these times is more terrible and severe.

Do the people of the towns who denied feel secure from Allah’s plan and His respite for them, luring them with what He bestowed upon them in their worldly life as punishment for their plan? No one feels secure from Allah’s plan except the people who are doomed.

Has it not become clear to those who inhabited the earth after the destruction of its previous people because of their sins, so they followed their way of life, that if We willed, We could afflict them because of their sins as We did to their predecessors, and We could seal their hearts so that the truth would not enter them, nor would they hear admonition or reminder.

Those towns The aforementioned are the cities of the people of Noah, Hud, Salih, Lot, and Shuaib. We relate to you, O Messenger, some of their news and what happened to the Messengers of Allah to whom they were sent, as a lesson for those who take heed and a deterrent for the wrongdoers. And indeed, Our Messengers came to the people of the cities with clear proofs of their truthfulness, but they would not believe in what the Messengers brought them because of their transgression and their denial of the truth. And just as Allah sealed the hearts of these aforementioned disbelievers, Allah seals the hearts of the disbelievers in Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And we did not find most of the past generations to be trustworthy or faithful to their covenant, and we did not find most of them to be anything but wicked in obeying Allah and complying with His command."
m-0334	Then We sent after the aforementioned messengers Moses, son of Imran, with Our clear miracles to Pharaoh and his people, but they denied and disbelieved in them out of injustice and obstinacy. So look, O Messenger, with insight, at how We dealt with them and drowned them all in the sight of Moses and his people. That is the end of the corrupters. And Moses said to Pharaoh, conversing and conveying, “I am a messenger from God, the Creator of all creation and the Manager of their affairs and their end. I am worthy of saying nothing about God except the truth, and it is appropriate for me to adhere to it. I have come to you with a clear proof and argument from your Lord for the truth of what I am telling you. So release, O Pharaoh, with me the Children of Israel from your captivity and oppression, and set them free to worship God.” Pharaoh said to Moses, “If you have come with a sign as you claim, then bring it to me and bring it to me so that your claim may be correct and your truth may be established if you are truthful in what you claim that you are the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds.” So Moses threw down his staff and it was transformed into a great serpent, visible to the eye. And he pulled his hand from his pocket or from his wing, and behold, it was white like milk, without leprosy, a sign for Pharaoh. And behold, Her color returned to its original color, like the rest of his body.
m-0335	"The nobles of Pharaoh's people said, ""Moses is a magician who deceives people by making them think that the staff is a snake, but the thing is not what it is. He has vast knowledge of magic and is skilled at it. He wants to expel you all from your land."" Pharaoh said, ""Then what do you advise me, O chiefs, about Moses?"" Those of the leaders and notables of Pharaoh's people who were present at Moses' debate said, ""Delay Moses and his brother Aaron, and send police to the cities and provinces of Egypt so that they may gather for you every magician who has vast knowledge of magic."""
m-0336	"And the magicians came to Pharaoh and said, ""Is there indeed a reward and wealth for us if we defeat Moses?"" Pharaoh said, ""Yes, you will have a reward and closeness to me if you defeat him."" Pharaoh's magicians said to Moses, arrogantly and indifferently, ""O Moses, choose whether you will throw your staff first or we will throw first."" Moses said to the magicians, ""Throw."" So when they threw the ropes and the staffs, they bewitched the eyes of the people, so that what they had done seemed to them to be true, when it was nothing but a mere artifice and imagination. They terrified the people greatly and produced much powerful magic. And God revealed to His servant and messenger Moses, peace be upon him, in that great situation in which God distinguished between truth and falsehood, ordering him to throw what was in his right hand, which was his staff. So he threw it, and behold, it swallowed what they were throwing, and they made people think that it was truth when it was false. So the truth appeared and became clear to those who witnessed and attended it in the matter of Moses, peace be upon him, and that he was the Messenger of God calling to the truth, and the lies that they were doing were invalidated. So all the magicians were defeated in their meeting place, and Pharaoh and his people left, humiliated, defeated, and vanquished. And he went down. The magicians prostrated on their faces to Allah, Lord of the worlds, when they witnessed the great power of Allah. They said, “We believe in the Lord of the worlds.” He is the Lord of Moses and Aaron, and He is the One to Whom worship alone must be directed, without anyone else. Pharaoh said to the magicians, “You believed in Allah before I gave you permission to believe in Him. Your belief in Allah, your belief in Moses, and your acknowledgment of his prophethood are a ruse that you and Moses have devised to expel the people of your city from it and to monopolize its bounties. You will soon know, O magicians, what torment and punishment will befall you. I will cut off your hands and feet, O magicians, on opposite sides. I will cut off the right hand and the left foot, or the left hand and the right foot. Then I will hang you all on the trunks of palm trees as a punishment for you and to terrorize the people.” The magicians said to Pharaoh, “We have become certain that we will return to Allah, and that His punishment is more severe than your punishment. So let us be patient today with your punishment so that we may be saved from the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection.” You do not criticize or deny us, O Pharaoh, except for our belief in and confirmation of the proofs and evidence of our Lord that Moses brought, and neither you nor anyone else can do anything like them. There is no other besides God, to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Our Lord, bestow upon us great patience and steadfastness upon Him, and let us die submitting to Your command, following Your Messenger."
m-0337	"The nobles and leaders of Pharaoh's people said to Pharaoh, ""Do you call on Moses and his people from the Children of Israel to corrupt the people in the land of Egypt by changing their religion to the worship of God alone, with no partner for Him, and abandoning your worship and the worship of your gods?"" Pharaoh said, ""We will kill the sons of the Children of Israel and keep their women alive to serve them, and we will prevail over them by force of kingship and authority."" Moses said to his people from the Children of Israel, ""Seek help from God against Pharaoh and his people, and be patient over what Pharaoh has afflicted you with of hardships in yourselves and your children. Indeed, the earth is God's. He gives it as an inheritance to whomever He wills of His servants. And the good end is for those who fear God, do what He commands and avoid what He prohibits."" The people of Moses from the Children of Israel said to their prophet Moses, ""We have been tested and harmed by the slaughter of our sons and the keeping of our women alive at the hands of Pharaoh and his people before you came to us and after you came to us."" Moses said to them, ""Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy Pharaoh and his people and make you successors in their land after their destruction and see how you act - will you be grateful or ungrateful?"""
m-0338	"And We tested Pharaoh and his people with famine and drought and a decrease in their fruits and crops so that they would remember and be deterred from their misguidance and turn to their Lord with repentance.

So when fertility and provisions came to Pharaoh and his people, they said, “This is for us, as we deserve.” But if drought and famine befell them, they were pessimistic and said, “This is because of Moses and those with him.” Unquestionably, what befell them of drought and famine was only by the decree and predestination of Allah and because of their sins and disbelief, but most of Pharaoh’s people did not know that because they were immersed in ignorance and misguidance.

And Pharaoh’s people said to Moses, “What sign do you bring to us, evidence and proof that you have established to turn us away from the religion of Pharaoh? We will not believe you.”

So We sent upon them a torrential flood that drowned the crops and fruits. We sent locusts that ate their crops and fruits, their doors and roofs and their clothes. We sent lice that spoil the fruits and kill the animals and plants. We sent frogs that filled their vessels, their food and their beds. We also sent blood, so it became Their rivers and wells were filled with blood, and they did not find any water fit for drinking. These are signs from the signs of Allah that none but He can do, separated from one another. Despite all this, the people of Pharaoh were arrogant and disdainful of believing in Allah. They were a people who did what Allah forbade of sins and immorality. They rebelled and rebelled. When the punishment came down upon Pharaoh and his people, they turned to Moses and said, “O Moses, call upon your Lord for us, as He has revealed to you, to lift the punishment through repentance. If you lift from us the punishment we are in, we will believe in what you have brought and follow what you have called us to, and we will set out with you the Children of Israel, and we will not prevent them from going wherever they wish.” So when Allah lifted from them the punishment that He had sent down upon them for a term that they would inevitably reach, and they would be punished during it, and the respite that had preceded them and the lifting of the punishment until it came would not benefit them. At once, they broke their covenants that they had made with their Lord and Moses, and persisted in their disbelief and misguidance. So We took revenge on them when the appointed time for their destruction came, by inflicting Our vengeance upon them. It was their drowning in the sea because they denied the miracles that appeared at the hands of Moses, and they were unaware of these miracles, and that unawareness was the reason for the denial."
m-0339	And We caused the Children of Israel, who were humbled for service, to inherit the east and the west of the earth, which is the land of the Levant, which We blessed by producing crops and fruits and rivers. And the word of your Lord, O Messenger, was fulfilled for the Children of Israel by establishing them in the land because of their patience in the face of the harm of Pharaoh and his people. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people had built of buildings and farms and what they had built of buildings and palaces and other things.
m-0340	"And We crossed the sea with the Children of Israel, and they passed by a people who were dwelling and persisting in worshipping their idols. The Children of Israel said, “Make for us, O Moses, an idol that we may worship and take as a god, just as these people have idols that they worship.” Moses said to them, “Indeed, you people are ignorant of the greatness of Allah and do not know that worship is only due to Allah, the One, the Supreme.”

These people who dwell upon these idols are the destroyer of what they are in of polytheism and the destructive and invalid thing that they were doing of their worship of those idols that do not ward off from them the punishment of Allah when it descends upon them.

Moses said to his people, “Shall I seek for you a god other than Allah to worship besides Him? And Allah is He who created you and preferred you over the people of your time by the multitude of prophets among you and the destruction of your enemy and the signs with which He has singled you out.”"
m-0341	And remember, O Children of Israel, Our favor upon you when We saved you from the captivity of Pharaoh and his people and from the humiliation and disgrace you were in, from the slaughter of your sons and the preservation of your women for service, and from the most hideous and worst of torments upon you, then We saved you as a test from God for you and a great blessing.
m-0342	And Allah, the Almighty, appointed for Moses to commune with his Lord for thirty nights, then He increased the term after that by ten nights, so what Allah had set for Moses to speak to Him for forty nights was completed. And Moses said to his brother Aaron when he wanted to go to commune with his Lord, “Be my successor among my people until I return and make them obey Allah and worship Him, and do not follow the path of those who cause corruption on earth.” And when Moses came at the appointed time, which was the completion of forty nights, and his Lord spoke to him with what He spoke to him of His revelation, His commands, and His prohibitions, he desired to see Allah, so he asked to look at Him. Allah said to him, “You will not see Me,” meaning you will not be able to see Me in this world, but look at the mountain, if it remains in its place when I appear to it, then you will see Me. So when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He made it level with the ground, and Moses fell unconscious. When he recovered from his unconsciousness, he said, “Glory be to You, O Lord, from what is not befitting of Your Majesty. Indeed, I repent to You from asking You to see me in this worldly life, and I am the first of my people to believe in You.”
m-0343	God said, “O Moses, I have chosen you over mankind with My messages to My creation to whom I sent you, and with My speech to you without any mediation. So take what I have given you of My commands and prohibitions, hold fast to them, and act upon them, and be among those who are grateful to God Almighty for what He has given you of His message and for what He has singled you out with His speech.” And We wrote for Moses in the Torah everything he needed in his religion of rulings, an admonition for deterrence and consideration, and a detailed explanation of the duties of what is lawful and unlawful, commands and prohibitions, stories, beliefs, news, and the unseen. God said to him, “Take it with strength,” meaning, take the Torah with seriousness and diligence, and command your people to act according to what God has prescribed in it. For whoever associates others with God, I will show him in the Hereafter the abode of the wicked, which is the Fire of God that He has prepared for His enemies who disobey Him.
m-0344	I will turn away from understanding the arguments and evidences indicating My greatness, My law and My rulings the hearts of those who are arrogant about obeying Me and those who are arrogant towards people without right, so they will not follow a prophet nor listen to him because of their arrogance. And if these arrogant ones see every sign, they will not believe in it because of their turning away and opposing Allah and His Messenger. And if they see the path of righteousness, they will not take it as a path, and if they see the path of misguidance, that is, disbelief, they will take it as a path and a religion. This is because they denied the signs of Allah and neglected to consider them and ponder their implications. And those who denied the signs of Allah and His proofs and the meeting with Allah in the Hereafter, their deeds will be in vain because they lost their condition, which is belief in Allah and belief in His reward. They will not be rewarded in the Hereafter except for the reward of what they used to do in this world of disbelief and sins, which is eternity in the Fire.
m-0345	And the people of Moses, after he had departed from them, took as an idol a calf of their gold, a body without a soul, with a voice. Did they not know that it did not speak to them nor guide them to good? They proceeded to do what they proceeded to do of this heinous matter, and they were wronging themselves, putting things in the wrong place. And when those who worshipped the calf instead of God regretted when Moses returned to them and saw that they had strayed from the right path and departed from the religion of God, they began to acknowledge their servitude and seek forgiveness, and they said, “If our Lord does not have mercy on us by accepting our repentance and covering our sins thereby, we will surely be among the lost, whose deeds have been lost.”
m-0346	When Moses returned to his people from the Children of Israel, angry and sad because God had informed him that he had tempted his people and that the Samaritan had led them astray, Moses said, “Evil is the succession that you have made me succeed after me. Have you hastened the command of your Lord?” That is, have you hastened my coming to you, which was decreed by God Almighty? Moses threw down the tablets of the Torah in anger at his people who worshipped the calf and in anger at his brother Aaron. He grabbed his brother’s head, dragging him towards him. Aaron said, seeking compassion, “O son of my mother, the people have humiliated me and considered me weak and have come close to killing me. Do not make the enemies happy with what you are doing to me, and do not place me in your anger with the people who disobeyed your command and worshipped the calf.” Moses said, when his brother’s excuse became clear to him and he knew that he had not neglected what he had been commanded by God, “My Lord, forgive me for my anger and forgive my brother for what happened between him and the Children of Israel and admit us into Your vast mercy, for indeed, You are more merciful to us than any merciful one.” Indeed, those who took the calf as a god will be afflicted with severe wrath from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world because of their disbelief in their Lord, as we did. And those who have committed evil deeds of disbelief and sins, then returned after committing them to faith and righteous deeds - indeed, your Lord, after sincere repentance, is Forgiving of their deeds, not disgracing them for them. Merciful to them and to all those like them who repent.
m-0347	"And when Moses' anger subsided, he took the tablets after he had thrown them on the ground, and in them was a statement of the truth and mercy for those who fear God and dread His punishment. Moses chose from his people seventy men from among their best and went out with them to Mount Sinai for the time and term that God had promised him that he would meet Him therein with them to repent for what the foolish people of the Children of Israel had done in worshipping the calf. When they reached that place, they said, ""We will not believe in you, O Moses, until we see God plainly, for you have spoken to Him, so show Him."" Then a severe earthquake seized them and they died. Then Moses stood up, supplicating to God and saying, ""My Lord, what shall I say to the Children of Israel when I come to them and You have destroyed their best? If You had wished, You could have destroyed them all before this state, and I am with them, for that is easier for me. Will You destroy us for what the foolish people among us have done? This deed that my people have done in worshipping the calf is nothing but a trial and a test by which You misguide whomever You will of Your creation and guide whomever You will. You are our Guardian and Supporter, so forgive our sins and have mercy on us with Your mercy, for You are the best of those who pardon."" Crime and cover up a sin
And make us among those for whom righteous deeds have been written in this world and in the Hereafter. Indeed, we have returned to You, repentant. God Almighty said to Moses, “My punishment I afflict with it whomever I will of My creation, just as I afflicted those whom I afflicted of your people. And My mercy encompasses all of My creation. So I will write it for those who fear God and dread His punishment, so they perform His obligations and avoid His transgressions, and those who believe in the proofs and evidence of monotheism.”"
m-0348	This mercy I will write for those who fear Allah and avoid His disobedience and follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet who neither reads nor writes, and he is Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, whose description and command they find written for them in the Torah and the Gospel. He orders them to monotheism and obedience and everything that is known to be good and forbids them from polytheism and disobedience and everything that is known to be bad. He makes lawful for them the good things of food, drink and marriage and prohibits for them the bad things of them, such as pork and what they used to consider lawful of food and drink that Allah has forbidden. He removes from them the difficult matters that they were charged with, such as cutting off the place of impurity from the skin and clothing and burning the spoils of war and the inevitable retaliation for the murderer, whether the murder was intentional or accidental. So those who believed in the unlettered prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and acknowledged his prophethood and respected him and glorified him and supported him and followed the Qur’an revealed to him and acted according to his Sunnah, those are the ones who are successful in what Allah has promised to His believing servants. Say, O Messenger, to all people, “Indeed, I am the Messenger of Allah to you all, not to some of you without others. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them.” Divinity and worship should be only for Him, the Most High, the One who is able to create, destroy, and resurrect creation. So believe in God and acknowledge His Oneness and believe in His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, the unlettered Prophet who believes in God and what was revealed to him from his Lord and what was revealed to the prophets before him. Follow this Messenger and commit yourself to doing what he has commanded you of obedience to God, hoping that you will be guided to the straight path.
m-0349	And from the Children of Israel, from the people of Moses, there is a group who are steadfast in the truth, guiding people with it and judging their cases justly. And We divided the people of Moses from the Children of Israel into twelve tribes, the same number as the tribes, and they are the sons of Jacob, each tribe is known by its leader. And We inspired Moses when his people asked him for water when they were thirsty in the wilderness, saying, “Strike the rock with your staff.” So he struck it, and twelve springs of water gushed forth from it. Each tribe of the twelve tribes knew its drinking place. No tribe would interfere with another in drinking from it. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna, which is something similar to gum and tastes like honey, and quail, which is a bird similar to quail. And We said to them, “Eat from the good things We have provided for you.” But they hated that and grew tired of it from their long persistence in it, and they said, “We will not be patient with one food.” And they asked to replace that which is worse with that which is better. And they did not wrong Us when they did not thank God and did not do what God had obligated upon them, but they were wronging themselves when they missed out on all good and exposed themselves to evil and punishment. And remember, O Messenger. The disobedience of the Children of Israel to their Lord, glory be to Him, and to their Prophet Moses, peace be upon him, and their changing the statement they were commanded to say when God said to them, “Dwell in the city of Jerusalem and eat of its fruits and grains and plants wherever and whenever you wish and say, ‘Remove from us our sins and enter the gate, humbly submissive to God.’ We will forgive you your sins and will not hold you accountable for them. And We will increase for the doers of good the good of this world and the Hereafter.” But those who disbelieved among them changed what God commanded them to say, and they entered the gate crawling on their buttocks and said, “A grain in a hair.” So We sent upon them a punishment from the sky, destroying them because of their injustice and disobedience.
m-0350	And ask, O Messenger, these Jews about the news of the people of the village that was near the sea, when its people transgressed on the Sabbath the sanctities of God, as He commanded them to honor the Sabbath and not to catch fish on it. So God tested them and tried them, and their whales would come to them on the Sabbath in large numbers, floating on the surface of the sea. And when the Sabbath was gone, the whales would go into the sea and they would not see anything of them. So they would find a way to trap them in holes on the Sabbath and catch them after it. And as we have described to you of the test and trial of showing the fish on the surface of the water on the day on which it was forbidden for them to catch it and hiding it from them on the day on which it was permissible for them to catch it. Thus do We test them because of their immorality and their departure from the obedience of God.
m-0351	And remember, O Messenger, when a group of them said to another group who were admonishing the transgressors on the Sabbath and forbidding them from disobeying Allah on it, “Why do you admonish a people whom Allah will destroy in this world because of their disobedience to Him, or punish them with a severe punishment in the Hereafter?” Those who were forbidding them from disobeying Allah said, “We admonish them and forbid them so that we may excuse them and fulfill Allah’s obligation upon us in enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong and hoping that they will fear Allah and repent from their disobedience to their Lord and punish them for what He has forbidden them.” So when the group who transgressed on the Sabbath abandoned what I was reminded of and continued in their error and transgression on it and did not respond to what the admonishing group advised them to do, Allah saved those who forbade disobeying Him and seized those who transgressed on the Sabbath with a painful and severe punishment because of their disobedience to Allah and their going out of obedience to Him. So when that group rebelled and transgressed what Allah had forbidden them from doing by not hunting on the Sabbath, Allah said to them, “Be apes, despised and banished from all good.” So they were
m-0352	And remember, O Messenger, when He made this clear, that He would send upon the Jews those who would make them taste the worst of torment and humiliation until the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, your Lord, O Messenger, is swift in punishing those who deserve it because of their disbelief and disobedience. And indeed, He is Forgiving of the sins of those who repent, Most Merciful to them. And We divided the Children of Israel in the land into groups, among them were those who upheld the rights of Allah and the rights of His servants, and among them were those who fell short and wronged themselves. And We tested these with ease in life and abundance in provision, and We also tested them with hardship in life, calamities and misfortunes, hoping that they would return to the obedience of their Lord and repent from disobeying Him. Then came after those whom We described, a bad alternative. They took the Book from their ancestors, read it, taught it, and disobeyed its rulings. They took whatever was presented to them of worldly pleasures from base earnings such as bribery and other things, due to their intense greed and gluttony, and they said with that, “Allah will forgive us our sins,” wishing falsehoods upon Allah. And if these Jews were given a fleeting pleasure of the forbidden kinds, they would take it and consider it permissible, insisting on Their sins and their consumption of what is forbidden. Were not these people made covenants to establish the Torah and act according to what is in it and not to say about Allah except the truth and not to lie about Him? And they knew what was in the Book, but they neglected it and abandoned acting according to it and disobeyed Allah’s covenant with them in that. And the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah, so they obey His commands and avoid His prohibitions. Do these people who take the basest of earnings not understand that what is with Allah is better and more lasting for the righteous? And those who adhere to the Book and act according to what is in it of beliefs and rulings and maintain the prayer within its limits and do not waste its times, then Allah will reward them for their righteous deeds and will not waste them. And remember, O Messenger, when We raised the mountain above the Children of Israel as if it were a cloud shading them, and they were certain that it would fall upon them if they did not accept the rulings of the Torah. And We said to them, “Take what We have given you with strength,” meaning, act according to what We have given you with diligence from you, and remember what is in Our Book of covenants and agreements that We took from you to act according to what is in it so that you may fear your Lord and be saved from His punishment.
m-0353	And remember, O Prophet, when your Lord brought forth the children of Adam from the loins of their fathers and confirmed in them His Oneness by what He deposited in their nature, that He is their Lord, their Creator, and their King. So they acknowledged that to Him, fearing that they would deny it on the Day of Resurrection and not acknowledge anything about it and claim that God’s proof had not been established against them nor had they knowledge of it, but rather they were unaware of it. Or lest you say, “Our fathers before us committed polytheism and broke the covenant, so we followed their example after them. So will We be punished for what those who invalidated their deeds did by making a partner with God in worship?” And just as We have detailed the verses and explained in them what We did to the previous nations, thus do We detail the verses and explain them to your people, O Messenger, hoping that they will turn back from their polytheism and turn to their Lord.
m-0354	"And relate, O Messenger, to your nation the story of a man from the Children of Israel to whom We gave Our proofs and evidence, and he learned them, then he disbelieved in them and threw them behind his back, so Satan overpowered him, and he became one of the lost and destroyed because of his disobedience to his Lord and his obedience to Satan. If We had wanted to raise his status with the signs We gave him, We would have done so, but he inclined to the world and followed his desires and preferred his pleasures and lusts over the Hereafter, and he refused to obey Allah and disobeyed His command. So the example of this man is like that of a dog: if you drive him away or leave him alone, his tongue sticks out in both cases, panting. So too is the one who has stripped himself of the signs of Allah, he remains in his disbelief whether you strive in your call to him or neglect him. This description, O Messenger, is a description of those people who were lost before you brought them guidance and the message. So relate, O Messenger, the news of past nations, for in your informing of that is the greatest miracle, so that perhaps your people will reflect on what you have brought them and believe in you. How ugly is the example of the people who denied the proofs and evidence of Allah, so they rejected them, and they wronged themselves because of their denial of these Arguments and Evidence
Whoever God guides to believe in Him and obey Him is the successful one, and whoever He lets down and does not guide him is the loser and doomed. Guidance and misguidance come from God alone."
m-0355	And We have certainly created for the Fire in which Allah will punish those who deserve punishment in the Hereafter many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not reason, so they do not hope for reward or fear punishment. They have eyes with which they do not see the signs and evidence of Allah, and they have ears with which they do not hear the verses of the Book of Allah or reflect on them. These are like beasts that do not understand what is said to them, nor comprehend what they see, nor do they reason with their hearts between good and evil, so that they can distinguish between them. Rather, they are more astray than them, because beasts see their benefits and harms and follow their shepherd, while they are the opposite. They are the ones who are heedless of faith in Allah and obedience to Him.
m-0356	And to God, glory be to Him, are the most beautiful names that indicate the perfection of His greatness, and all of His names are good, so ask Him by His names whatever you want and leave those who change His names by adding, subtracting, or distorting them, such as calling someone who does not deserve them, like the polytheists calling their gods by them, or giving them a meaning that God and His Messenger did not intend. Then they will be recompensed for the evil deeds that they did in this world, such as disbelief in God, blasphemy regarding His names, and denying His Messenger.
m-0357	"And among those whom We have created is a virtuous group who are guided by the truth and call to it, and by it they judge and do justice to people, and they are the leaders of guidance, whom Allah has blessed with faith and righteous deeds.

And those who deny Our signs, and reject them and do not remember them, We will open for them the doors of provision and the means of livelihood in this world, as a lure for them until they are deceived by what they are in and believe that they are on something, then We will punish them unawares, from where they do not know. This is a punishment from Allah for denying the proofs of Allah and His signs.

And those who deny Our signs are given respite until they think that they will not be punished, so they increase in disbelief and transgression, and thus the punishment is doubled for them. Indeed, My plan is firm, meaning strong and severe, and cannot be repelled by force or by trickery.

Have those who deny Our signs not considered, so they pondered with their minds and realized that there is no madness in Muhammad? He is only a warning to them of Allah’s punishment for their disbelief in Him, if they do not believe, a clear advisor.

Have those who deny Allah’s signs not looked at Allah’s great kingdom and His overwhelming authority in the heavens? And the earth and whatever God Almighty has created in them, so let them ponder that and take heed from it and consider their appointed times, which may be near and they will perish due to their disbelief and be subject to God’s punishment and painful chastisement. So what fear and warning after the warning of the Qur’an will they believe and act upon? Whoever God misguides from the path of guidance has no guide, and He leaves them in their disbelief, confused and hesitant."
m-0358	"The infidels of Mecca ask you, O Messenger, about the Hour, when it will come. Say to them, ""The knowledge of its coming is with Allah. None reveals it except Him. Its knowledge is heavy and hidden from the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth. No angel brought near or prophet sent knows the time of its coming. The Hour will not come except suddenly."" These people ask you about it as if you were eager to know it and are searching for it. Say to them, ""The knowledge of it is only with Allah, who knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth, but most people do not know that none knows that except Allah."""
m-0359	Say, O Messenger, I have no power to bring good to myself nor to ward off evil that befalls it except what God wills. And if I knew the unseen, I would have done the causes that I know would increase my interests and benefits, and I would have avoided the evil that may come before it happens. I am only the Messenger of God. He has sent me to you to fear His punishment and to give good tidings of His reward. A people who believe that I am the Messenger of God and act according to His law.
m-0360	"He is the One Who created you, O people, from one soul, namely Adam, peace be upon him, and created from her his mate, namely Eve, that he might find comfort in her and be reassured. When he had intercourse with her - meaning the type of spouses from the descendants of Adam - she carried a light fluid, then she stood and sat with it and completed the pregnancy. When her birth approached and she became heavy, the spouses called upon their Lord, ""If You should give us a sound, righteous human being, we will surely be among those who thank You for what You have bestowed upon us of a righteous child."" When God provided the spouses with a righteous child, they attributed to God partners in that child whom God alone created, so they worshipped him for other than God. God is exalted and is far above all association. Do these polytheists associate in the worship of God His creatures, when they are not able to create anything, but are created? They cannot support their worshippers or ward off harm from themselves. If they do not create anything, but are created, and cannot ward off harm from those who worship them or from themselves, then how can they take gods with God? This is nothing but the most unjust of injustice and the most abject of foolishness. And if you, O polytheists, call upon these idols which you worshipped besides God to Guidance does not hear your supplications and does not follow you. Your supplication to it and your silence about it are the same, because it does not hear, nor does it see, nor does it guide, nor is it guided. Those whom you worship other than Allah, O polytheists, are owned by their Lord, just as you are owned by your Lord. If you are, as you claim, truthful in that they deserve some worship, then call upon them and let them respond to you. If they respond to you and obtain what you want, otherwise it will become clear that you are liars, slandering Allah with the greatest slander. Do these gods and idols have legs with which they strive with you in your needs, or do they have hands with which they repel you and support you against whoever wants evil and harm for you? Or do they have eyes with which they see and know what they have witnessed and seen of what is hidden from you and you do not see it? Or do they have ears with which they hear and inform you of what you have not heard? If your gods whom you worship do not have any of these tools, then what is the point of your worshipping them when they are devoid of these things by which one can attain benefit or ward off harm? Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists among the idol worshippers: Call upon Your gods whom you have made partners with God in worship, then they have gathered to inflict evil and harm upon me, so do not delay me and hasten to do so, for I do not care about your gods because I rely on the protection of God alone."
m-0361	My protector is Allah, who takes care of me and gives me victory. He is the One who sent down the Qur’an to me with the truth. He takes care of the righteous among His servants and gives them victory over their enemies and does not let them down. And those whom you, O polytheists, call upon other than Allah, cannot help you, nor can they help themselves. And if you, O polytheists, call upon your gods to be upright and correct, they do not hear your call. And you will see, O Messenger, the gods of these polytheists among the idol worshippers facing you as if they were looking at you, but they do not see, because they have no sight or insight.
m-0362	"Accept, O Prophet, you and your nation, the virtues of people’s morals and deeds, and do not ask them for what is difficult for them so that they do not turn away, and command every good word and beautiful action, and turn away from disputing with fools and being equal to the ignorant fools.

And if, O Prophet, Satan’s wrath afflicts you, or you sense from him whisperings and discouragement from good or urging to evil, then turn to Allah, seeking refuge in Him, for He is the Hearer of every word and the Knower of every action.

Indeed, those among His creation who fear Allah and fear His punishment by performing His obligations and avoiding His prohibitions, if they are afflicted by an adversity from Satan’s whisperings, they remember what Allah has enjoined upon them of obedience to Him and repentance to Him, and then they desist from disobeying Allah with insight, taking Allah’s command and disobeying Satan.

And the brothers of the devils, who are the wicked among the misguided of mankind, the devils from the jinn support them in misguidance and temptation, and the devils of the jinn spare no effort in supporting the devils of mankind in misguidance, and the devils of mankind spare no effort in doing what the devils suggest. The Jinn
And if you, O Messenger, do not bring these polytheists a sign, they will say, “Why did you not invent it and fabricate it from yourself?” Say to them, O Messenger, “This is not for me and it is not permissible for me to do it, because God has only commanded me to follow what is revealed to me from Him, which is this Qur’an that I recite to you, as proofs and evidence from your Lord and as clarification guiding the believers to the straight path and as a mercy with which God has mercy on His believing servants.”"
m-0363	And when the Qur’an is recited, listen to it, O people, and be silent in order to understand it, hoping that Allah will have mercy on you through it. And remember, O Messenger, your Lord within yourself, in humility and submission to Allah, fearing Him and with a heart that is fearful of Him. And call upon Him, moderate between loudness and quietness, at the beginning and end of the day. And do not be among those who neglect the remembrance of Allah and are distracted from Him at all times. Indeed, those who are with your Lord from the angels are not too proud to worship Allah, but rather they submit to His commands and glorify Him by night and by day and declare Him free from that which is not befitting of Him. And to Him alone, with no partner, do they prostrate.
m-0364	"Your companions ask you, O Prophet, about the spoils of war on the day of Badr, how you will divide them among them. Tell them, ""The matter is up to Allah and His Messenger."" The Messenger will be in charge of dividing them by the command of his Lord. So fear Allah's punishment and do not rush to disobey Him. Leave disputes and quarrels over these funds. Reconcile yourselves and adhere to the obedience of Allah and His Messenger, if you are believers. Indeed, faith calls to the obedience of Allah and His Messenger. The true believers in Allah are those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when the verses of the Qur'an are recited to them, their faith increases along with their faith, because they ponder its meanings. And upon Allah the Most High they rely, so they do not hope for anyone other than Him, nor do they fear anyone other than Him. Those who are constant in performing the obligatory prayers at their appointed times, and from what We have provided them of wealth, they spend in that which We have commanded them. These are the ones who truly believe, outwardly and inwardly, in what Allah has revealed to them. For them are high positions with Allah, forgiveness for their sins, and a generous provision, which is Paradise."
m-0365	"Just as when you differed over the spoils, Allah took them from you and made them into His share and the share of His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, your Lord commanded you, O Prophet, to go out from the city to meet the caravan of Quraysh, and that was through the revelation that Gabriel brought to you, despite the fact that a group of the believers hated to go out.

A group of the believers argue with you, O Prophet, about fighting after it became clear to them that it would happen, as if they were being driven to death while they were watching it with their own eyes.

And remember, O you who argue, Allah’s promise to you of victory over one of the two groups, the caravan and what it carries of provisions, or the mobilization, which is fighting the enemies and triumphing over them, and you love victory over the caravan rather than fighting. And Allah wants to establish Islam and make it supreme by His command to you to fight the disbelievers and to eradicate the disbelievers by destruction.

So that Allah may honor Islam and its people and eliminate polytheism and its people, even if the polytheists hate that."
m-0366	"Remember the favor of Allah upon you on the day of Badr when you sought victory over your enemy, and Allah answered your prayer, saying, ""Indeed, I will reinforce you with a thousand angels from heaven, one following the other."" And Allah did not make that reinforcement except as good news for you of victory and to calm your hearts and make you certain of Allah's victory for you. And victory comes only from Allah, not from the strength of your strength and power. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in His Kingdom and Wise in His management and law. When Allah casts upon you drowsiness as a security from Him for you from the fear of your enemy that he will overcome you, and He sends down upon you from the clouds pure water to purify you with it from apparent events and remove from you inwardly the whisperings and thoughts of Satan and to strengthen your hearts with patience in battle and to make firm with it the feet of the believers by covering the sandy ground with rain so that the feet do not slip in it. When your Lord revealed, O Prophet, to the angels whom Allah reinforced the Muslims with in the Battle of Badr, ""I am with you, your eyes and I will support you, so strengthen the resolve of those who believe. I will cast into the hearts of those who disbelieve intense fear and humiliation and disgrace, so strike, O believers, the heads of the disbelievers."" And strike from them every limb and joint
That is what happened to the disbelievers of striking their heads, necks and limbs because of their disobedience to the command of Allah and His Messenger. And whoever disobeys the command of Allah and His Messenger, then indeed Allah is severe in punishment for him in this world and the Hereafter
That is the punishment which I hastened for you, O disbelievers, who disobeyed the commands of Allah and His Messenger in this world. So taste it in the life of this world, and for you in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire."
m-0367	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, when you meet those who disbelieve in battle close to you, do not turn your backs to them and flee from them, but stand firm against them. Indeed, Allah is with you and will support you against them. And whoever among you turns his back to them at the time of battle, unless he turns aside to the plot of the disbelievers or withdraws to the group of Muslims present at the battle, wherever they may be, then he has deserved the wrath of Allah and his abode is Hell, and evil is the destination and the return.
m-0368	So you did not kill the polytheists, O believers, on the day of Badr, but Allah killed them when He helped you to do so. And you did not throw when you threw, O Prophet, but Allah threw where He made the throw that you threw reach the faces of the polytheists, and to test the believers in Allah and His Messenger and to bring them through jihad to the highest levels and to make them know His favor upon them so that they may thank Him, glory be to Him, for that. Indeed, Allah is Hearing of your supplications and your words, what you conceal and what you declare. He is Knowing of what is good for His servants. This act of killing the polytheists and throwing them when they were defeated and the good test of the victory of the believers over their enemies is from Allah to the believers, and Allah, in what is to come, will weaken and nullify the plot of the disbelievers until they are humiliated and submit to the truth or perish. If you, O disbelievers, ask Allah to inflict His wrath and punishment on the aggressors and wrongdoers, then Allah has answered your request when He inflicted upon you from His punishment what was a deterrent to you and a lesson for the righteous. So if you, O disbelievers, desist from disbelieving in Allah and His Messenger and fighting His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, It is better for you in this world and the hereafter. If you return to war and fighting Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and fighting his believing followers, we promise to defeat you as you were defeated on the day of Badr. Your unity will not avail you at all, just as it did not avail you on the day of Badr, despite your large number and equipment and the small number and equipment of the believers. God is with the believers with His support and victory.
m-0369	"O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger, obey Allah and His Messenger in what He has commanded you and forbidden you, and do not abandon obedience to Allah and obedience to His Messenger while you hear what is recited to you in the Qur’an of proofs and evidences. And do not be, O believers, in disobeying Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, like the polytheists and hypocrites who, when they hear the Book of Allah recited to them, say, “We have heard with our ears,” while in reality they do not ponder what they have heard nor think about it. Indeed, the worst of what has crawled on the earth from Allah’s creation, in the sight of Allah, are the deaf whose ears are blocked from hearing the truth, so they do not hear; the dumb whose tongues are mute from uttering it, so they do not speak. These are the ones who do not understand Allah’s commands and prohibitions. If Allah had known any good in these people, He would have made them hear the admonitions of the Qur’an and its lessons so that they would understand Allah’s arguments and proofs, but He knew that there is no good in them and that they do not believe. If He had made them hear, assuming and assuming, they would have turned away from faith intentionally and stubbornly after understanding it, and they would have turned away from it and not paid attention to the truth. In one way or another

O you who have believed in Allah as Lord and in Muhammad as a Prophet and Messenger, respond to Allah and the Messenger with obedience when he calls you to what gives you life from the truth, for in responding is the improvement of your life in this world and the hereafter. And know, O believers, that Allah is the One who controls all things and is able to prevent man from what his heart desires. He is the One who should be answered when he calls you, for in His hand is the dominion of all things. And know that you will be gathered for a day about which there is no doubt, and He will reward each according to what he deserves.

And beware, O believers, of a test and trial that will include the wrongdoer and others, and will not be limited to the people of sins or those who have committed sins, but will afflict the righteous with them if they are able to denounce injustice and do not denounce it. And know that Allah is severe in punishment for those who disobey His commands and prohibitions.

And remember, O believers, the blessings of Allah upon you when you were in Mecca, few in number, oppressed, fearing that the disbelievers would seize you quickly, so He made for you a refuge to which you could take refuge, which is Medina, and He strengthened you with His victory over them on the day of Badr and fed you from the good things. Which includes the spoils of war, so that you may thank Him for what He has provided for you and bestowed upon you."
m-0370	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not betray Allah and His Messenger by abandoning what Allah has enjoined upon you and doing what He has forbidden you. Do not be negligent in what Allah has entrusted to you while you know that it is a trust that must be fulfilled. Know, O believers, that your wealth that Allah has entrusted to you and your children that Allah has given you are a test from Allah and a trial for His servants to know whether they will thank Him for it and obey Him in it or be distracted by it instead of Him. Know that with Allah is goodness and a great reward for those who fear Him and obey Him. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if you fear Allah by doing what He has commanded and avoiding what He has forbidden, He will make for you a distinction between truth and falsehood and will erase from you your past sins and cover them from you, so He will not hold you accountable for them. And Allah is the possessor of great bounty.
m-0371	"And remember, O Messenger, when the polytheists of your people in Mecca plotted against you to imprison you or kill you or exile you from your country and plotted against you, and Allah turned their plot back upon them as a recompense for them. And Allah plans, and Allah is the best of planners.

And when the verses of the Noble Qur’an are recited to those who disbelieve in Allah, they say, out of ignorance and stubbornness towards the truth, “We have heard this before. If we wished, we could say something like this Qur’an. This Qur’an that you recite to us, O Muhammad, is nothing but lies of the ancients.”

And remember, O Messenger, the saying of the polytheists of your people, calling upon Allah, “If what Muhammad has brought is the truth from you, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring upon us a severe and painful punishment.”

And Allah, the Most High, would not punish these polytheists while you, O Messenger, are among them, nor would Allah punish them while they seek forgiveness for their sins.

And how could they not deserve the punishment of Allah when they prevent His believing friends from circumambulating the Kaaba and praying in the Sacred Mosque? And they are not the friends of Allah. Indeed, the friends of Allah are only those who fear Him by performing His obligations and avoiding His sins, but most of the disbelievers do not know, so they claim for themselves a matter that others are more deserving of.

And their prayer at the Sacred Mosque was nothing but whistling and clapping, so taste the punishment of being killed and captured on the Day of Badr because of your denial and your actions that only the disbelievers who deny the Oneness of their Lord and the message of their Prophet would undertake.

Indeed, those who denied the Oneness of Allah and disobeyed His Messenger spend their wealth and give it to their likes among the polytheists and the people of misguidance to avert people from the path of Allah and prevent the believers from believing in Allah and His Messenger. So they spend their wealth in that, then the consequence of their spending is regret and sorrow for them because their wealth is gone and they do not obtain what they hoped for from extinguishing the light of Allah and averting people from His path. Then the believers will defeat them in the end, and those who disbelieved will be gathered to Hell and tormented therein.

Allah will gather and disgrace those who disbelieved in their Lord and spent their wealth to prevent people from believing in Allah and averting people from His path, so that Allah may distinguish the wicked from the good, and Allah will make some of the unlawful wealth that was spent to avert people from the religion of Allah. On top of each other, piled up and overlapping, making him into the fire of Hell. These infidels are the losers in this world and the hereafter."
m-0372	Say, O Messenger, to those polytheists of your people who denied the Oneness of Allah, that if they desist from disbelief and enmity towards the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and return to belief in Allah alone and not fighting the Messenger and the believers, Allah will forgive them their previous sins, for Islam wipes out what came before it. And if these polytheists prepare to fight you, O Messenger, after the battle you inflicted upon them on the day of Badr, then the way of the ancients has already been established, which is that if they lied and persisted in their obstinacy, then We will hasten their punishment and chastisement. And fight, O believers, the polytheists until there is no more polytheism and turning away from the path of Allah and no one is worshipped except Allah alone, with no partner for Him, so that the affliction is lifted from the servants of Allah on earth and until religion, obedience and worship are all for Allah alone, without anyone else. If they are deterred from tempting the believers and from associating partners with Allah and turn to the true religion with you, then Allah is not hidden from what they do of abandoning disbelief and entering Islam. And if these polytheists turn away from what you have called them to, O believers, of belief in Allah and His Messenger and abandoning fighting you, and they refuse except to persist in disbelief. And your fighting, then be certain that God is your helper and supporter against them. What an excellent helper and supporter He is for you and His allies against your enemies.
m-0373	Know, O believers, that what you have conquered from your enemy through jihad in the way of Allah, four-fifths of it is for the fighters who were present in the battle, and the remaining fifth is divided into five parts: the first is for Allah and the Messenger, so it is put in the general interests of the Muslims; the second is for the relatives of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who are Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib, for whom one-fifth is given in place of charity, as it is not permissible for them; the third is for orphans, the fourth is for the poor, and the fifth is for the traveler who has no means of support, if you acknowledge the oneness of Allah, obey Him, and believe in what He revealed to His servant Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, of signs, support, and victory on the day He distinguished between truth and falsehood at Badr, the day when the believers and the polytheists met. And Allah is capable of all things, nothing is beyond His power.
m-0374	And remember when you were on the side of the valley closest to the city and your enemy was encamped on the side of the farthest valley and the trade caravan in a place lower than you to the coast of the Red Sea. If you had tried to set a time for this meeting, you would have differed. But God gathered you without an appointment to accomplish a matter that was to be done by the victory of His friends and the defeat of His enemies by killing and capturing. That is so that whoever of them perished would perish because of a proof from God that was established for him and he witnessed it and his excuse was cut off, and so that whoever lives would live because of a proof from God that was established and made clear to him. And indeed, God is Hearing of the statements of both parties. Nothing is hidden from Him. He is Knowing of their intentions. And remember, O Prophet, when God showed you the small number of your enemy in your dream, so you informed the believers of that, and their hearts were strengthened and they dared to fight them. And if your Lord had shown you their large number, your companions would have hesitated to meet them and you would have been cowardly and differed in the matter of fighting. But God saved you from failure and saved you from the consequences of that. Indeed, He is Knowing of the secrets of hearts and the natures of souls. And remember also when the enemies came out to the battlefield and you saw them as few, so you dared to attack them. And He made you little in their eyes so that they would abandon preparations for war against you, so that God might accomplish a matter that was to be done, and so that God’s promise to you of victory and triumph would be fulfilled. So the word of God was supreme, and the word of those who disbelieved was inferior. And to God is the final destination of all matters, so He will reward each according to what he deserves.
m-0375	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if you meet a group of the people of disbelief who have prepared to fight you, then stand firm and do not flee from them and remember Allah much, supplicating and imploring Him to send down victory upon you and triumph over your enemy so that you may be successful. And adhere to the obedience of Allah and the obedience of His Messenger in all your circumstances and do not differ lest your word be divided and your hearts differ and you become weak and your strength and victory go away. And be patient when you meet the enemy. Indeed, Allah is with the patient with aid, victory and support and He will not let them down. And do not be like the polytheists who left their country in arrogance and hypocrisy to prevent people from entering the religion of Allah. And Allah encompasses what they do and nothing is hidden from Him. And remember when Satan made attractive to the polytheists what they came for and what they intended and said to them, “No one will overcome you today, for I am your helper.” So when the two parties met, the polytheists with Satan and the Muslims with the angels, Satan turned back and said to the polytheists, “Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I see what you do not see of the angels who They came to reinforce the Muslims. I fear Allah. So He forsook them and disavowed them. Allah is severe in punishment for whoever disobeys Him and does not repent sincerely. And remember when the polytheists, hypocrites, and those with sick hearts said, while they saw the small number of Muslims and the large number of their enemies, “These Muslims were deceived by their religion and led them to these situations.” And these hypocrites did not realize that whoever relies on Allah and trusts in His promise, Allah will not forsake him. Indeed, Allah is Almighty, and nothing is beyond His power. He is Wise in His management and creation.
m-0376	And if you were to see, O Messenger, the moment when the angels seize the souls of the infidels and snatch them away, while they strike their faces when they approach and strike their backs when they flee, and say to them, “Taste the burning torment,” you would have seen a terrible matter. And this context, even though its cause was the Battle of Badr, is general with regard to every infidel. That punishment that befell the polytheists was because of their evil deeds in their worldly life, and God does not wrong anyone of His creation by the weight of an atom. Rather, He is the just judge who does not act unjustly.
m-0377	What befell the polytheists on that day was the way of Allah in punishing the tyrants of the previous nations, such as Pharaoh and those who preceded him, when they denied the messengers of Allah and rejected His signs. Allah sent down His punishment upon them because of their sins. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and cannot be overcome. He is severe in punishment for those who disobey Him and do not repent from their sin. This is the evil recompense because when Allah bestows a blessing upon a people, He does not take it away from them until they change their good state to a bad state. Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing of the words of His creation and All-Knowing of their conditions, so He carries out upon them what His knowledge and will require. The affair of these disbelievers in this is like the affair of the people of Pharaoh who denied Moses, and like the affair of those who denied their messengers from the previous nations, so Allah destroyed them because of their sins and drowned the people of Pharaoh in the sea. Each of them was doing what he was not supposed to do, such as their denial of the messengers of Allah, their denial of His signs, and their associating others with Him in worship.
m-0378	The worst of what has crawled on the earth in the sight of Allah are the disbelievers who persist in disbelief. They do not believe in the Messengers of Allah, nor do they acknowledge His Oneness, nor do they follow His Law. Among those evil people are the Jews who entered into treaties with you that they would not fight you or support anyone against you, but they broke their covenant time after time, and they do not fear Allah. If you confront these covenant breakers in battle, then bring down upon them a punishment that will strike terror into the hearts of others and disperse their crowds, so that they may remember and not dare to do what the predecessors did. If you fear, O Messenger, a people who are showing signs of treachery, then give them their covenant so that both parties may be equal in knowledge that there is no covenant after today. Allah does not love those who betray their covenants and break their covenants. Let not those who have denied the signs of Allah think that they have escaped and that Allah has no power over them. They will not escape the punishment of Allah. Prepare, O Muslims, to confront your enemies with all the numbers and equipment you can, so that you may thereby instill fear in them. The hearts of the enemies of Allah and your enemies who lie in wait for you and frighten others whose enmity is not apparent to you now, but Allah knows them and knows what they conceal. Whatever you spend of wealth and other things in the way of Allah, little or much, Allah will replace it for you in this world and store up its reward for you until the Day of Resurrection, and you will not decrease the reward of that in the slightest. If they incline to abandon the war and desire to make peace with you, then incline to that, O Prophet, and entrust your affair to Allah and trust in Him, for He is the Hearer of their words, the Knower of their intentions.
m-0379	And if those who have made a covenant with you intend to plot against you, then Allah will suffice you against their deception. Indeed, it is He who has sent down to you His victory and strengthened you with the believers from among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and united their hearts after their division. If you spent the wealth of this world to unite their hearts, you could not be able to do so. But Allah united them upon faith, and they became loving brothers. Indeed, He is Exalted in Might and Wise in His command and plan. O Prophet, indeed Allah is sufficient for you and those who are with you from among the believers against the evil of your enemies. O Prophet, urge the believers in you to fight. If there are twenty of you who are patient when meeting the enemy, they will overcome two hundred of them. But if there are one hundred of you who strive hard Patient ones will overcome a thousand of the disbelievers because they are a people who have no knowledge or understanding of what Allah has prepared for the mujahideen in His cause. They fight for the sake of supremacy on earth and corruption in it. Now Allah has lightened your burden, O believers, because of the weakness in you. If there are a hundred of you who are patient, they will overcome two hundred of the disbelievers. And if there are a thousand of you, they will overcome two thousand of them, by Allah’s permission. And Allah is with the patient ones with His support and victory.
m-0380	It is not appropriate for a prophet to have captives from his enemies so that he would exaggerate in killing to strike terror into their hearts and strengthen the pillars of religion. You, O Muslims, want by taking ransom from the captives of Badr the enjoyment of this world, while God wants to make His religion prevail, by which the Hereafter is attained. God is Almighty, invincible, and Wise in His law. If it were not for a book from God in which the decree and destiny preceded by permitting the spoils and ransom of the captives for this nation, you would have suffered a great punishment because of your taking the spoils and ransom before legislation was revealed regarding them. So eat from the spoils and ransom of the captives, for it is lawful and good, and preserve the rulings of God’s religion and His laws. Indeed, God is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful to them. O Prophet, say to those whom you captured at Badr, “Do not grieve over the ransom that was taken from you. If God knows good in your hearts, He will give you better than what He took from you of wealth by facilitating for you from His bounty much good.” And God fulfilled His promise to Al-Abbas (may God be pleased with him) and others, and He forgives you your sins. And God, the Exalted, is Forgiving of the sins of His servants if they repent. Merciful to them. And if those prisoners whom you have released, O Prophet, want to betray you again, do not despair. They betrayed God before and fought you, but God gave you victory over them. And God is Knowing of what is in the hearts, Wise in managing the affairs of His servants.
m-0381	Those who believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law and emigrated to the abode of Islam or a land where they could worship their Lord and strove in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives, and those who settled the emigrants in their homes and supported them with their wealth and aided the religion of Allah - those are some of them aids of others. As for those who believed and did not emigrate from the abode of disbelief, you are not charged with protecting them and aiding them until they emigrate. And if injustice befalls them from the disbelievers and they seek your aid, then respond to them, except against a people between whom and you there is a firm treaty which they have not broken. And Allah is Seeing of your deeds. I will reward each according to his intention and his deeds. And those who disbelieved are some of them aids of others. And if you, O believers, are not aids of others, there will be on earth a trial for the believers from the religion of Allah and great corruption by turning people away from the way of Allah and strengthening the pillars of disbelief. And those who believed in Allah and His Messenger and left their homes intending the abode of Islam or a land where they could worship their Lord and strove to exalt the word of Allah, and those who aided their emigrant brothers and sheltered them and aided them with wealth and support. Those are the true believers, truly. For them is forgiveness for their sins and a generous and abundant provision in the Gardens of Delight. And those who believed after these Muhajireen and Ansar and emigrated and fought with you in the cause of Allah - those are from you, O believers. They have what you have and are subject to what you are. And those of kinship are more worthy of one another in inheritance in the judgment of Allah than the general Muslims. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things. He knows what is best for His servants, in terms of inheritance from one another in kinship and lineage, but not inheritance by oath and other things that were in the beginning of Islam.
m-0382	This is a declaration from Allah and His Messenger and a declaration of abandoning the covenants that were between the Muslims and the polytheists. So travel, O polytheists, in the land for a period of four months, going wherever you wish, safe from the believers, and know that you will not escape the punishment, and that Allah will humiliate the disbelievers and cause them disgrace in this world and Hell in the Hereafter. This verse is for those with absolute, non-temporary covenants, or for those who have a covenant of less than four months, so they complete four months for them, or for those who had a covenant and broke it. And it is a notification from Allah and His Messenger and a warning to the people on the Day of Sacrifice that Allah is innocent of the polytheists and His Messenger is innocent of them as well. So if you, O polytheists, return to the truth and abandon your polytheism, it is better for you, but if you turn away from accepting the truth and refuse to enter the religion of Allah, then know that you will not escape the punishment of Allah. And warn, O Messenger, those who turn away from Islam of the painful punishment of Allah. The exception to the previous ruling are the polytheists who entered into a covenant with you for a specific period and did not betray the covenant or assist any of the enemies against you, so complete their covenant for them until its limited end. Indeed, Allah loves The righteous who have done what they were commanded to do and have avoided polytheism, treachery and other sins. When the four months in which you have secured the polytheists have passed, declare war on the enemies of Allah wherever they are and target them by besieging them in their strongholds and lie in wait for them on their roads. If they turn back from their disbelief and enter Islam and adhere to its laws of establishing prayer and paying zakat, then leave them alone, for they have become your brothers in Islam. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving to those who repent and return, Merciful to them. If one of the polytheists whose blood and wealth are permissible asks to enter your protection, O Messenger, and desires security, then respond to his request so that he may hear the Noble Qur’an and learn of its guidance, then return him from where he came, secure, in order to establish proof against him. This is because the disbelievers are a people ignorant of the truths of Islam, so they may choose it if ignorance is removed from them.
m-0383	The polytheists should not have a covenant with Allah and His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a covenant at the Sacred Mosque in the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. If they continue to fulfill your covenant, then continue to do the same for them. Indeed, Allah loves those who fear Allah and fulfill their covenants. The nature of the polytheists is to abide by covenants as long as others are victorious. However, if they feel stronger than the believers, then they do not respect kinship or covenants. Do not be deceived by what they do to you at a time of fear from you. They say to you words with their tongues so that you may be pleased with them, but their hearts refuse that, and most of them rebel against Islam and break the covenant. They have exchanged the verses of Allah for the trivial worldly show, so they have turned away from the truth and prevented those who desire Islam from entering it. Their actions are ugly and their deeds are evil. These polytheists are at war with the faith and its people. They do not give weight to the kinship of the believer or his covenant. Their nature is aggression and injustice. If they stop worshipping other than Allah and utter the word of monotheism and adhere to the laws of Islam, such as establishing prayer and paying zakat, then they Your brothers in Islam, we explain the verses and clarify them for people who will benefit from them.
m-0384	If these polytheists break the covenants you have made with them and show disparagement of the religion of Islam, then fight them, for they are the leaders of misguidance, with no covenant or protection until they cease their disbelief and enmity towards Islam. Do not hesitate to fight these people who broke their covenants and worked to expel the Messenger from Mecca, and they are the ones who began to harm you in the first place. Do you fear them or fear meeting them in war? Allah is more deserving of your fear if you are truly believers. O group of believers, fight the enemies of Allah, and He will punish them by your hands and humiliate them with defeat and disgrace, and He will grant you victory over them and make His word supreme and heal your hearts, which have long been filled with sadness and grief due to the plotting of these polytheists, and He will remove the anger from the hearts of the believers. And whoever of these obstinate ones repents, then Allah accepts the repentance of whom He wills, and Allah is All-Knowing of the sincerity of the repentant, Wise in His planning and making and in establishing His laws for His servants. O group of believers, fight the enemies of Allah, and He will punish them by your hands and humiliate them with defeat. And shame and grant you victory over them and make His word supreme and heal your hearts with their defeat which have long been afflicted with sadness and grief from the plotting of these polytheists and remove the anger from the hearts of the believers. And whoever repents from these obstinate ones, then Allah accepts the repentance of whomever He wills. And Allah is Knowing of the sincerity of the repentant’s repentance, Wise in His management and making and establishing His laws for His servants. It is from the way of Allah to test, so do not think, O group of believers, that Allah will leave you without testing so that Allah may know with apparent knowledge the creation who were sincere in their struggle and did not take other than Allah, His Messenger and the believers as confidants and friends. And Allah is Aware of all your deeds and will reward you for them.
m-0385	It is not the business of the polytheists to build the houses of Allah while they declare their disbelief in Allah and make partners for Him. The deeds of these polytheists will be worthless on the Day of Resurrection and their destiny will be eternal in the Fire. Only those who believe in Allah and the Last Day, establish prayer, give zakat, and do not fear the blame of any blamer for Allah’s sake will take care of the houses of Allah and build them. These builders are the ones who are guided to the truth.
m-0386	Have you, O people, considered what you do of watering the pilgrims and maintaining the Sacred Mosque as the faith of those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and strive in the cause of Allah? The state of the believers and the state of the disbelievers is not equal before Allah, because Allah does not accept a deed without faith, and Allah, the Exalted, does not guide to good deeds the people who wrong themselves by disbelief. Those who believed in Allah and left the land of disbelief, intending the land of Islam and spending their wealth and their lives in jihad to raise the word of Allah, these are the ones who have the highest degree with Allah, and those are the ones who have achieved His pleasure. These believing emigrants have good tidings from their Lord of vast mercy and pleasure after which there is no wrath, and their destination is the eternal gardens and everlasting bliss. They will abide in those gardens, and their stay and enjoyment will have no end. This is the reward for what they offered of obedience and righteous deeds in their worldly life. Allah, the Exalted, has a great reward for those who believe and do righteous deeds by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions.
m-0387	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not take your relatives, such as fathers, brothers, and others, as allies, divulging to them the secrets of the Muslims and consulting them in your affairs as long as they are disbelievers and hostile to Islam. And whoever takes them as allies and shows them affection has disobeyed Allah and wronged himself greatly. Say, O Messenger, to the believers: If you prefer fathers, sons, brothers, wives, relatives, the wealth that you have accumulated, the business that you fear will not grow, and the luxurious houses in which you have lived, if you prefer that over the love of Allah and His Messenger and striving in His cause, then await the punishment of Allah and His chastisement upon you. And Allah does not grant success to those who disobey Him.
m-0388	Allah has sent down His victory upon you in many places when you took the necessary measures and put your trust in Allah. On the day of the Battle of Hunayn, you said, “We will not be defeated today” because of your small number. The large number of people deceived you, but it did not benefit you. The enemy appeared to you, but you did not find a refuge in the vast land, so you fled in defeat. Then Allah sent down reassurance upon His Messenger and upon the believers, so they remained steadfast. He reinforced them with soldiers of angels whom they did not see, so He gave them victory over their enemy and punished those who disbelieved. That is the punishment of Allah for those who turn away from His religion and deny His Messenger. Whoever turns back from his disbelief after that and enters Islam, then Allah accepts the repentance of whomever He wills among them and forgives his sin. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
m-0389	O believers, the polytheists are nothing but impurity and filth. So do not allow them to approach the Sacred Sanctuary after this ninth year of the Hijra. And if you fear poverty because their trade has been cut off from you, then Allah will compensate you for it and suffice you from His bounty, if He wills. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of your condition and Wise in managing your affairs. O Muslims, fight the disbelievers who do not believe in Allah, nor believe in the Resurrection and Recompense, nor avoid what Allah and His Messenger have forbidden, nor adhere to the rulings of the Islamic Shariah, from among the Jews and Christians, until they pay the jizyah that you impose on them with their own hands, submissive and humble.
m-0390	The Jews associated partners with God when they claimed that Ezra was the son of God, and the Christians associated partners with God when they claimed that Christ was the son of God. They invented this statement from themselves, and in doing so they do not resemble the statement of the polytheists before them. May God destroy all polytheists. How do they deviate from the truth to falsehood? The Jews and Christians took scholars and worshippers as lords who legislate for them rulings, so they adhere to them and abandon the laws of God. They took Christ Jesus, son of Mary, as a god, so they worshipped him, although God commanded them to worship him alone, without anyone else. He is the true God, there is no god but Him. He is exalted and sanctified from what the people of polytheism and misguidance invent.
m-0391	The infidels want, through their denial, to invalidate the religion of Islam and invalidate the arguments and proofs of God for His Oneness that Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, brought. God refuses except to perfect His religion, make it manifest, and exalt His word, even if the deniers hate that. He is the One who sent His Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, with the Qur’an and the religion of Islam to make it exalted over all religions, even if the polytheists hate the religion of truth, Islam, and its exaltation over religions.
m-0392	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, indeed many of the scholars of the People of the Book and their worshippers take the wealth of people unjustly, such as bribery and other things, and prevent people from entering Islam and avert [people] from the path of Allah. And those who hold on to wealth and do not pay its zakat or take from it the due rights, give them tidings of a painful punishment. On the Day of Resurrection, pieces of gold and silver will be placed in the Fire. When its heat becomes intense, it will burn the foreheads, flanks, and backs of their owners. And it will be said to them as a rebuke, “This is your wealth that you held back and withheld from the rights of Allah, so taste the painful punishment because of your hoarding and your holding on.”
m-0393	The number of months according to the decree of Allah and what was written in the Preserved Tablet is twelve months since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Of these, four are sacred. Allah has forbidden fighting in them: Dhul-Qa'dah, Dhul-Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab. That is the straight religion, so do not wrong yourselves therein, due to the increase in their prohibition and the fact that injustice in them is more severe than in other months, not that injustice in other months is permissible. Fight the polytheists all together as they fight you all together, and know that Allah is with the people of piety, with His support and victory. What the Arabs used to do in the Age of Ignorance of forbidding four months of the year by number, not by specifying the names of the months that Allah has forbidden, so they would delay some of them or advance them and replace them with whatever they wanted from the months of permission according to their need for fighting. Indeed, that is an increase in disbelief by which Satan misleads those who disbelieve. They make lawful what they have delayed from the four months one year and forbid it another year in order to match the number of the four months, so they make lawful what Allah has forbidden of them. Satan has made evil deeds attractive to them, and Allah does not guide the disbelieving people to the truth and right path.
m-0394	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, what is the matter with you, when you are told to go out to jihad in the cause of Allah to fight your enemies, you become lazy and stay in your homes? Have you preferred your worldly fortunes over the pleasures of the Hereafter? What you enjoy in this world is little and fleeting, but the pleasures of the Hereafter that Allah has prepared for the believing mujahidin are abundant and everlasting. If you do not go out, O believers, to fight your enemy, Allah will bring down His punishment upon you and will bring another people who will go out when they are called to jihad and obey Allah and His Messenger. And you will not harm Allah at all by turning away from jihad. He is independent of you, and you are the ones in need of Him. And whatever Allah wills will inevitably happen, and Allah is capable of all things, from the victory of His religion and His Prophet to your exclusion. O group of companions of the Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings be upon him, if you do not go out with him, O believers, when he calls you to jihad, and if you do not support him, Allah has supported him and aided him on the day the infidels of Quraysh expelled him from his city of Mecca, and he was the second of two, he and Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may Allah be pleased with him, and they forced them to a tunnel. In Mount Thawr in Mecca, they stayed there for three nights, then he said to his companion Abu Bakr when he saw that he was afraid for him, “Do not be sad, God is with us with His victory and support.” So God sent down reassurance into the heart of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and aided him with soldiers that no human had ever seen, and they were the angels. So God saved him from his enemy and humiliated his enemies and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of God was the highest. That was by raising the status of Islam, and God is Mighty in His kingdom and Wise in managing the affairs of His servants. In this verse is a great virtue for Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him.
m-0395	Go out, O believers, to fight in the cause of Allah, young and old, in hardship and ease, whatever your condition may be. And spend your wealth in the cause of Allah and fight with your hands to exalt the word of Allah. That going out and giving is best for you in your condition and your end. So do that and go forth and respond to Allah and His Messenger.
m-0396	Allah, the Almighty, rebuked a group of hypocrites who asked permission from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to stay behind from the Battle of Tabuk, explaining that if their departure was for a nearby and easy-to-obtain booty, they would have followed you. However, when they were called to fight the Romans on the outskirts of the Levant in the heat of the day, they were cowardly and stayed behind. They will apologize for staying behind, swearing that they cannot do so, destroying themselves with lies and hypocrisy. Allah knows that they are liars in the excuses they give you. May Allah forgive you, O Prophet, for what you did in abandoning the best and most perfect thing, which is your permission for the hypocrites to sit out of jihad. For what reason did you give them permission to stay behind from the battle so that those who were truthful in their apologies would appear to you and you would learn the liars among them in that. It is not the affair of the believers in Allah, His Messenger, and the Last Day to ask your permission, O Prophet, to stay behind from jihad in the cause of Allah with their lives and wealth. Rather, this is the affair of the hypocrites. Allah is All-Knowing of those who fear Him and guard against Him by performing His obligations and avoiding His prohibitions. Only those who do not believe in Allah and On the Last Day, and they do not do righteous deeds, and their hearts doubt the truth of what you have brought, O Prophet, of Islam and its laws, so they are perplexed in their doubt. If the hypocrites had wanted to go out with you, O Prophet, to jihad, they would have prepared for it with provisions and a mount, but Allah disliked their going out, so the going out was difficult for them by decree and destiny, even though it was commanded to do so by the Shariah, and they were told to stay behind with those who stayed behind, the sick, the weak, the women and the children. If the hypocrites had gone out with you, O believers, to jihad, they would have spread disorder in the ranks, evil and corruption, and they would have hastened to walk among you with gossip and hatred, seeking to tempt you by discouraging you from jihad in the way of Allah. And among you, O believers, are spies who hear your news and convey it to them, and Allah is All-Knowing of these unjust hypocrites, and He will punish them for that. The hypocrites sought to tempt the believers from their religion and turn them away from the way of Allah before the Battle of Tabuk and the exposure of their affair, and they diverted matters to you, O Prophet, in order to invalidate what you have brought, as they did on the Day of Uhud and the Day of the Trench, and they plotted against you until victory came from Allah. And he honored his soldiers and supported his religion, and they hate him. Among these hypocrites are those who ask for permission to sit out of jihad and say, “Do not subject me to the trial that will befall me in the event of going out, from the temptation of women.” These hypocrites have fallen into the great temptation of hypocrisy, for Hell surrounds the disbelievers in God and the Last Day, and none of them will escape.
m-0397	If, O Prophet, joy and spoils befall you, the hypocrites grieve. But if a misfortune befalls you, such as defeat or hardship, they say, “We are men of opinion and planning. We have taken precautions for ourselves by staying behind Muhammad.” And they depart, pleased with what they have done and with the evil that has befallen you. Say, O Prophet, to these slackers, as a rebuke and rebuke: Nothing will befall us except what Allah has decreed for us and written in the Preserved Tablet. He is our helper against our enemies. And upon Allah alone let the believers rely. Say to them, O Prophet: Are you expecting from us anything but martyrdom or victory over you? And we are waiting for you, whether Allah will afflict you with a punishment from Himself, which will destroy you, or at our hands, so that we will kill you. So wait, for we are with you, waiting for what Allah will do with each group of us and of you.
m-0398	Say, O Prophet, to the hypocrites: Spend your wealth however you wish and in whatever condition you wish, willingly or unwillingly. Allah will not accept your expenditures from you, because you are a people who have gone beyond the religion of Allah and His obedience. The reason for not accepting their expenditures is that they concealed disbelief in Allah Almighty and denied His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. They do not come to prayer except reluctantly and do not spend money except unwillingly. They do not hope for the reward of these obligations, nor do they fear punishment for abandoning them because of their disbelief. So do not be impressed, O Prophet, by the wealth of these hypocrites or their children. Allah only wants to punish them with it in this worldly life, through the effort of acquiring it and the calamities that befall them, as they do not expect that from Allah and their souls depart and they die in their disbelief in Allah and His Messenger.
m-0399	And these hypocrites swear to you, O believers, falsely and in vain, that they are of you, but they are not of you. Rather, they are a people who fear, so they swear as a precaution against you. If these hypocrites could find a place of safety and a fortress to protect them, or a cave in a mountain to shelter them, or a tunnel in the earth to save them from you, they would turn to it in haste. And among the hypocrites are those who criticize you for the distribution of the alms. If they get a share of it, they are pleased and remain silent. But if they do not get a share of it, they become angry with you and criticize you. If these who criticize you for the distribution of the alms were content with what Allah and His Messenger have apportioned to them and said, “Allah is sufficient for us. Allah will give us from His bounty and His Messenger will give us from what Allah has given him. We desire that Allah should be gracious to us and make us independent of charity and of the charity of people.” If they did that, it would be better for them and more beneficial.
m-0400	The obligatory zakat is given to the needy who do not own anything, to the poor who do not have enough to suffice them, to the seekers who collect it, and to those whose hearts you reconcile with it, those whose Islam is hoped to be strong or whose faith is beneficial to the Muslims, or to ward off the evil of one of the Muslims. It is given to free slaves and those who have been freed from slavery, and to those in debt to reconcile rifts, and to those who are burdened by debts, without corruption or waste, and who become poor, and to those who fight in the cause of Allah, and to the traveler who has run out of money. This division is an obligation imposed by Allah and decreed, and Allah is Knowing of the interests of His servants, Wise in His management and His law. Among the hypocrites are some who harm the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with words and say that he listens to everything that is said to him and believes it. Say to them, O Prophet, that Muhammad is an ear that listens to every good thing. He believes in Allah and believes the believers in what they tell them, and he is a mercy to those who follow him and are guided by his guidance. And those who harm the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in any way will have a painful and painful punishment.
m-0401	"The hypocrites swear false oaths and make up fabricated excuses to please the believers, but Allah and His Messenger are more deserving and more worthy of their satisfaction by believing in them and obeying them, if they are true believers.

Did these hypocrites not know that the fate of those who fight Allah and His Messenger is the fire of Hell, for they will have eternal torment therein? That fate is humiliation and great disgrace. And from fighting is harming the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, by insulting him and slandering him, Allah forbid.

The hypocrites fear that a surah will be revealed concerning them, informing them of what they conceal in their hearts of disbelief. Say to them, O Prophet, continue in what you are doing of mockery and ridicule. Indeed, Allah will bring out the truth of what you are warning about.

And if you ask them, O Prophet, about what they said of slandering you and your companions, they will say, ""We were only speaking words that we did not intend."" Say to them, O Prophet, ""Was it Allah, the Almighty, His verses, and His Messenger that you were mocking?""

Do not apologize, O hypocrites, for there is no point in your apology. You have disbelieved in this statement that You mocked him. If we pardon a group of you who asked for pardon and were sincere in their repentance, we will punish another group because of their crime with this wicked and false article."
m-0402	The hypocrites, both men and women, are one category in their declaration of faith but their internal disbelief. They command disbelief in God and disobedience to His Messenger, and they forbid faith and obedience, and they hold back their hands from spending in the way of God. They have forgotten God and do not remember Him, so He has forgotten them of His mercy and has not guided them to any good. Indeed, the hypocrites are those who have departed from faith in God and His Messenger. God has promised the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers that their destiny is the fire of Hell, abiding therein forever. It is sufficient punishment for them for their disbelief in God and God’s expulsion of them from His mercy, and for them is an everlasting torment.
m-0403	Your actions, O hypocrites, of mockery and disbelief are like the actions of the previous nations who were on the side of power, wealth and children stronger than you, so they were reassured by the life of this world and enjoyed what was in it of fortunes and pleasures. So you, O hypocrites, enjoyed your share of fleeting desires as those before you enjoyed their fleeting fortunes, and you indulged in lying about Allah as those nations indulged in lying about Allah. Those described with these morals are those whose good deeds in this world and the Hereafter have been lost, and those are the losers for selling the pleasures of the Hereafter for their fortunes in this world. Has not the news of those who have passed on from the people of Noah, the tribe of Aad, the tribe of Thamud, the people of Abraham, the companions of Madyan and the people of Lot reached these hypocrites when the messengers came to them with the revelation and the signs of Allah, but they denied them, so Allah sent down His punishment upon all of them in retaliation for their evil deeds? Allah would not have wronged them, but they were the ones who wronged themselves by denying and disobeying.
m-0404	The believing men and believing women in Allah and His Messenger are supporters of one another. They enjoin upon mankind faith and righteous deeds and forbid them from disbelief and sins and perform the prayer and give the zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger and desist from what they have been forbidden. Those - Allah will have mercy upon them and save them from His punishment and admit them into His Paradise. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in His dominion and Wise in His laws and decrees. Allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever, their delight never departing from them, and dwellings well constructed and pleasant to settle in gardens of residence. And the pleasure of Allah is greater and more sublime than what they are in of delight. That is the promise of the reward of the Hereafter. That is the great success.
m-0405	O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers with the sword and the hypocrites with the tongue and argument, and be firm against both groups. Their abode is Hell, and wretched is their destination. The hypocrites swear by Allah that they have never said anything that would harm the Messenger or the Muslims. Indeed, they are liars. They have said the word of disbelief and thereby turned away from Islam and tried to harm the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Allah did not enable them to do that. The hypocrites did not find anything to criticize or criticize except that Allah, the Most High, bestowed His favor upon them and enriched them with what He opened to His Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, of goodness and blessing. If these disbelievers return to faith and repentance, that is better for them. But if they turn away or continue in their state, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world at the hands of the believers and in the Hereafter in the fire of Hell. They will have no savior to save them or supporter to avert the evil of the punishment from them.
m-0406	And among the poor hypocrites is he who makes a covenant with himself, “If Allah gives him wealth, he will surely give in charity from it and do what the righteous do with their wealth and walk in the path of righteousness.” But when Allah gave them from His bounty, they were stingy in giving charity and spending money in good deeds and turned away, turning away from Islam. The reward for their actions and their consequences was that He increased their hypocrisy upon their hypocrisy, from which they will not be able to get rid until the Day of Judgment. This is because of their breaking the promise they made to themselves and because of their hypocrisy and lies. Did these hypocrites not know that Allah knows what they conceal in their souls and what they talk about in their gatherings of plotting and deceit, and that Allah is the Knower of the unseen, so He will reward them for their deeds that He has counted against them? With the stinginess of the hypocrites, the charitable ones are not safe from their harm. When the rich give in charity a lot of money, they criticize them and accuse them of hypocrisy, and when the poor give in charity from what they can afford, they mock them and say in mockery of them, “What good is this charity of yours?” Allah mocked these hypocrites, and for them is a painful and painful punishment. O Messenger, if you do not ask forgiveness for the hypocrites, God will not forgive them no matter how much you ask forgiveness for them and repeat it, because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger, and God Almighty does not guide those who disobey Him.
m-0407	Those who stayed behind from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) were happy to stay in Madinah, opposing the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), and they hated to fight with him with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. Some of them said to each other, “Do not go forth in the heat.” The Battle of Tabuk was at a time of intense heat. Say to them, O Messenger, “The fire of Hell is more intense in heat, if only they knew that.” Let these hypocrites who stayed behind from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) in the Battle of Tabuk laugh a little in their transient worldly life, and let them weep a lot in the fire of Hell as a reward for what they earned in this world of hypocrisy and disbelief. If Allah returns you, O Messenger, from your battle to a group of hypocrites who are steadfast in hypocrisy and they ask your permission to go out with you to another battle after the Battle of Tabuk, then say to them, “You will never go out with me on any battle, and you will never fight with me an enemy. You were content to stay behind the first time, so stay with those who stayed behind from fighting with the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). And never, O Messenger, pray for any of the hypocrites who died, and do not stand up. On his grave to pray for him because they disbelieved in God Almighty and in His Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, and they died while they were immoral. This is a general rule for everyone whose hypocrisy is known. And do not be impressed, O Messenger, by the wealth and children of these hypocrites. God only wants to punish them with it in this world by making them suffer hardships in this regard and by making them die in their disbelief in God and His Messenger.
m-0408	And if a Surah is revealed to Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and it does not command belief in God, sincerity towards Him, and jihad with the Messenger of God, the wealthy hypocrites will ask your permission, O Messenger, and say, “Leave us with those who sit and are unable to go out.” These hypocrites are content with the disgrace of sitting in their homes with women, children, and those with excuses, and God has sealed their hearts because of their hypocrisy and their failure to fight and go out with the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, in the way of God. They do not understand what is good for them and what is right for them.
m-0409	If these hypocrites did not participate in the invasion, then the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and the believers fought with him with their wealth and their lives. And for them is victory and spoils in this world and Paradise and honor in the Hereafter. And it is they who are the successful. God has prepared for them on the Day of Resurrection gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. And that is the great success.
m-0410	"A group of Arabs from the surrounding areas of Medina came to apologize to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and explained to him their weakness and inability to go out for the conquest. Some people sat back without an excuse, which they showed out of audacity towards the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Those who disbelieved among them will be afflicted with a painful punishment in this world by being killed or otherwise, and in the Hereafter by the Fire. There is no sin on those who have excuses, such as the weak, the sick, and the poor who do not have the money to prepare for the conquest, if they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger and act according to His law. There is no sin on those who do good, such as those who are prevented by an excuse from jihad with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he is sincere to Allah and His Messenger in a way that he is punished by it and held accountable for it. Allah is Forgiving to the doers of good, Merciful to them. Likewise, there is no sin on those who, when they come to you asking you to help them by carrying them to jihad, you say to them, “I do not find any beasts to carry you on,” and they turn away from you with tears in their eyes, grieving over what they have missed of the honor of jihad and its reward, because they did not find anything to spend or anything to carry them. They went out for jihad in the way of Allah

The sin and blame are only on the rich who came to you, O Messenger, asking permission to stay behind. They are the hypocrites. The rich chose for themselves to sit with women and those who have excuses. Allah sealed their hearts with hypocrisy, so faith will not enter them. They do not know the evil end of their stay behind you and their abandonment of jihad with you.

These people who stayed behind from jihad against the polytheists will apologize to you, O believers, when you return from your jihad from the Battle of Tabuk. Say to them, O Messenger, do not apologize. We will not believe you in what you say. Allah has informed us of your affair, which has proven to us your lie. Allah and His Messenger will see your work if you repent from your hypocrisy or persist in it. He will make your deeds in this world apparent to the people. Then you will return after your death to the One from whom the inner and outer aspects of your affairs are not hidden. He will inform you of all your deeds and reward you for them.

The hypocrites will swear to you by Allah, lying and apologizing, when you return to them from the conquest so that you will leave them without questioning. So avoid them and turn away from them in contempt. They are the ones who are evil in their hearts, and their place in the Hereafter is the fire of Hell, as a recompense for what they used to earn of sins and transgressions. These hypocrites swear to you, O believers, falsely so that you may be pleased with them. If you are pleased with them because you do not know their lies, then God is not pleased with these people and others who persist in immorality and disobedience to God and His Messenger."
m-0411	The Bedouins, the inhabitants of the desert, are more disbelieving and hypocritical than the inhabitants of the city, due to their harshness and hardness of hearts, and their distance from knowledge, scholars, and gatherings of preaching and remembrance. Therefore, they are more deserving of not knowing the limits of religion and the laws and rulings that Allah has revealed. Allah is All-Knowing of the condition of all of these people, and is Wise in His management of the affairs of His servants. Among the Bedouins are those who consider what they spend in the way of Allah to be a loss and a penalty. They do not hope for reward for it, nor do they protect themselves from punishment. They await accidents and calamities for you, but evil is upon them, not upon the Muslims. Allah is All-Hearing of what they say, All-Knowing of their corrupt intentions. Among the Bedouins are those who believe in Allah and acknowledge His Oneness, the Resurrection after death, reward and punishment, and consider what they spend in jihad against the polytheists to be a means of seeking the pleasure and love of Allah, and they make it a means of the supplication of the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for him. Indeed, these deeds bring them closer to Allah, the Most High. Allah will admit them into His Paradise. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of what they have done of evil deeds, Most Merciful towards them.
m-0412	And those who preceded the people first to believe in Allah and His Messenger from the Muhajireen who left their people and clan and moved to the abode of Islam and the Ansar who supported the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, against his enemies the infidels and those who followed them with goodness in belief, words and deeds seeking the pleasure of Allah, the Most High, the Most Great. Those are the ones with whom Allah was pleased for their obedience to Allah and His Messenger and they were pleased with Him for the great reward He bestowed upon them for their obedience and faith and prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great success. In this verse there is a commendation of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, and a justification for them and praise for them. Therefore, respecting them is one of the foundations of faith.
m-0413	"And among the people around the city are hypocritical bedouins, and among the people of the city are hypocrites who persisted in hypocrisy and increased in it in transgression to the point that their affair is hidden from you, O Messenger. We know them. We will punish them twice: by killing, captivity, and disgrace in this world, and by the punishment of the grave after death. Then they will be returned on the Day of Resurrection to a great punishment in the fire of Hell. And others from the people of the city and those around it acknowledged their sins, regretted them, and repented from them. They mixed righteous deeds, which are repentance, regret, and confession of sin, and other righteous deeds, with other bad deeds, which are staying away from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and other bad deeds. May Allah guide them to repentance and accept it from them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful to them. Take, O Prophet, from the wealth of these repentant people who mixed righteous deeds with bad deeds, a charity that will purify them from the filth of their sins and raise them from the ranks of the hypocrites to the ranks of the sincere. And pray for them to be forgiven for their sins and ask forgiveness for them for them. Indeed, your prayer and your asking for forgiveness are mercy and reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing of every prayer and saying, Knowing. By the conditions of the servants and their intentions, and every worker will be rewarded for his work

Didn’t these people who stayed behind from jihad and others know that Allah alone is the One who accepts the repentance of His servants and takes the charity and rewards for it, and that Allah is the Accepter of repentance for His servants if they return to His obedience, the Most Merciful to them if they turn to His pleasure

And say, O Prophet, to these people who stayed behind from jihad, work for Allah in what pleases Him, from obeying Him, performing His obligations, and avoiding sins, for Allah will see your work, and His Messenger and the believers, and your affair will be made clear, and you will return on the Day of Resurrection to the One who knows your secret and your public, and He will inform you of what you used to do. And in this is a threat and warning for those who persist in their falsehood and tyranny

And among these people who stayed behind from you, O believers, in the Battle of Tabuk, there are others who were delayed so that Allah may decide concerning them what He will decide, and these are those who regretted what they did, and they are Murarah ibn al-Rabi’, Ka’b ibn Malik, and Hilal ibn Umayyah, and Allah will either punish them or pardon them, and Allah is All-Knowing of who deserves punishment or pardon, and He is Wise in all His words And his actions"
m-0414	The hypocrites who built a mosque to harm the believers and to disbelieve in Allah and to divide the believers so that some of them would pray in it and leave the Quba Mosque where the Muslims pray so that the Muslims would differ and disperse because of that and in anticipation of the one who fought Allah and His Messenger before, namely Abu Amir the corrupt monk, so that it would be a place for plotting against the Muslims and these hypocrites will swear that they only intended goodness and kindness to the Muslims and expansion for the weak who are unable to walk to the Quba Mosque and Allah is witness that they are liars in what they swear and the mosque was demolished and burned. Do not stand up, O Prophet, to pray in that mosque ever, for the mosque that was founded on piety from the first day, which is the Quba Mosque, is more deserving of your standing up to pray in it. In this mosque, there are men who love to purify themselves with water from impurities and filth as they purify themselves with piety and seeking forgiveness for sins and transgressions, and Allah loves those who purify themselves. If the Quba Mosque was founded on piety from the first day, then the mosque of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is also by way of fortiori and more appropriate. Those who founded their building on piety, obedience and pleasing Allah are not equal. And whoever founded his building on the edge of a pit that was about to collapse, and built a mosque to cause harm, disbelief, and division among the Muslims, and that led him to fall into the fire of Hell, and God does not guide the wrongdoing people who transgress His limits. The building of the hypocrites, which they built to cause harm to the mosque of Quba, will continue to be filled with doubt and hypocrisy, remaining in their hearts until their hearts are torn apart by their killing or death or by their deepest regret and repentance to their Lord and their deepest fear of Him. And God is All-Knowing of the doubts that these hypocrites have and what they intended in their building. He is Wise in managing the affairs of His creation.
m-0415	Allah has purchased from the believers their souls in exchange for which they will have Paradise and the bliss that Allah has prepared therein for their sacrifice of their souls and their wealth in the struggle against His enemies to make His word supreme and His religion manifest, so they kill and are killed. This is a true promise binding upon Him in the Torah revealed to Moses, peace be upon him, and the Gospel revealed to Jesus, peace be upon him, and the Qur’an revealed to Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. No one is more faithful to His covenant than Allah to those who fulfill what they have covenanted with Allah. So show joy and let the believers see your transaction with Allah and what He has promised you of Paradise and contentment. That transaction is the great success. Among the characteristics of these believers who will be given the good news of entering Paradise are that they are the repentant ones who return from what Allah hates to what He loves and is pleased with. They have devoted worship to Allah alone and have found in His obedience those who praise Allah for all that He has tested them with, good or evil. They fast, bow in their prayers, and prostrate in them. They command people to do everything that Allah and His Messenger have commanded and forbid them from everything that Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. They perform the duties of Allah and abide by His command. And His prohibition is for those who obey Him and stand at His limits. And give good tidings, O Prophet, to these believers who are characterized by these qualities of the pleasure of God and His Paradise.
m-0416	"It was not appropriate for the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and those who believed to ask for forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were their relatives, after they died in their polytheism and idol worship, and it became clear to them that they were the people of Hellfire because they died in polytheism. And God does not forgive the polytheists, as God Almighty said: “God does not forgive association with Him.” 448 And as He, the Most High, said: “Whoever associates partners with God, God has forbidden him Paradise.” 572

And the seeking of forgiveness for Abraham, peace be upon him, for his polytheist father was only because of a promise he had made to him, which was his saying: “I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, He has been gracious to me.” 1947 So when it became clear to Abraham that his father was an enemy of God, and preaching and reminding did not benefit him, and that he would die a disbeliever, he abandoned him and stopped seeking forgiveness for him and disavowed him. Indeed, Abraham, peace be upon him, was a great supplicant to God, very forgiving of the mistakes made by his people. And God would not lead a people astray after He had bestowed upon them guidance and success until He had made clear to them what they should avoid and what they need in the fundamentals and branches of religion. Indeed, God is Knowing of all things. He has taught you what you did not know. You will know and He has made clear to you what you will benefit from and established the proof against you by conveying His message to you. Indeed, Allah is the Owner of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them. He has no partner in creation, management, worship, and legislation. He gives life to whom He wills and causes to die whom He wills. You have no one but Allah who takes care of your affairs, nor any supporter who can aid you against your enemy."
m-0417	"Allah guided His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to repent to Him and obey Him. Allah accepted the repentance of the emigrants who left their homes and clans for the abode of Islam. He accepted the repentance of the supporters of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, who went out with him to fight the enemies in the Battle of Tabuk in intense heat and with limited provisions and supplies. Allah accepted their repentance after the hearts of some of them almost turned away from the truth, so they inclined towards ease and tranquility. But Allah made them steadfast and strengthened them and accepted their repentance. He is Kind and Merciful to them. And from His mercy towards them is that He bestowed upon them repentance and accepted it from them and made them steadfast in it. Likewise, Allah accepted the repentance of the three supporters who stayed behind, namely Ka`b ibn Malik, Hilal ibn Umayyah, and Murarah ibn al-Rabi`. They stayed behind from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and they were deeply saddened until the earth became too narrow for them, despite its vastness, with grief and regret because of their staying behind, and their souls became too narrow for them because of the worry that befell them, and they became certain that there is no refuge from Allah except to Him. Allah, the Most High, the Most Great, guided them to obedience and return to what pleases Him, the Most High. Allah is the Accepter of Repentance. His servants, the Most Merciful to them
O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, obey Allah's commands and avoid His prohibitions in everything you do and leave, and be with those who are truthful in their oaths and covenants and in every matter of your affairs
It was not appropriate for the people of the city of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and those around them from the inhabitants of the desert to stay behind their families and homes from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, nor to be content for themselves with comfort while the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in fatigue and hardship. This is because they do not suffer thirst, fatigue or famine in their travels and jihad in the cause of Allah, nor do they tread on a land that angers the disbelievers when they tread on it, nor do they inflict death or defeat on the enemy of Allah and their enemy, except that for all of this they are written down as a reward for a righteous deed. Indeed, Allah does not waste the reward of the righteous

Nor do they spend a small or large sum in the cause of Allah, nor do they cross a valley in their journey with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in his jihad, except that the reward of their work is written down for them, so that Allah may reward them better than that with which He rewards them for their righteous deeds."
m-0418	It is not proper for the believers to go out all together to fight their enemy, just as it is not right for them to sit all together. Why should not a group go out from each group to achieve sufficiency and the intended purpose? This is so that those who have gone out may gain an understanding of the religion of God and what was revealed to His Messenger, and warn their people of what they have learned when they return to them, so that they may beware of the punishment of God by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. O you who have believed in God and His Messenger and acted according to His law, begin by fighting the nearest of the disbelievers to the abode of Islam, then the nearest, and let the disbelievers find in you harshness and severity. And know that God is with the righteous, with His support and victory.
m-0419	And when Allah sends down a surah from the surahs of the Qur’an to His Messenger, some of these hypocrites say in denial and mockery, “Which of you has this surah increased his belief in Allah and His verses?” As for those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, the revelation of the surah increased their faith in knowledge of it, contemplating it, believing in it, and acting upon it, and they rejoice in what Allah has given them of faith and certainty. As for those in whose hearts is hypocrisy and doubt in the religion of Allah, the revelation of the surah increases their hypocrisy and doubt in addition to what they were upon before of hypocrisy and doubt, and these people are destroyed while they deny Allah and His verses. Do the hypocrites not see that Allah tests them with famine and hardship and by revealing what they conceal of hypocrisy once or twice every year, and despite that, they do not repent from their disbelief and hypocrisy, nor do they learn a lesson or remember what they witness of the verses of Allah? And when a surah is revealed, the hypocrites wink at its revelation, mocking and angry at what was revealed in it of mentioning their faults and actions, and they say, “Does anyone see you?” They got up from the Messenger, and if no one saw them, they got up and left him, may God’s prayers and peace be upon him, for fear of disgrace. God turned their hearts away from faith because they did not understand or contemplate.
m-0420	There has come to you, O believers, a Messenger from among your people. He is distressed by what you encounter of hardship and suffering. He is anxious for your faith and the improvement of your condition, and he is to the believers full of compassion and mercy. If the polytheists and hypocrites turn away from believing in you, O Messenger, then say to them, “Sufficient for me is God. He suffices me in all that concerns me. There is no true deity except Him. Upon Him I have relied and to Him I have entrusted all my affairs. He is my Supporter and my Helper, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne, which is the greatest of all creation.”
m-0421	The disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah. Was it a strange matter to the people that We sent down the revelation of the Qur’an to a man from among them, warning them of the punishment of Allah and giving good tidings to those who believed in Allah and His messengers that they would have a good reward for what they had put forth of righteous deeds? But when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to them with the revelation of Allah and recited it to them, the deniers said, “Muhammad is a magician, and what he brought is magic.” The falsehood is evident.
m-0422	"Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He rose above the Throne in a manner befitting His Majesty and Greatness. He manages the affairs of His creation. No one can oppose Him in His judgment, and no intercessor can intercede with Him on the Day of Resurrection except after He gives him permission to intercede. So worship Allah, your Lord, who is described by these attributes, and worship Him sincerely. Will you not learn a lesson and take heed from these verses and proofs? To your Lord is your return on the Day of Resurrection, all of you. This is the true promise of Allah. He is the One who begins the creation of creation, then He will restore it after death, and He will find it alive in its original form, so that He may reward those who are truthful to Allah and His Messenger and do good deeds with the best reward in justice. As for those who deny the Oneness of Allah and the message of His Messenger, they will have a drink of intensely hot water that will burn their faces and sever their intestines, and they will have a painful punishment because of their disbelief and misguidance. Allah is the One who made the sun a radiance and made the moon a light, and He determined for the moon phases. By the sun the days are known, and by the moon the months and years are known. Allah, the Most High, did not create the sun and the moon except for a great wisdom and as evidence of the perfection of Allah’s power and knowledge. Arguments and evidence for people who know the wisdom behind the creation of creation
Indeed, in the alternation of night and day and in what God has created in the heavens and the earth of wonders of creation and in what they contain of creativity and order, there are clear proofs and arguments for people who fear God’s punishment, wrath and torment."
m-0423	"Those who do not hope to meet Us in the Hereafter for the reckoning and the recompense that follows for their deeds, because they deny the resurrection and are satisfied with the life of this world instead of the Hereafter and rely on it, and those who are heedless of Our cosmic and legal signs.

Those whose abode is the fire of Hell in the Hereafter is recompense for what they used to earn in their worldly life of sins and transgressions.

Those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and do righteous deeds, their Lord will guide them to the path of Paradise and grant them success in the work that leads to it because of their faith. Then He will reward them by entering Paradise and granting them His pleasure. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Delight.

Their supplication in Paradise will be the glorification of You, O Allah, and the greeting of Allah and His angels to them, and the greeting of one another in Paradise will be, “Peace.” And their last supplication will be their saying, “Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,” meaning thanks and praise to Allah, the Creator of creation and the One who sustains it with His blessings."
m-0424	And if Allah were to hasten the response to people’s prayers in evil as He hastens them to respond to them in good, they would perish. So We leave those who do not fear Our punishment and are not certain of the Resurrection and the Hereafter in their rebellion and insolence, hesitating and bewildered. And when a person is afflicted with hardship, he calls upon Us to relieve that from him, lying on his side, sitting, or standing, according to the state he is in when that hardship befalls him. So when We relieved him of the hardship that befell him, he continued in his former way before the hardship befell him, and he forgot what hardship and affliction he was in, and he abandoned thanking his Lord who relieved him of what had befallen him of affliction. Just as He made it seem good to this person to continue in his denial and stubbornness after Allah relieved him of what he was in of hardship, He made seem good to those who were excessive in lying about Allah and His prophets what they were doing of disobedience to Allah and associating partners with Him. And We have certainly destroyed the nations who denied the messengers of Allah before you, O polytheists, when they associated partners with their Lord and their messengers came to them from Allah with clear miracles and proofs that show the truth of the one who brought them. So these nations were not We destroyed them so that they would believe in their messengers and submit to them. But they deserved destruction. And such destruction do We recompense every criminal who transgresses the limits of Allah. Then We made you, O mankind, a successor upon the earth after the destroyed generations, to see how you will act - good or evil - and We will recompense you according to your deeds.
m-0425	"And when the verses of Allah which We have revealed to you, O Messenger, are recited to the polytheists, those who do not fear the reckoning, nor expect the reward, nor believe in the Day of Resurrection and Resurrection say, ""Bring a Qur'an other than this, or change this Qur'an by making the lawful unlawful and the unlawful lawful, and the promise a threat and the threat a promise, and by dropping what is in it of the faults of our gods and the belittling of our dreams."" Say to them, O Messenger, ""That is not up to me. I only follow in everything I command you and forbid you what my Lord sends down to me and commands me. Indeed, I fear from Allah, if I disobey His command, the punishment of a terrible Day, which is the Day of Resurrection."" Say to them, O Messenger, ""If Allah had willed, I would not have recited this Qur'an to you, nor would Allah have taught it to you. So know that it is the truth from Allah, for you know that I remained among you a long time before my Lord revealed it to me and before I recited it to you. Will you not then use your minds to ponder and reflect?"" No one is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah or belies His verses. Indeed, he who belies the prophets of Allah and His messengers will not succeed. They get the farmer"
m-0426	"These polytheists worship besides Allah that which neither harms them nor benefits them in this world or the Hereafter, and they say, ""We only worship them so that they may intercede for us with Allah."" Say to them, O Messenger, ""Do you inform Allah of something that He does not know about these intercessors in the heavens or on the earth? If there were intercessors in them who could intercede for you with Him, He would know them better than you do."" Allah is far removed from what these polytheists do by associating in His worship that which neither harms nor benefits. People were of one religion, which is Islam, then they differed after that, so some of them disbelieved and some of them remained steadfast on the truth. If it were not for a word that preceded from Allah to grant respite to the disobedient and not to hasten their sins, it would have been decided between them that the people of falsehood among them would be destroyed and the people of truth would be saved. These stubborn disbelievers say, ""Why was not knowledge, evidence, and a tangible sign sent down to Muhammad from his Lord so that we may know that he is right in what he says?"" Say to them, O Messenger, ""No one knows the unseen except Allah. If He wills, He does, and if He wills, He does not do so. So await, O people, Allah's judgment between us and you by hastening His punishment for the one who is false among us."" And I am waiting for the support of the rightful owner"
m-0427	"And when We let the polytheists taste ease and relief and prosperity after hardship and distress and distress that had befallen them, at once they deny and ridicule the verses of Allah. Say, O Messenger, to these mocking polytheists, ""Allah is swift in plotting and enticing and punishing you. If Our guardians whom We send to you record against you what you plot concerning Our verses, then We will call you to account for that."" It is He who guides you, O people, on land on beasts and other animals and on sea in ships until, when you are in them and they sail with a good wind and the passengers rejoice in the good wind, these ships come with a strong wind and the passengers are overwhelmed by the waves, and they are certain that destruction has surrounded them. They sincerely pray to Allah alone and abandon what they used to worship and say, ""If You should save us from this hardship in which we are, we will surely be among those who are grateful to You for Your favors."" But when Allah has saved them from the hardships and terrors, at once they work corruption and disobedience on the earth. O people, the evil of your transgression is only returning to yourselves. You have enjoyment in the fleeting life of this world, then to Us is [the return of] the Day of Resurrection. Your destiny and your return, so we will inform you of all your deeds and hold you accountable for them."
m-0428	The example of the life of this world and what you boast about therein of adornments and wealth is like the example of rain which We send down from the sky to the earth, and with it grows various kinds of plants, some of which are mixed with others, of which people eat fruits and which animals eat. Then, when the beauty and splendor of this land becomes apparent and the people of this land think that they are able to harvest it and benefit from it, Our command and decree comes to it to destroy what is on it of plants and adornments, either by night or by day. So We make these plants and trees harvested and cut down, with nothing in them, as if those crops and plants had never existed before on the face of the earth. Thus will the destruction of what you boast about of your world and its adornments come to pass, and Allah will destroy it and ruin it. And just as We have explained to you, O people, the example of this world and made you aware of its reality, We explain Our proofs and evidence for a people who reflect on the signs of Allah and ponder what will benefit them in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah invites you to His gardens which He has prepared for His friends, and He guides whomever He wills of His creation, and grants him success in finding the straight path, which is Islam.
m-0429	For the believers who worshipped Allah well, obeying Him in what He commanded and prohibited, there is Paradise and more, which is looking at the face of Allah Almighty in Paradise, forgiveness and pleasure, and their faces will not be covered by dust or humiliation, as will the people of Hell. Those who are described by these qualities are the people of Paradise, staying there forever. And those who committed evil deeds in this world, then disbelieved and disobeyed Allah, their recompense for the evil deeds they did will be the same from the punishment of Allah in the Hereafter, and humiliation and disgrace will cover them, and they will have no one to prevent the punishment of Allah from stopping them when He punishes them, as if their faces were covered with a group of the blackness of the dark night. These are the people of Hell, staying there forever.
m-0430	And remember, O Messenger, the Day when We will gather all of creation for the reckoning and recompense. Then We will say to those who associated others with Allah, “Stay where you are, you and your associates whom you used to worship besides Allah, until you see what will be done with you.” Then We will distinguish between the polytheists and those whom they worship, and those who worship besides Allah will disown those who used to worship them. And they will say to the polytheists, “You did not worship Us in this world.” So sufficient is Allah as a witness between us and you. Indeed, we did not know what you used to say and do, and we were, of your worship of Us, unaware of it. In that place of reckoning, every soul will examine its conditions and its past deeds and will be rewarded accordingly, if good, then good, and if evil, then evil. All will be returned to Allah, the Just Judge. So He will admit the people of Paradise to Paradise and the people of Hell to Hell. And what they used to worship besides Allah, as a fabrication against Him, will be removed from the polytheists.
m-0431	Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists: Who provides for you from the sky with what He sends down of rain and from the earth with what He causes to grow in it of various kinds of plants and trees from which you and your livestock eat? And who owns what you and others enjoy of the senses of hearing and sight? And who is it that owns life and death in the entire universe, bringing forth the living and the dead from one another in what you know of the creatures and in what you do not know? And who manages the affairs of the heavens and the earth and what is in them and your affairs and the affairs of all creation? They will answer you that the One who does all of that is God. So say to them: Do you not fear the punishment of God if you worship other than Him? That is God, your Lord. He is the Truth about which there is no doubt, the One deserving of worship alone, with no partner for Him. So what is other than the Truth except misguidance? So how can you be turned away from worshipping Him to worshipping other than Him? Just as these polytheists disbelieved and persisted in their polytheism, the word of your Lord, His judgment, and His decree have come into effect upon those who have departed from the obedience of their Lord to His disobedience and disbelieved in Him, that they do not believe in the Oneness of God or in the prophethood of His Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and they do not act according to his guidance.
m-0432	Say to them, O Messenger, is there among your gods and objects of worship any who initiates the creation of anything from nothing, then annihilates it after creating it, then restores it to its original state before annihilating it? They are not able to claim that. Say, O Messenger, God Almighty alone is the One who creates creation, then annihilates it, then restores it. So how can you turn away from the path of truth to falsehood, which is the worship of other than God? Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, is there among your partners any who guide to the straight path? They are not able to do that. Say to them, God alone guides the one who has gone astray from guidance to the truth. Which of the two is more deserving of being followed, the one who guides alone to the truth, or the one who is not guided due to his lack of knowledge and his misguidance? These are your partners who neither guide nor are guided unless they are guided. So what is the matter with you? How have you equated God with His creation? This is a false judgment. What most of these polytheists follow in making idols gods and believing that they bring one closer to God is nothing but conjecture and assumption, and it does not avail against certainty at all. Indeed, God is All-Knowing of what these polytheists do of disbelief and denial.
m-0433	"It was not possible for anyone to bring this Qur’an from other than Allah, because none of creation is capable of doing so. Rather, Allah sent it down confirming the books that He sent down to His prophets, because the religion of Allah is one. In this Qur’an is a statement and detail of what Allah has prescribed for the nation of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. There is no doubt that this Qur’an was inspired by the Lord of the Worlds. Rather, do they say that Muhammad invented this Qur’an from himself? They know that he is a human being like them. Say to them, O Messenger, then bring a single surah of the same type as this Qur’an in its arrangement and guidance, and seek help in that from everyone you are able to do besides Allah, from mankind and jinn, if you are truthful in your claim. Rather, they hastened to deny the Qur’an when they first heard it, before they pondered its verses, and they disbelieved in what they did not encompass in knowledge, such as the mention of resurrection, recompense, Paradise, Hell, and other things. The truth of what they were promised in the Book had not yet come to them. Just as the polytheists denied Allah’s threat, so did the nations that came before them. So look, O Messenger, how was the end of the wrongdoers. Allah destroyed some of them. By sinking, and some by drowning, and some by other means.

And among your people, O Messenger, are those who believe in the Qur’an, and among them are those who do not believe in it until they die upon that and are resurrected upon it. And your Lord knows best the corrupters who do not believe in it out of injustice, stubbornness, and corruption. So He will punish them for their corruption with the most severe punishment.

And if these polytheists deny you, O Messenger, then say to them, “For me is my religion and my deeds, and for you is your religion and your deeds.” You will not be held accountable for my deeds, and I will not be held accountable for your deeds.

And among the disbelievers are those who hear your true speech and your recitation of the Qur’an, but they are not guided. So are you able to make the deaf hear? Likewise, you are not able to guide these people unless Allah wills their guidance, because they are deaf to hearing the truth and do not understand it.

And among the disbelievers are those who look at you and at the evidence of your true prophethood, but they do not see the light of faith that Allah has given you. So are you, O Messenger, able to create for the blind sight by which they may be guided? Likewise, you are not able to guide them if they are without insight. And all that is for Allah alone.

Indeed, Allah does not wrong people at all by an increase in Their bad deeds or the decrease in their good deeds, but it is people who wrong themselves by disbelief, sin, and disobeying God’s commands and prohibitions."
m-0434	"And on the Day when Allah will gather these polytheists on the Day of Resurrection and Judgment, it will be as if they had not remained in this worldly life except for an hour of a day, knowing one another as they were in this world. Then that knowledge will be cut off and that hour will pass. Those who disbelieved and denied the meeting with Allah, His reward and His punishment will have lost, and they were not successful in achieving the right path in what they did.

And either We show you, O Messenger, during your lifetime some of what We promise them of punishment in this world, or We cause you to die before We show you that in them, then to Us alone will their affair be returned in both cases. Then Allah is Witness over the deeds that they used to do in this world. Nothing of it is hidden from Him, so He will reward them for it with the reward they deserve.

And for every nation that has passed before you, O people, there was a Messenger whom I sent to them as I sent Muhammad to you, calling to the religion of Allah and obedience to Him. So when their Messenger comes in the Hereafter, it will be judged between them with justice, and they will not be wronged in the recompense of their deeds in the least.

And the polytheists among your people will say, O Messenger, “When will the Hour come, if you and those who follow you are truthful in what you promise us?”

Say to them, O Messenger, “No.” I can ward off harm from myself and I cannot bring myself any benefit except what Allah wills to ward off harm from me or bring me any benefit. Every people has a time for the expiration of their term and their appointed time. When the time for their term to expire and their lives to come to an end comes, they will not be delayed from it for an hour, so they will be given respite, nor will their appointed time come before the appointed time. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, “Tell me: If the punishment of Allah comes to you by night or by day, then what is it that you, O criminals, hasten for the punishment to descend upon you?”

Then it will be said to those who wronged themselves by their disbelief in Allah, “Drink the punishment of Allah that is everlasting for you. Are you being punished except for what you used to do in your life of disobeying Allah?”

And these polytheists from your people ask you, O Messenger, about the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, is it true? Say to them, O Messenger, “Yes, by my Lord, it is the truth, there is no doubt about it, and you will not be able to prevent Allah from resurrecting you.” And He will reward you, for you are in His grip and authority."
m-0435	And if every soul that associated partners with Allah and disbelieved in Him had all that is on the earth and could make it a ransom for itself from that punishment, it would ransom itself with it. And those who did wrong concealed their regret when they saw the punishment of Allah befalling them all. And Allah, the Almighty, the Majestic, judged between them with justice, and they were not wronged, because Allah, the Almighty, does not punish anyone except for his sin. Beware, everything in the heavens and on the earth belongs to Allah, the Almighty. None of that belongs to anyone other than Him. Beware, the meeting with Allah, the Almighty, and His punishment of the polytheists will happen, but most of them do not know the truth of that. Indeed, Allah is the Giver of life and the Giver of death. It is not difficult for Him to revive people after their death, just as it is not difficult for Him to cause them to die if He wills to do so, and to Him they will return after their death.
m-0436	O people, there has come to you an admonition from your Lord that reminds you of Allah’s punishment and frightens you with His threat, and it is the Qur’an and what it contains of verses and admonitions to reform your morals and actions. It contains a cure for what is in the hearts of ignorance, polytheism, and all other diseases, and guidance for those who follow it from creation, saving them from destruction. Allah, the Most High, made it a blessing and mercy for the believers and singled them out for that because they are the ones who benefit from faith. As for the disbelievers, it is blindness for them. Say, O Messenger, to all people, by the grace and mercy of Allah, which is what has come to them from Allah of guidance and the religion of truth, which is Islam. So let them rejoice in that, for the Islam to which Allah has called them and the Qur’an that He revealed to Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is better than what they collect from the debris of this world and what is in it of the perishing, vanishing flowers. Say, O Messenger, to these deniers of the revelation, tell me about this provision that Allah has created for you from animals, plants, and good things, and you have made some of it lawful for yourselves and forbidden some of it. Say to them, “Did Allah permit you to do that, or do you say falsehood about Allah and lie? Indeed, they are…” To say falsehood about Allah and lie. And what do those who fabricate lies about Allah on the Day of Judgment, adding to it the prohibition of provisions and sustenance that He did not prohibit for them, think that Allah will deal with them on the Day of Judgment because of their lies and slander against Him? Do they think that He will pardon them and forgive them? Indeed, Allah is full of favor to His creation by not hastening the punishment of those who slandered Him in this world and giving them respite? But most people do not thank Allah for His favor to them in this.
m-0437	And you, O Messenger, are not in any of your affairs, nor do you recite from the Book of God any verses, nor does anyone of this nation do a deed of good or evil, but We are witnesses over you, knowing it when you undertake it and do it, so We preserve it for you and reward you for it. And nothing is hidden from the knowledge of your Lord, O Messenger, not even the weight of a small ant on the earth or in the heaven, nor the smallest of things nor the largest of them, but it is in a book with God, clear and evident, which His knowledge encompasses and His pen has written.
m-0438	Verily, the friends of Allah shall have no fear in the Hereafter of the punishment of Allah, nor shall they grieve over what they have missed of worldly fortunes. The characteristics of these friends are that they are those who believed in Allah and followed His Messenger and what he brought from Allah, and they feared Allah by obeying His commands and avoiding His disobedience. These friends have good tidings from Allah in this worldly life that please them, and in the Hereafter, they will have Paradise. Allah does not fail in His promise nor change it. That is the great success, because it includes salvation from every danger and the attainment of every desired and beloved thing.
m-0439	And let not the saying of the polytheists concerning their Lord and their fabrication of His name and their associating with Him idols and statues grieve you, for Allah is the One Who is unique in complete power and perfect ability in this world and the Hereafter, and He is the Hearer of their words, the Knower of their actions and intentions. Behold, Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and on the earth, from the angels, mankind, jinn, and other than that. And what is the thing that follows those who call upon other than Allah from among the partners? They follow nothing but doubt, and they are only lying in what they attribute to Allah. It is He Who has made for you, O people, the night that you may rest therein and be at rest from the fatigue of movement in seeking a livelihood, and He has made for you the day that you may see therein and strive to seek your provision. Indeed, in the alternation of night and day and the state of their people therein, there is evidence and arguments that Allah alone is worthy of worship for a people who hear these arguments and reflect upon them. The polytheists said, “Allah has taken a son,” as they say, “The angels are daughters of Allah,” or “The Messiah is the son of Allah.” Allah is sanctified and exalted from all that, and He is independent of everything other than Him. To Him belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, so how could He have a son from among those He created? Everything is owned by Him, and you do not have Evidence of what you fabricate of lies Do you say about Allah what you do not know the truth of and the truth of? Say: Indeed, those who fabricate lies about Allah by taking a son and attributing a partner to Himself will not attain what they seek in this world or in the Hereafter. They only enjoy in this world because of their disbelief and lies a brief enjoyment. Then, when their term has come to an end, to Us is their destination. Then We will make them taste the punishment of Hell because of their disbelief in Allah, their denial of the Messengers of Allah, and their rejection of His signs.
m-0440	And tell the unbelievers of Mecca, O Messenger, the story of Noah, peace be upon him, with his people when he said to them, “If my position among you and my reminding you of the proofs and evidences of Allah are too great for you, then upon Allah is my reliance and in Him is my trust. So prepare your affair and call upon your partners, then do not make your affair hidden from you, but rather apparent and exposed. Then decree upon me the punishment and evil that is within your power, and do not give me respite for an hour of the day. If you turn away from my call, then I do not ask you for a reward, for my reward is with my Lord, and my reward is upon Him alone, glory be to Him, without partner. And I was commanded to be among those who submit to His judgment.” So Noah denied his people in what he told them about Allah, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and We made them succeed the deniers on earth, and We drowned those who denied Our proofs. So consider, O Messenger, how was the end of the people whom their Messenger warned of the punishment and wrath of Allah.
m-0441	Then We sent after Noah messengers to their peoples: Hud, Salih, Abraham, Lot, Shuaib, and others. Each messenger came to his people with miracles indicating his message and the truth of what he called them to. But they would not believe or act upon what the people of Noah and the previous nations denied. And just as God sealed the hearts of those peoples so that they did not believe, so He will seal the hearts of those who resembled them after them, who transgressed the limits of God and disobeyed what their messengers called them to of obeying Him, as a punishment for their disobedience. Then after those messengers We sent Moses and Aaron, peace be upon them, to Pharaoh and the nobles of his people with miracles indicating their truthfulness. But they were arrogant about accepting the truth, and they were a people who associate others with God, who denied. So when the truth brought by Moses came to Pharaoh and his people, they said, “Indeed, what Moses brought of signs is only apparent magic.” Moses said to them, astonished at their statement, “Do you say of the truth when it has come to you, ‘It is obvious magic?’ Look at the description of what has come to you and what it contains, you will find it.” The truth is that magicians will not succeed, nor will they win in this world or in the Hereafter. Pharaoh and his chiefs said to Moses, “Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers doing, of worshipping other than God, and that you and Aaron may have greatness and authority in the land of Egypt? But we will not acknowledge that you are two messengers sent to us to worship God alone, with no partner for Him.”
m-0442	"And Pharaoh said, ""Bring me every magician skilled in magic."" So when the magicians came to Pharaoh, Moses said to them, ""Cast down on the ground whatever you have of your ropes and your staffs."" So when they had cast down their ropes and their staffs, Moses said to them, ""Indeed, what you have brought and thrown down is magic. Indeed, Allah will take away what you have brought and will invalidate it. Indeed, Allah does not amend the work of one who strives in the land of Allah with that which He hates and corrupts it by disobeying Him."" And Allah will establish the truth that I have brought to you from Him, and will make it prevail over your falsehood by His words and His command, even though the criminals, the disobedient ones from the family of Pharaoh, may hate it. No one believed in Moses, peace be upon him, despite what he brought them of arguments and evidence, except a few of his people from the Children of Israel, and they feared Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest they tempt them with punishment and turn them away from their religion. Indeed, Pharaoh was a tyrant, arrogant in the land, and he was among those who transgressed the limit in disbelief and corruption. And Moses said, ""O my people, if you believe in Allah, the Most High, and obey His law, then trust in Him and submit to His command and rely upon Allah, if you are [true]."" Submitting to Him in obedience
Then the people of Moses said to him, “Upon God alone, with no partner for Him, we have relied, and to Him we have entrusted our affair. Our Lord, do not give them victory over us, lest that be a trial for us from the religion, or tempt the disbelievers with their victory, and they say, ‘If they were right, they would not have been defeated.’
And save us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people, Pharaoh and his chiefs, because they used to impose upon them hard labor."
m-0443	"And We inspired Moses and his brother Aaron, saying, ""Take for your people houses in Egypt, to be dwellings and refuges in which you may seek refuge. Make your houses places in which you pray when you are afraid, and perform the obligatory prayers at their appointed times. And give good tidings to the believers who obey Allah of a decisive victory and a great reward from Him, the Most High. And Moses said, ""Our Lord, indeed You have given Pharaoh and the nobles of his people adornment of worldly goods, but they have not been grateful to You. Rather, they have used them to mislead [others] from Your way. Our Lord, obliterate their wealth so that they will not benefit from it, and seal their hearts so that they will not expand to faith, so that they will not believe until they see the severe, painful punishment."" Allah, the Most High, said to them, ""Your prayer has been answered regarding Pharaoh and his chiefs and their wealth."" Moses was praying and Aaron was responding to his prayer. From here, the call was attributed to the two of them. So, be steadfast in your religion and continue in your call to Pharaoh and his people to the Oneness of Allah and His obedience. Do not follow the path of those who do not know the truth of My promise and My threat."
m-0444	"And We made the Children of Israel cross the sea until they crossed it, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them unjustly and aggressively, so they went to the sea after them until, when drowning surrounded Pharaoh, he said, ""I believe that there is no god except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the monotheists who submit in obedience and submission."" Now, O Pharaoh, when death has come upon you, do you acknowledge your servitude to God? You disobeyed Him before His punishment came upon you, and you were among the corrupters who turn people away from His path. So repentance will not benefit you at the hour of death and witnessing death and torment. So today We will place you on a high place on the earth with your body, so that those who denied your destruction will look at you, so that you may be a lesson for those who come after you among the people, who will take heed from you, for many people are heedless of Our proofs and evidence, and they do not think about them or take heed. And We certainly settled the Children of Israel in a good and chosen place in the lands of Ash-Sham and Egypt, and We provided them with lawful and good provision from the good things of the blessed land. They did not differ in the matter of their religion except after the knowledge came to them that necessitated their gathering and their unity. And from that is what the Torah contained of the news By the prophethood of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, your Lord, O Messenger, will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection and will decide concerning that over which they differed concerning your affair. He will admit the disbelievers to Hell and the believers to Paradise."
m-0445	If you, O Messenger, are in doubt about the truth of what We have told you, then ask those who read the Book before you from the people of the Torah and the Gospel, for that is established in their books. The certain truth has come to you from your Lord that you are the Messenger of God, and these Jews and Christians know the truth of that and find your description in their books, but they deny that despite their knowledge of it. So do not be among those who doubt the truth of that. And do not be, O Messenger, among those who denied the proofs and evidence of God, lest you be among the losers with whom God is angry and who receive His punishment. Indeed, those upon whom the word of your Lord has come into effect, O Messenger, by expelling them from His mercy and punishing them, do not believe in the proofs of God, nor do they acknowledge His Oneness, nor do they act according to His law. Even if every admonition and lesson came to them until they saw the painful punishment, then at that time they would believe, and their belief would not benefit them.
m-0446	Faith did not benefit the people of a village who believed when they witnessed the punishment, except the people of the village of Yunus bin Matta. When they were certain that the punishment was coming upon them, they repented to Allah, the Most High, with sincere repentance. When the sincerity of their repentance became clear to them, Allah removed from them the punishment of disgrace after it had approached them and left them in this world enjoying themselves until the time of the end of their terms. And if your Lord had willed, O Messenger, to believe for all the people of the earth, they would all have believed in what you have brought them, but He has wisdom in that. He guides whom He wills and misguides whom He wills according to His wisdom. You are not able to force people to believe. And it is not for a soul to believe in Allah except by His permission and guidance, so do not exert yourself in that, for their affair is in Allah’s hands. And Allah places the punishment and disgrace upon those who do not understand His command and prohibition. Say, O Messenger, to your people, “Think and consider what is in the heavens and the earth of the clear signs of Allah. But the signs and lessons and the messengers warning the servants of Allah of His punishment do not benefit a people who do not believe in any of that due to their turning away and stubbornness.” Do these people await anything but a day when they will witness the punishment of Allah? Like the days of their forefathers who denied and passed away before them. Say to them, “O Messenger, await the punishment of God. Indeed, I am with you among those awaiting your punishment.” Then We will save Our messengers and those who believed with them. And just as We saved those, We will save you, O Messenger, and those who believed in you, as a favor from Us and a mercy.
m-0447	Say, O Messenger, to these people: If you are in doubt about the truth of my religion to which I have called you, which is Islam, and about my steadfastness and uprightness upon it, and you hope that I will turn you away from it, then I do not worship under any circumstances any of those whom you worship, from the idols and statues that you have taken, but I worship Allah alone, who will cause you to die and take your souls, and I have been commanded to be among those who believe in Him and act according to His law. And establish yourself, O Messenger, upon the religion of Islam, upright upon it, not deviating from it to Judaism or Christianity or the worship of anything other than Him, and do not be among those who associate gods and rivals in the worship of your Lord, lest you be among those who perish. And although this is addressed to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, it is directed to the entire Ummah. And do not, O Messenger, invoke anything from the idols and statues besides Allah, because they do not benefit or harm. If you do that and invoke them besides Allah, then you are among those who associate partners with Allah and wrong themselves with polytheism and disobedience. And although this is addressed to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, it is directed to the entire Ummah. And do not invoke, O Messenger, anything from the idols and statues besides Allah, because they do not benefit or harm. If you do that and invoke them besides Allah, then you are among those who associate partners with Allah and wrong themselves with polytheism and disobedience. And although this is addressed to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, it is directed to the entire Ummah.
m-0448	And if Allah afflicts you, O Messenger, with hardship or affliction, none can remove that except Him, the Most High, the Most Great. And if He returns you with ease or blessing, none can prevent it from you. Allah, the Almighty, afflicts with ease and hardship whomever He wills of His servants. And He is the Forgiving of the sins of those who repent, the Most Merciful to those who believe in Him and obey Him. Say, O Messenger, to these people, “The Messenger of Allah has come to you with the Qur’an in which is a statement of your guidance. So whoever is guided by Allah’s guidance, then the fruit of his work will return to him. And whoever deviates from the truth and persists in misguidance, then his misguidance and harm will only be upon himself. And I am not entrusted with you until you become believers. I am only a messenger conveying to you that with which I was sent.” And follow, O Messenger, the revelation of Allah that He reveals to you, so act according to it and be patient in obeying Allah, the Most High, and in refraining from disobeying Him, and in the harm of those who harm you in conveying His message until Allah decides His matter concerning them and you. And He, the Almighty, the Most High, is the best of judges, for His judgment includes complete justice.
m-0449	"The speech about the disconnected letters was previously mentioned at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah.

The revelation of the Qur’an and the clarification of its rulings, their details and their rules are for the sake that you worship none but Allah alone, with no partner for Him. Indeed, to you, O people, is a warner from Allah, warning you of His punishment and a bringer of good tidings, giving you good tidings of His reward.

And ask Him to forgive you your sins, then return to Him regretfully. He will grant you good enjoyment in this world with a good life until your appointed time comes. And He will give everyone who has virtue in knowledge and action the full reward of His virtue, without any deficiency. But if you turn away from what I call you to, then I fear for you the punishment of a severe day, which is the Day of Resurrection. This is a severe threat to those who turn away from the commands of Allah Almighty and deny His Messengers.

To Allah is your return after your death, all of you, so beware of His punishment. He, glory be to Him, is able to resurrect you, gather you and reward you.

Indeed, these polytheists conceal disbelief in their hearts, thinking that what their souls conceal is hidden from Allah. Do they not know, when they cover their bodies with their clothes, that nothing is hidden from Allah? Their secret and their public, for He is All-Knowing of everything that their hearts conceal of intentions, consciences, and secrets."
m-0450	Allah has guaranteed the provision of all that creeps on the face of the earth as a favor from Him, and He knows the place where it will settle during its life and after its death, and He knows the place where it will die. All of that is written in a book with Allah, making clear all of that. And it is He who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them in six days, and His Throne was over the water before that, to test you, which of you is best in obedience and deed. And that which is sincere for Allah is in accordance with what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was upon. And if you were to say, O Messenger, to these polytheists among your people, “You will be resurrected alive after your death,” they would hasten to deny it and say, “This Qur’an which you recite to us is nothing but clear magic.”
m-0451	And if We delay the punishment for these polytheists for a known term, they will delay it, but they will surely say in mockery and denial, “What is to prevent this punishment from occurring if it is true?” Unquestionably, on the Day that punishment comes to them, no one will be able to avert it from them, nor will any repeller repel it. And they will be surrounded on every side by a punishment that they used to mock before it befell them. And if We give a person from Us a blessing of health, security, and other things, then We take it away from him, he is indeed desperate of Allah’s mercy, ungrateful for the blessings that Allah has bestowed upon him. And if We expand for a person his worldly life and provide him with abundant provision after a hardship of life, he will surely say at that time, “The hardship has departed from me and the difficulties have disappeared.” He is indeed arrogant with blessings, exaggerating in his pride and haughtiness towards people. But those who are patient over what befalls them of hardship, believing in Allah and hoping for reward from Him, and do righteous deeds, thanking Allah for His blessings, will have forgiveness for their sins and a great reward in the Hereafter.
m-0452	Perhaps, O Messenger, because of the greatness of what you see from them of disbelief and denial, you are abandoning some of what is revealed to you of what God has sent down to you and commanded you to convey, and your chest is constricted by it for fear that they will demand some demands from you in a way that is obstinate, such as saying, “Why was not a great deal of wealth sent down to him or an angel came with him to confirm his message?” So convey to them what I have revealed to you, for you have no duty except to warn of what has been revealed to you, and God is Guardian over all things. He manages all the affairs of His creation.
m-0453	Rather, do these polytheists from Mecca say that Muhammad has fabricated this Qur’an? Say to them, “If the matter is as you claim, then produce ten fabricated surahs like it, and call upon whomever you can from among all of God’s creation to help you produce these ten surahs, if you are truthful in your claim.” If these polytheists, O Messenger, and those who believe with you do not respond to what you call them to, because everyone is unable to do so, then know that this Qur’an was only sent down by God to His Messenger with His knowledge and is not from the words of humans. And know that there is no god to be worshipped in truth except God. So, after this proof has been established against you, are you Muslims who submit to God and His Messenger?
m-0454	Whoever desires by his deeds the life of this world and its enjoyments, We will give them what was allotted to them of the reward for their deeds in the life of this world, complete and undiminished. Those will have nothing in the Hereafter except the fire of Hell, suffering its heat, and the benefit of what they did will depart from them, and their deeds will be in vain because they were not done for the sake of Allah. Is one who has proof and insight from his Lord in what he believes in and calls to by the revelation in which Allah has sent down this proof, and another witness from Him follows it, namely Gabriel or Muhammad, peace be upon them, and this is supported by a third proof from before the Qur’an, which is the Torah, the Book that was sent down to Moses as an Imam and a mercy to whoever believes in it, like one whose concern is the fleeting life with its adornments? Those believe in this Qur’an and act according to its rulings. And whoever disbelieves in this Qur’an from among those who formed parties against the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, his recompense is the Fire, which he will inevitably return to. So do not be in doubt, O Messenger, about the matter of the Qur’an and its being from Allah, the Most High, after the evidence and proofs have testified to that. Know that this religion is the truth from your Lord, but most people do not believe and do not act according to what they have been commanded to do. This is a general guidance for the nation of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
m-0455	"And no one is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah. Those will be brought before their Lord on the Day of Resurrection, so that He may hold them accountable for their deeds, and the witnesses from among the angels, the prophets, and others will say, “Those who lied against their Lord in this world, Allah has become angry with them and has cursed them with a curse that will never cease, because their injustice has become a constant description of them.” These are the unjust who prevent people from the path of Allah that leads to His worship, and they want this path to be crooked by agreeing with their desires, and they are disbelievers in the Hereafter, not believing in resurrection or reward. Those disbelievers would not have escaped Allah in this world, nor would they have had any supporters to prevent them from His punishment. Their torment in Hell will be doubled for them, because they were unable to hear the Qur’an with a beneficial hearing or see the signs of Allah in this universe with a guided vision, because they were preoccupied with the disbelief in which they were established. Those are the ones who lost themselves by inventing lies against Allah, and they lost what they used to invent about the gods that they claimed would intercede for them. In truth, in the Hereafter, they will be the most losers of people in a deal, because they exchanged the lowest levels. In degrees, they will be in Hell, and that is the manifest loss.

Indeed, those who believed in Allah and His Messenger and did righteous deeds and submitted to Allah in all that they were commanded and forbidden - those are the people of Paradise; they will neither die therein nor come out of it ever.

The example of the two groups of disbelief and faith is like that of the blind who does not see, the deaf who does not hear, and the seeing and hearing. The group of disbelievers does not see the truth and follow it, nor does it hear the caller of Allah and be guided by it. As for the group of faith, it has seen the proofs of Allah and heard the caller of Allah and responded to him. Are these two groups equal? ​​Will you not take heed and reflect?"
m-0456	"And We sent Noah to his people, and he said to them, ""Indeed, I am a warner to you of the punishment of Allah, making clear to you what I have been sent with of Allah's commands and prohibitions. I command you not to worship except Allah. Indeed, I fear for you, if you do not single out Allah alone in worship, the punishment of a painful Day."" But the leaders of the unbelievers among his people said, ""Indeed, you are not an angel, but a human being. How could it be that revelation came to you without us? And we do not see that you are followed except by those who are the lowest of us. They only followed you without thinking or deliberation. And we do not see that you have any superiority over us in provision or wealth because you have entered this religion of yours. Rather, we believe that you are liars in what you claim."" Noah said, ""O my people, have you considered? If I am upon a clear proof from my Lord in what I have brought to you, and it has become clear to you that I am upon the truth from Him, and He has given me mercy from Him, which is prophethood and the message, and He has concealed it from you because of your ignorance and arrogance, is it right that we force it upon you while you deny it? We will not do that, but we entrust your affair to Allah until He decides in your affair what He wills."" Noah, peace be upon him, said to his people, ""O my people, I do not ask you On your call to the oneness of God and the sincerity of worship to Him, what you do not give me after your faith, but the reward of my advice to you is from God alone, and it is not my business to expel the believers, for they will meet their Lord on the Day of Resurrection, but I see you as a people who are ignorant when you order me to expel the friends of God and keep them away from me. O my people, who will prevent me from God if He punishes me for expelling the believers? Do you not consider matters and learn what is most beneficial and best for you? I do not say to you that I possess the power to dispose of God’s treasures, nor do I know the unseen, nor am I an angel among the angels, nor do I say to those whom you despise from the weak believers that God will not give you a reward for your deeds, for God alone knows what is in their hearts and breasts, and if I did that, then I would be among the wrongdoers to themselves and to others."
m-0457	"They said, ""O Noah, you have argued with us and prolonged the dispute with us, so bring us what you threaten us with of punishment, if you should be of the truthful in your claim."" Noah said to his people, ""Indeed, it is Allah alone who brings you punishment when He wills, and you will not escape Him if He wants to punish you, because nothing on earth or in heaven is beyond His power."" My advice and my efforts in calling you to faith will not benefit you if Allah wants to misguide you and destroy you. He, glory be to Him, is your Owner, and to Him you will be returned in the Hereafter for reckoning and recompense. But do these polytheists from the people of Noah say, ""Noah invented this statement?"" Say to them, ""If I have invented that about Allah, then upon me alone is the sin of that, and if I am truthful, then you are the criminals and sinners, and I am innocent of your disbelief, denial, and criminality."""
m-0458	And God Almighty revealed to Noah, peace be upon him, when the punishment was due to his people, that none will believe in God except those who had believed before. So do not grieve, O Noah, over what they were doing. And build the ship in our sight and with our command and with our assistance, and you will be in our protection and care, and do not ask me to grant respite to those of your people who wronged themselves with their disbelief, for they will be drowned in the flood. And in the verse, the attribute of the eye is proven for God Almighty in a manner befitting Him, glory be to Him.
m-0459	Noah built the ark, and whenever a group of the leaders of his people passed by him, they mocked him. Noah said to them, “If you mock us today because of your ignorance of the truth of God’s promise, then we will mock you tomorrow when you drown, just as you mock us.” Then you will know, when God’s command comes, who will be afflicted in this world with the torment of God that will humiliate him and in the Hereafter will be a permanent torment that will never end. Until when Our command came to destroy them, as We promised Noah, and water gushed forth forcefully from the oven, which is the place where they bake bread, as a sign of the coming of the torment, We said to Noah, “Take into the ark one of every kind of animal, male and female, and take into it the people of your household, except those against whom the word has already been pronounced, who have not believed in God, such as his son and his wife, and take into it those of your people who have believed with you.” But none believed with him except a few, despite the length of time and residence among them.
m-0460	"And Noah said to those who believed with him, ""Embark in the ship in the name of Allah. Its course will be upon the surface of the water, and in the name of Allah will be the end of its course and its anchoring. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving of the sins of those of His servants who repent and turn to Him. He is Merciful to them, lest He punish them after their repentance."" And it was sailing with them in waves that rose and rose until they became like mountains in their height. Noah called to his son, who was in a place where he had isolated himself from the believers, and said to him, ""O my son, embark with us in the ship and do not be with the disbelievers in Allah, lest you drown."" Noah's son said, ""I will seek refuge in a mountain to protect myself from the water, so that it will prevent me from drowning."" Noah replied, ""There is no one today to prevent the command of Allah and His decree that has come down upon creation of drowning and destruction, except for those upon whom Allah has mercy, so they believed and embarked in the ship with us."" The high waves came between Noah and his son, and he was among those who were drowned and destroyed. And Allah said to the earth after the destruction of Noah's people, ""O earth, drink your water, and O sky, withhold the rain."" And the water decreased and dried up, and the command of Allah was fulfilled for the destruction of Noah's people, and the ship came to rest on Mount Judi. It was said, ""Destruction and distance."" For the unjust people who transgressed the limits of God and did not believe in Him"
m-0461	"And Noah called upon his Lord, saying, ""My Lord, You have promised me that You will save me and my family from drowning and destruction. And this son of mine is of my family. And Your promise is the truth, which cannot be broken. You are the most just of judges and the most just of them."" Allah said, ""O Noah, your son who perished is not of your family whom You promised to save. This is because of his disbelief and his doing of unrighteous deeds. And I forbid you from asking Me about a matter of which you have no knowledge. I advise you lest you be among the ignorant in your asking Me about it."" Noah said, ""O my Lord, I seek refuge and protection in You, lest I ask You for that of which I have no knowledge. And if You do not forgive my sin and have mercy upon me with Your mercy, I will be among those who have cheated themselves of their portions and are destroyed."" Allah said, ""O Noah, descend from the ship to the earth in security and safety from Us and blessings upon you and upon nations from among those with you. And there are nations and groups of wretched people. We will grant them enjoyment in the life of this world until they reach their appointed times. Then a painful punishment will befall them from Us on the Day of Resurrection."""
m-0462	This story which We have related to you, O Messenger, about Noah and his people is from the news of the unseen that We reveal to you. You did not know it, nor did your people, before this statement. So be patient over the denial of your people and their harm to you, as the prophets were patient before. Indeed, the good outcome in this world and the Hereafter is for the righteous who fear God.
m-0463	"And We sent to Aad their brother Hud. He said to them, ""O my people, worship Allah alone. You have no deity worthy of worship other than Him, the Most High, the Most Great. So devote your worship to Him sincerely. You are nothing but liars in your association with Allah. O my people, I do not ask of you any reward for what I call you to, of sincere worship of Allah and abandoning the worship of idols. My reward for calling you to Him is only from Allah who created me. Will you not use reason and distinguish between truth and falsehood?"" O my people, seek Allah's forgiveness and faith in Him, then repent to Him for your sins. If you do that, He will send down rain upon you in succession and abundance, and your good deeds will increase, and He will add strength to your strength through the multitude of your offspring, and blessings will continue upon you. Do not turn away from what I have called you to, persisting in your crimes. They said, ""O Hud, you have not brought us a clear proof of the truth of what you are calling us to, and we will not abandon our gods that we worship because of what you say, nor will we believe in what you claim."" He said to them, ""I call Allah to witness to what I have called you to."" I say and I call you to witness that I am innocent of what you associate with God of rivals and idols. So look and strive, you and those of your alleged gods, to harm me, and do not delay that for the blink of an eye. That is because Hud is completely confident that no harm will come to him from them or their gods. We only say that some of our gods have driven you mad because of your prohibition of worshipping them. He said to them, “I call God to witness to what I say and I call you to witness that I am innocent of what you associate with God of rivals and idols. So look and strive, you and those of your alleged gods, to harm me, and do not delay that for the blink of an eye. That is because Hud is completely confident that no harm will come to him from them or their gods. I have put my trust in God, my Lord and your Lord, the Owner of all things and the Disposer of them. Nothing will come to me except by His command, and He is Able to do all things. There is nothing that moves on this earth except that God is its Owner and it is in His authority and control. My Lord is on a straight path, that is, just in His judgment, law, and command.” The doer of good will be rewarded for his goodness and the wrongdoer for his wrongdoing.

If you turn away from what I call you to, which is the oneness of God and the sincerity of worship to Him, then I have conveyed to you the message of my Lord to you and the proof has been established against you. And since you do not believe in God, He will destroy you and bring another people who will succeed you in your homes and your wealth and will be sincere in worship to God and you will not harm Him at all. Indeed, my Lord is Guardian over all things. It is He who protects me from you harming me.

And when Our command came to punish the people of Hud, We saved from it Hud and the believers by grace and mercy from Us. And We saved them from a severe punishment which God had inflicted on `Ad, so that nothing could be seen except their dwellings.

And those were `Ad who disbelieved in the signs of God and disobeyed His messengers and obeyed the command of every arrogant person who does not accept the truth nor submit to it.

And they pursued in this world a curse from God and His wrath on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, `Ad denied their Lord and denied His messengers. Unquestionably, away and destruction be `Ad, the people of Hud, because of their polytheism and their disbelief in the favor of their Lord."
m-0464	"And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, and he said to them, ""O my people, worship Allah alone. You have no god worthy of worship other than Him, the Most High, the Most Great. So worship Him sincerely. He is the One who began your creation from the earth by creating your father Adam from it and made you inhabiters of it. So ask Him to forgive you your sins and return to Him in sincere repentance. Indeed, my Lord is near to whoever sincerely worships Him and desires repentance from Him. He answers him when he calls upon Him."" Thamud said to their prophet Salih, ""We had hoped that you would be a master among us who was obeyed before this statement that you made to us. Do you forbid us from worshipping the gods that our fathers worshipped? And indeed, we are in grave doubt about your call to worship Allah alone?"" Salih said to his people, ""O my people, tell me, if I am upon a proof from Allah and He has given me from Him prophethood and wisdom, then who can avert from me the punishment of Allah the Most High if I disobey Him and do not convey the message and advise you? You only increase me in misguidance and distance from good."" And, O my people, this is the she-camel of Allah, which He has made for you a proof and a sign that indicates my truthfulness in what I call you to, so leave her to eat. In the land of Allah, you are not responsible for its provision, nor do you touch it by hamstringing it. If you do that, you will be seized from Allah by a punishment close to its hamstringing. But they denied him and slaughtered the she-camel. Salih said to them, “Enjoy your life in your country for three days, for the punishment will descend upon you after that. This is a promise from Allah that will not be denied. It will inevitably come to pass.” So when Our command came to destroy Thamud, We saved Salih and those who believed with him from destruction by mercy from Us, and We saved them from the humiliation and disgrace of that Day. Indeed, your Lord, O Messenger, is the Strong, the Exalted in Might. And from His strength and might is that He destroyed the tyrannical nations and saved the messengers and their followers. And the mighty blast seized the wrongdoers Thamud, so they became in their homes dead, lifeless, falling on their faces, motionless. As if they had never lived in their homes in the speed of their disappearance and annihilation. Indeed, Thamud denied the signs and proofs of their Lord. Indeed, away with Thamud and expulsion from the mercy of Allah. How wretched and humiliated they are."
m-0465	"And the angels came to Abraham giving him and his wife the good news of Isaac and Jacob after him. They said, ""Peace."" He said in response to their greeting, ""Peace."" So he went quickly and brought them a fat roasted calf for them to eat from. When Abraham saw that their hands could not reach the calf that he had brought to them and they did not eat from it, he disapproved of that from them and felt fear in himself and concealed it. The angels said when they saw what was in Abraham of fear, ""Do not fear. Indeed, we are the angels of your Lord, sent to the people of Lot to destroy them."" And Abraham's wife Sarah was standing behind the curtain listening to the speech, so she laughed in amazement at what she heard. So we gave her the good news through the tongues of the angels that she would give birth to a son from her husband Abraham who would be called Isaac, and her son would live, and after Isaac she would have a grandson from him, who is Jacob. Sarah said when she was given the good news of Isaac, astonished, ""Woe to me! How can I have a son when I am old and my husband is in a state of old age and decrepitude? Indeed, having a son from someone like me and my husband with old age is something amazing."" The messengers said to her, ""Do you wonder at the command and decree of God? The mercy and blessings of God be upon you, O people of The House of Prophecy He is the Most High, Praiseworthy in His attributes and actions, Possessor of glory and majesty in them.

When the fear that had overcome Abraham because the guests did not eat the food had gone away and the good news of Isaac and Jacob came to him, he continued to argue with Our messengers about what We had sent them with, regarding the punishment and destruction of the people of Lot.

Abraham is very patient, does not like to hasten punishment, and often supplicates to God and prays to Him. He is repentant and returns to God in all his affairs.

The messengers of God said, O Abraham, turn away from this argument about the people of Lot and seeking mercy for them, for the punishment has become due upon them and the command of your Lord has come, which He has decreed for them to destroy them, and a punishment from God will descend upon them that will not be averted from them nor repelled."
m-0466	"And when Our angels came to Lot, their coming grieved him and he was distressed because he did not know that they were messengers of Allah, so he feared for them from his people and said, ""This is a day of trial and hardship."" And the people of Lot came walking quickly to him seeking immorality, and before their coming they used to approach men with lust instead of women. So Lot said to his people, ""These are my daughters, marry them, for they are purer for you than what you desire."" And he called them his daughters because the prophet of the nation is like a father to them, so fear Allah and beware of His punishment and do not disgrace me by assaulting my guest. Is there not among you a man of sound mind who will forbid those who want to commit immorality and prevent them from doing so? 

The people of Lot said to him, ""You knew before that we have no need or desire for women, and you know what we want."" That is, we only want men and we have no desire to marry women. 

He said to them when they refused to do anything except immorality, ""If I had against you strength and supporters with me, or could rely on a clan that would protect me from you, I would come between you and what you desire."" The angels said, ""O Lot, we are messengers of your Lord. We have been sent To destroy your people, and they will never reach you. So leave this city, you and your family, with the remainder of the night, and let none of you look back, lest he see the punishment and be afflicted with it. But your wife who betrayed you with disbelief and hypocrisy will be afflicted with what afflicted your people of destruction. The time of their destruction is the morning, and it is a time that is near. So when Our command came to bring down the punishment upon them, We turned the upper part of their city in which they lived into its lower part, and We turned it upside down and rained down upon them stones of hardened, solid clay, one next to the other, one after the other, marked with Allah by a known sign, unlike the stones of the earth. And these stones that Allah rained down upon the people of Lot from the disbelievers of Quraysh are not far from being rained down with the like of them. In this is a threat to every disobedient and rebellious person against Allah ... The people of Lot, the infidels of Quraysh, were unlikely to be rained down with the like of it, and this is a threat to every disobedient person who rebels against God."
m-0467	"And We sent to Madyan their brother Shu`ayb, and he said, “O my people, worship Allah alone; you have no deity worthy of worship other than Him, the Most High, the Most Great. So worship Him sincerely, and do not diminish people’s rights in their measures and scales. Indeed, I see you in ease of life, and I fear for you, because of diminishing the measure and the scale, the punishment of a Day that will encompass you.” And, “O my people, give full measure and weight in justice, and do not diminish people’s rights in all their possessions, and do not travel through the land doing evil deeds and spreading corruption. Indeed, what remains for you after giving full measure and weight from lawful earnings is better for you than what you take by cheating and similar unlawful earnings, if you truly believe in Allah, so obey His command. And I am not a watcher over you, counting your deeds.” They said, “O Shu`ayb, does this prayer that you are constantly performing command you to abandon what our fathers worshipped of idols and statues, or to refrain from disposing of our wealth by whatever means we can of deceit and cunning?” And they said, mocking him, “Indeed, you are the Forbearing.” Al-Rashid
Shuaib said, O my people, have you considered if I am on a clear path from my Lord in what I call you to of sincere worship of Him and in what I forbid you from of corrupting wealth and He has provided me from it a vast, lawful and good provision? And I do not want to disobey you and commit a matter that I have forbidden you from, and I do not want in what I command you to do and forbid you except to reform you to the best of my ability and capacity. And my success in finding the truth and trying to reform you is not except with God, upon God alone I have relied and to Him I return in repentance and turning back."
m-0468	O my people, do not let my enmity and hatred and separation from the religion I follow lead you to stubbornness and insistence on what you are upon of disbelief in Allah, lest you be afflicted with what afflicted the people of Noah or the people of Hud or the people of Salih of destruction. The people of Lot and what befell them of torment are not far from you, neither in the home nor in time. And ask your Lord for forgiveness for your sins, then return to His obedience and continue in it. Indeed, my Lord is Merciful, abundant in love and affection for whoever repents to Him and returns to Him. He has mercy on him and accepts his repentance. In the verse, there is proof of the attribute of mercy and love for Allah the Most High, as befits Him, the Most Glorified. They said, “O Shu’aib, we do not understand much of what you say. Indeed, we see you as weak among us. You are not one of the great ones, nor one of the leaders. And were it not for the consideration of your tribe, we would have stoned you to death.” His people were from their religion, and you have no value or respect in our hearts. He said, “O my people, my tribe is more honorable and valuable to you than Allah, and you have cast aside the command of your Lord and placed it behind your backs, not following it or obeying it.” You will end with His prohibition. Indeed, my Lord encompasses what you do. Nothing of your deeds, even the weight of an atom, is hidden from Him. He will reward you for them sooner or later. O my people, do all that you can in your own way and condition. Indeed, I am a persistent worker in my way and in what my Lord has given me of calling you to monotheism. You will soon know who among us will be afflicted with a punishment that will humiliate him and who among us is a liar in his statement, “I or you?” And await what will befall you. Indeed, I am with you among those who await. This is a severe threat to them. And when Our command came to destroy the people of Shu`ayb, We saved Our Messenger Shu`ayb and those who believed with him by mercy from Us. And the blast seized those who did wrong from the sky and destroyed them, so they became in their homes, kneeling on their knees, dead, motionless. As if they had never resided in their homes for a period of time. Away with Madyan, for God destroyed it and disgraced it, just as Thamud was removed. These two tribes shared in being removed and destroyed.
m-0469	"And We sent Moses with Our proofs of Our Oneness and an argument that is clear to whoever sees it and ponders it with a sound heart that it indicates the Oneness of Allah and the lie of everyone who claims divinity other than Him, glory be to Him, the Most High.

We sent Moses to Pharaoh and his great followers and the nobles of his people, but Pharaoh disbelieved and ordered his people to follow him, but they obeyed him and disobeyed the command of Moses. There is no right guidance or right direction in Pharaoh’s command, but rather it is ignorance, misguidance, disbelief and stubbornness.

Pharaoh will lead his people on the Day of Resurrection until he enters them into the Fire. How ugly is the entrance they will enter.

And Allah followed them in this world with the punishment that He hastened for them in it of drowning in the sea, a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection likewise another curse by entering them into the Fire. How evil is that which has come together for them and has been repeated upon them of the punishment of Allah and the curse of this world and the Hereafter."
m-0470	That which We have mentioned to you, O Messenger, of the news of the towns whose people We destroyed, We inform you of it. And of those towns there are those whose traces remain, and of them there are those whose traces have been erased, so that nothing of them remains. And their destruction was not without a reason or sin that they deserved, but they wronged themselves by their polytheism and their corruption in the land. So their gods, whom they used to call upon and ask to avert harm from them, did not benefit them when the command of your Lord came to punish them. And their gods did not increase them except in destruction, devastation, and loss. And just as I seized the people of the unjust towns with punishment for disobeying My command and denying My messengers, I will seize others of the towns when they wronged themselves by disbelieving in God, disobeying Him, and denying His messengers. Indeed, His punishment is painful, severe.
m-0471	"Indeed, in Our taking of the people of the previous unjust towns, there is a lesson and a sermon for whoever fears the punishment of Allah and His torment in the Hereafter, that Day when all people will be gathered for accountability and recompense, and all creation will witness it.

And We do not delay the Day of Resurrection from you except for the expiration of a limited period in Our knowledge, neither more nor less than Our estimation of it by Our wisdom.

The Day of Resurrection will come, no soul will speak except by the permission of its Lord. Among them will be the wretched, deserving of torment, and the happy, to whom We have bestowed bliss.

As for those who were wretched in this world due to the corruption of their belief and the evil of their deeds, the Fire will be their abode. Therein, from the severity of the torment they are in, will be sighing and breathing, and these are the most hideous and ugly sounds. They will remain in the Fire forever as long as the heavens and the earth endure. Their torment will not cease or end, but will be permanent and certain, except for what your Lord wills of bringing out the disobedient monotheists after a period of their stay in the Fire. Indeed, your Lord, O Messenger, is the Doer of what He will ... And they are the most hideous and ugly of voices, remaining in the Fire forever as long as the heavens and the earth endure. Their torment will not cease or end, but it is permanent and certain, except for what your Lord wills of bringing out the disobedient monotheists after a period of their stay in the Fire. Indeed, your Lord, O Messenger, is the Doer of what He wills. As for those whom Allah has granted happiness, they will enter Paradise, abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except for the group whom Allah willed to delay, and they are the disobedient monotheists. They will remain in the Fire for a period of time, then they will be brought out of it to Paradise by the will and mercy of Allah. And your Lord will give these happy ones in Paradise a gift that will not be cut off from them."
m-0472	So, O Messenger, do not be in doubt about the falsehood of what these polytheists of your people worship. They do not worship of idols except like what their fathers worshipped before. And We will surely fulfill for them what We promised them, complete and undiminished. This is a directive to the entire nation, even though its wording is directed to the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace. And We gave Moses the Book, which is the Torah, and his people differed about it. So a group believed in it and others disbelieved in it, as your people did with the Qur’an. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord that He does not hasten the punishment for His creation, the decree of God would have come upon them in their worldly life, destroying the deniers and saving the believers. And indeed, the disbelievers among the Jews and polytheists, O Messenger, are in doubt about this Qur’an, disquieting. And indeed, all those different peoples whose stories We have mentioned to you, O Messenger, your Lord will surely pay them in full the reward of their deeds on the Day of Resurrection. If good, then good, and if evil, then evil. Indeed, your Lord is All-Aware of what these polytheists do. Nothing of their deeds is hidden from Him. And in this there is a threat and warning to them.
m-0473	So, O Prophet, stand firm as your Lord has commanded you, you and those who repent with you, and do not transgress what Allah has set for you. Indeed, your Lord is All-Seeing of all the deeds that you do. Nothing is hidden from Him, and He will reward you for them. Do not incline toward these unjust disbelievers, lest the Fire befall you. And you will have no helper besides Allah to support you and take care of your affairs. Perform the prayer, O Prophet, in the most perfect manner at both ends of the day, in the morning and the evening, and at some hours of the night. Indeed, doing good deeds expiates past sins and erases their traces. The command to establish the prayer and the statement that good deeds eliminate bad deeds is an admonition for those who learn from it and remember. And be patient, O Prophet, in the prayer and in the face of the harm that you receive from the polytheists of your people, for Allah does not waste the reward of those who do good in their deeds.
m-0474	Why were there not remnants of good and righteous people from the past centuries who would forbid the people of disbelief from their disbelief and from corruption on earth? Only a few of those people believed, so God saved them because of that from His punishment when He seized the wrongdoers and followed the majority of them who wronged themselves with what they enjoyed of worldly pleasures and comforts, and they were criminals and wrongdoers by following what they enjoyed, so the punishment was justified upon them. And your Lord, O Messenger, would not destroy a city while its people were righteous on earth, avoiding corruption and injustice. Rather, He destroyed them because of their injustice and corruption.
m-0475	And if your Lord had willed, He could have made all mankind one group on one religion, which is the religion of Islam. But He, glory be to Him, did not will that, so mankind will continue to differ in their religions, and that is what His wisdom requires. Except for those upon whom your Lord has mercy, so they believe in Him and follow His Messengers, for they do not differ in the Oneness of God and what the Messengers brought from God. And His wisdom, glory be to Him, the Most High, required that He created them different, a group miserable and a group happy, and each one is facilitated for what he was created for. And in this way, the promise of your Lord is fulfilled in His judgment and destiny, that He, glory be to Him, will fill Hell with the jinn and mankind who followed Satan and his soldiers and were not guided to faith.
m-0476	And We relate to you, O Prophet, from the news of the Messengers who were before you, everything you need to strengthen your heart to carry out the burdens of the message. And in this Surah and what it contains of news, there has come to you a statement of the truth that you are upon, and there has come to you in it an admonition by which the disbelievers are deterred and a reminder by which the believers in God and His Messengers are reminded. And say, O Messenger, to the disbelievers who do not acknowledge the Oneness of God: Do what you are doing according to your condition and method in resisting the call and harming the Messenger and those who respond to him, for we are working according to our position and method of steadfastness in our religion and carrying out God’s command, and await the outcome of our command, for we are awaiting the outcome of your command. And in this there is a threat and warning to them. And say, O Messenger, to the disbelievers who do not acknowledge the Oneness of God: Do what you are doing according to your condition and method in resisting the call and harming the Messenger and those who respond to him, for we are working according to our position and method of steadfastness in our religion and carrying out God’s command, and await the outcome of our command, for we are awaiting the outcome of your command. And in this there is a threat and warning to them. And to God Glory be to Him, the Most High. He knows everything that is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and to Him all matters will return on the Day of Resurrection. So worship Him, O Prophet, and entrust your affair to Him. Your Lord is not unaware of what you do, good or evil, and He will reward each one according to his deeds.
m-0477	"The disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

Indeed, We have sent down this Qur’an in the language of the Arabs so that you, O Arabs, may understand its meanings and comprehend them and act in accordance with its guidance

We relate to you, O Messenger, the best of stories by revealing to you this Qur’an, although you were, before its revelation to you, among those unaware of this news, not knowing anything about it."
m-0478	Mention, O Messenger, to your people the words of Joseph to his father: “Indeed, I saw in a dream eleven stars, and the sun and the moon. I saw them prostrating to me.” This vision was good news for the high status that Joseph, peace be upon him, had attained in this world and the Hereafter. Jacob said to his son Joseph: “O my son, do not mention this vision to your brothers, lest they envy you and be hostile to you and plot to destroy you. Indeed, Satan is an enemy to man, manifest in his enmity.” And just as your Lord showed you this vision, so He will choose you and teach you the interpretation of what people see in their dreams, which will be interpreted in reality. He will complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob with prophethood and messengership, just as He had completed it before upon your fathers Abraham and Isaac with prophethood and messengership. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing of whom He chooses from among His servants. He is Wise in managing the affairs of His creation.
m-0479	"The story of Joseph and his brothers contains lessons and evidence that indicate the power and wisdom of God for those who ask about their news and desire to know it.

When Joseph's brothers said to their father among themselves, ""Joseph and his full brother are dearer to our father than we are, so he prefers them over us, and we are a group of many. Indeed, our father is in clear error, since he preferred them over us without any justification that we see.""

Kill Joseph or throw him into an unknown land far from civilization, so that your father's love and affection for you will be sincere, and he will not turn away from you to anyone else, and you will be, after the killing of Joseph or his banishment, repentant to God, seeking forgiveness for Him after your sin.

A speaker from among Joseph's brothers said, ""Do not kill Joseph, but throw him into the well, so that some of the travelers who pass by will pick him up, and you will be relieved of him, and there is no need to kill him if you are determined to do what you say."""
m-0480	"Joseph's brothers said after they agreed to send him away, ""O our father, why do you not make us trustees over Joseph, even though he is our brother and we want the best for him and we feel sorry for him and take care of him and give him sincere advice? Send him with us tomorrow when we go out to our pastures so that he can run and be active and happy and play racing and other permissible games, and we will protect him from everything you fear for him."" Jacob said, ""Indeed, it pains me that he will be separated from me when you take him to the pastures, and I fear that a wolf will eat him while you are heedless and busy with him."" Joseph's brothers said to their father, ""If the wolf eats him while we are a strong group, then we will surely be losers. There is no good in us nor any benefit to be expected from us."" So he sent him with them. When they went with him and agreed to throw him into the bottom of the well, We inspired Joseph, ""You will surely inform your brothers in the future of this deed that they did to you, and they did not sense or feel it."""
m-0481	"And Joseph's brothers came to their father at the time of the evening meal, early in the night, crying and showing sorrow and grief. They said, ""O our father, indeed we went racing in running and shooting arrows and left Joseph with our provisions and clothes. We did not fail in protecting him, but we left him in our safety. We did not part from him except for a short time, and the wolf ate him. And you would not believe us, even if we were described as truthful, because of your intense love for Joseph."" They brought his shirt stained with blood other than Joseph's blood to testify to their truthfulness, and it was evidence of their lie, because the shirt was not torn. Then their father Jacob, peace be upon him, said to them, ""The matter is not as you say. Rather, your souls, which command evil, have made an ugly thing attractive to you in Joseph. You saw it as good and did it. So my patience is a beautiful patience, with which I have no complaint to anyone among creation. I seek help from God to bear what you describe as falsehood, not from my strength and power."""
m-0482	"A group of travelers came and sent someone to ask them for water. When he lowered his bucket into the well, Joseph clung to it. The one who brought it said, ""Good news! This is a valuable boy."" The one who brought it and his companions hid Joseph from the rest of the travelers and did not reveal him to them. They said, ""This is merchandise that we have bought. And God knows what they do with Joseph."" His brothers sold him to the other travelers for a small price of dirhams. They were indifferent to him and wanted to get rid of him because they did not know his status with God. When the travelers went with Joseph to Egypt, its chief, the minister, bought him from them and said to his wife, ""Treat him well and make his position with us honorable, so that we may benefit from his service or establish him with us in the position of a son. Just as We saved Joseph and made the chief of Egypt kind to him, so We established him in the land of Egypt and made him overseer of its treasuries. And that We might teach him the interpretation of dreams so that he might know from them what will happen in the future. And God is predominant over His affair, so His judgment is effective and no one can nullify it. But most people do not know that the whole matter is in God's hand."" When Joseph reached The height of his strength was in his youth. We gave him understanding and knowledge. And such is the reward with which We rewarded Joseph for his good deeds. We reward the doers of good for their good deeds. And in this is consolation for the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace."
m-0483	"The wife of Al-Aziz gently and kindly invited Joseph, who was in her house, to herself, because of her intense love for him and his beautiful appearance. She closed the doors on her and Joseph and said, “Come to me.” He said, “God forbid! I seek refuge in Him and seek protection from the one you are calling me to, from the betrayal of my master who has made my status good and honored me. I will not betray him in his family. Indeed, he who wrongs and does what he has no right to do will not succeed.” Her soul was inclined to commit an immoral act, and Joseph spoke to himself in thoughts about the response, had he not seen a sign from the signs of his Lord that would deter him from what his soul had told him. We only showed him that to repel evil and immorality in all his affairs. Indeed, he is one of Our purified servants chosen for the message, who were sincere in their worship of God and His Oneness. Joseph hurried to the door, wanting to go out, and she hurried to try to catch him, and she pulled his shirt from behind him to prevent him from going out, so she tore it apart. They found her husband at the door, and she said, “What is the penalty for one who intended an immoral act with your wife except that he be imprisoned or punished with a painful punishment?” Joseph said, “She is the one who asked me to do that.” A baby in the cradle from among her family bore witness. And he said, ""If his shirt is torn in the front, then she is telling the truth in her accusation against him, and he is one of the liars. But if his shirt is torn in the back, then she is lying in her statement, and he is one of the truthful."" When the husband saw that Joseph's shirt was torn in the back, he knew Joseph was innocent and said to his wife, ""This lie with which you have accused this young man is part of your deception, O women. Indeed, your deception is great."" The Aziz of Egypt said, ""O Joseph, leave off mentioning what happened from her and do not mention it to anyone, and ask, O woman, forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were among the sinners in your temptation of Joseph and in your slander against him."""
m-0484	The news reached the women of the city, so they talked about it and said something reprehensible about the wife of Al-Aziz. The wife of Al-Aziz was trying to get her slave away from her and inviting him to herself, while her love for him had reached the core of her heart, which was its covering. Indeed, we see that she is clearly in error in this action. When the wife of Al-Aziz heard of their backbiting of her and their trickery in slandering her, she sent to them inviting them to visit her. She prepared for them pillows to lean on and food to eat, and gave each one of them a knife to cut the food. Then she said to Joseph, “Come out to them.” When they saw him, they admired him and revered him, and his beauty and handsomeness took them by surprise and amazement, so they cut their hands while cutting the food, and they said in astonishment, “God forbid! This is not of the human race, for his beauty is not known in humans. He is nothing but a noble angel.” The wife of Al-Aziz said to the women who had cut their hands, “This is the young man whom you blamed me for being infatuated with. I asked for him and tried to entice him to respond.” If he refuses and does not do what I order him to do in the future, he will be punished by going to prison and will be among the humiliated.
m-0485	Joseph said, seeking refuge from their evil and their plotting, “O my Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me, which is to commit immorality. And if You do not avert from me their plotting, I will turn toward them and be among the foolish who commit sin because of their ignorance.” So God answered Joseph’s prayer and averted from him what the wife of Al-Aziz and her companions wanted from him, which was to disobey God. Indeed, God is the Hearer of Joseph’s prayer and the prayer of every supplicant among His creation, the Knower of his request and his need and what is good for him and the need of all His creation and what is good for them. Then it became clear to Al-Aziz and his companions, after they saw the evidence of Joseph’s innocence and chastity, that they should imprison him for a long or short period of time, to prevent disgrace.
m-0486	"And two young men entered prison with Joseph. One of them said, ""I saw in a dream that I was pressing grapes to make wine."" The other said, ""I saw that I was carrying bread on my head from which birds were eating. Tell us, O Joseph, the interpretation of what you saw. We see that you are among those who do good in their worship of God and in their treatment of His creation."" Joseph said to them, ""No food that you are provided with will come to you under any circumstances except that I will tell you its interpretation before it comes to you. That is the interpretation that I will interpret for you from what my Lord has taught me. I have believed in Him and have devoted worship to Him, and have turned away from the religion of a people who do not believe in God and who deny the Resurrection and the Judgment. I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I have worshipped God alone. It was not for us to make a partner for God in His worship. That is the monotheism of singling out God for worship, which God has favored us and the people with. But most people do not thank God for the blessing of monotheism and faith."" Joseph said to the two young men who were with him in prison, ""Is the worship of various created gods better or the worship of God, the One, the Prevailing?"" What you worship besides God are nothing but names with no meanings behind them that you have made. You and your fathers are lords, out of ignorance and misguidance. Allah has not sent down any proof or evidence for its validity. The true judgment is only for Allah, the Most High, who has no partner. He commanded that you not be led or submissive to anyone other than Him, and that you worship Him alone. This is the upright religion in which there is no crookedness, but most people are ignorant of that and do not know its truth. O my two companions in prison, here is the interpretation of your vision. As for the one who saw that he was pressing grapes in his vision, he will be released from prison and will be a wine cupbearer for the king. As for the other who saw that he was carrying bread on his head, he will be crucified and left, and birds will eat from his head. The matter about which you were asking was decided and completed. And Joseph said to the one he knew would be saved from his two companions, “Mention me to your master the king and tell him that I am wronged and imprisoned without guilt.” But Satan forgot that man to mention Joseph’s situation to the king, so Joseph remained in prison for several years after that."
m-0487	"The king said, ""Indeed, I saw in my dream seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean cows. I saw seven green ears of corn and seven dry ears of corn. O lords and nobles, tell me about this dream if you can interpret dreams."" They said, ""This dream of yours is a mixture of dreams that have no interpretation, and we are not experts in interpreting dreams."" The one who escaped from being killed among my companions in prison, who remembered after a while what he had forgotten about Joseph, said, ""I will tell you the interpretation of this dream. So send me to Joseph so that I may bring you its interpretation."" When the man reached Joseph, Joseph said to him, ""O friend, interpret for us the dream of one who saw seven fat cows being eaten by seven lean cows. He saw seven green ears of corn and seven dry ears of corn, so that I may return to the king and his companions and inform them so that they may know the interpretation of what I asked you about and so that they may know your status and virtue."" Joseph said to his questioner about the king's dream, ""The interpretation of this dream is that you will plant for seven consecutive years, diligently, so that the bounty may increase, but what you have harvested is not what you have harvested."" From it every time, store it and leave it in its ear so that it may be preserved from decay and so that it may last except a little of what you eat of grains. Then after these fertile years there will come seven years of severe drought in which the people will eat everything you had stored for them before except a little of what you save and store to be seeds for planting. Then after these years of drought there will come a year in which the people will be relieved by rain, so God Almighty will lift the hardship from them and they will press the fruits in it from the abundance of fertility and growth."
m-0488	"The king said to his men, ""Bring the man who interprets dreams out of prison and bring him to me."" When the king's messenger came to him, calling for him, Joseph said to the messenger, ""Go back to your master the king and ask him to ask the women who wounded their hands about the truth of their matter and their affair with me, so that the truth may be revealed to everyone and my innocence may be made clear. My Lord knows what they do and what they do. Nothing of that is hidden from Him."" The king said to the women who wounded their hands, ""What was your affair when you tried to seduce Joseph on the day of hospitality? Did you see anything suspicious from him?"" They said, ""God forbid! We did not know of anything that would disgrace him."" Then the wife of Al-Aziz said, ""Now the truth has appeared after it had been hidden. I am the one who tried to tempt him by seducing him, but he refused. Indeed, he is among the truthful in all that he said."" That statement which I said in exonerating him and admitting to myself, so that my husband may know that I did not betray him by lying to him, nor did I commit an immoral act, and that I tried to seduce him and admitted that to show my innocence and his, and that God does not guide the treacherous nor guide them in their treachery. The wife of Al-Aziz said, ""And what I purify myself and do not declare it innocent. Indeed, the soul often commands its owner to commit sins in pursuit of its pleasures, except for those whom Allah protects. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of the sins of those of His servants who repent, Merciful to them.

The king, the ruler of Egypt, said when he heard of Joseph’s innocence, “Bring him to me, I will make him one of my confidants and advisors.” So when Joseph came and the king spoke to him and recognized his innocence, his great trustworthiness, and his good character, he said to him, “Today you are of great status with us and are entrusted with everything.”

And Joseph wanted to benefit the servants and establish justice among them, so he said to the king, “Make me governor of the treasuries of Egypt, for I am a trustworthy treasurer with knowledge and insight into what I am in charge of.”

And just as Allah bestowed His release upon Joseph, He enabled him in the land of Egypt, to descend from it to any abode he wished. Allah afflicts with His mercy whomever He wills of His righteous servants, and He does not waste the reward of anyone who does good deeds.

And the reward of the Hereafter with Allah is greater than the reward of this world for the people of faith and piety who fear Allah’s punishment and obey Him in His commands and prohibitions."
m-0489	"Joseph's brothers came to Egypt after drought struck their land to bring food from there. They entered upon him and he recognized them, but they did not recognize him due to the long period and the change in his appearance. Joseph ordered that they be honored and that they be well-attended. Then he gave them the food they asked for. They had told him that they had a brother from their father whom they had not brought with them. They wanted his brother. He said, ""Bring me your brother from your father. Have you not seen that I have given you full measure and honored you in hospitality? I am the best of hosts to you. If you do not bring him to me, then you will have no food with me to feed you, and do not come to me."" They said, ""We will do our best to convince his father to send him with us, and we will not fall short in that."" Joseph said to his servants, ""Put the price of what they took in their belongings secretly, hoping that they will recognize it when they return to their families and appreciate our honoring them, so that they may return, hoping for our gift."""
m-0490	"When they returned to their father, they told him how the Aziz had honored them and said, ""He will not give us anything in the future unless our brother, whom we told him about, is with us. Send him with us and we will bring you food and we will promise to protect him."" Their father said to them, ""How can I trust you with Benjamin when I have previously trusted you with his brother Joseph and you promised to protect him but you did not fulfill that? I do not trust your promise and your protection, but I trust in the protection of Allah, the best of protectors and the most merciful of the merciful. I hope that He will have mercy on me and protect him and return him to me."" When they opened their containers, they found that the price of their merchandise that they had paid had been returned to them. They said, ""O our father, what more can we ask for than this? This is the price of our merchandise that the Aziz has returned to us. So be reassured about our brother and send him with us so that we may bring abundant food for our family and protect our brother and increase his camel load, for the Aziz measures out a camel load for each one of them, and that is an easy measure for him."" Jacob said to them, ""I will not let him go with you until you promise and swear to me by Allah that you will return him to me unless you overpower him and are unable to free him."" So when they gave him God's covenant with what he asked for. Jacob said: God is a witness over what we say, meaning that His testimony and His protection of us are sufficient for us."
m-0491	"And their father said to them, ""O my sons, when you enter the land of Egypt, do not enter through one gate, but enter it through separate gates so that the evil eye will not strike you. And when I command you this, I do not prevent from you anything that God has decreed against you. For judgment belongs to God alone. Upon Him I have relied and trusted, and upon Him alone do the believers rely."" And when they entered through separate gates as their father had commanded them, this was not to prevent God's decree from them, but it was out of compassion in Jacob's soul for them lest the evil eye strike them. And Jacob was a man of great knowledge of the matter of his religion, which God had taught him by revelation, but most people do not know the consequences of matters and the details of things. And what Jacob, peace be upon him, knew of the matter of his religion."
m-0492	"When Joseph's brothers entered his guest house with his brother, Joseph took his brother to him and said to him secretly, ""I am your brother, so do not be sad or grieved for what they did to me in the past."" He ordered him to conceal that from them. When Joseph had prepared them and loaded their camels with food, he ordered his workers to put the vessel with which people were measured into his brother Benjamin's belongings, without anyone noticing. When they mounted to set out, a crier called out, ""O owners of this caravan laden with food, you are indeed thieves."" The sons of Jacob, approaching the crier, said, ""What are you missing?"" The crier and those present said, ""We are missing the measure with which the king measures, and the reward for whoever brings it is a camel's load of food."" The crier said, ""And I am a guarantor and a guarantor for a camel's load of food."" Joseph's brothers said, ""By God, you have ascertained from what you have seen of us that we did not come to the land of Egypt in order to cause corruption there, and it is not among our characteristics to be thieves."" Those charged with searching for the measure said to Joseph's brothers, ""What is the punishment for a thief according to you, if you are lying?"" Your saying, ""We are not thieves."" Joseph's brothers said, ""The punishment of a thief is that whoever finds the stolen item in his baggage, it is his punishment, meaning he hands over his theft to the one from whom he stole, so that he becomes a slave with him. This is the punishment, which is enslavement. We punish the wrongdoers with theft, and this is our religion and our way with those who steal."" They returned with Joseph's brothers to him, so he himself searched their belongings. He began with their belongings before his brother's belongings, perfecting what he had planned to keep his brother with him. Then he ended with his brother's vessel, and he extracted the vessel from it. Thus, We made easy for Joseph this arrangement by which he arrived at capturing his brother. He could not have captured his brother under the rule of the king of Egypt, because it is not in his religion for a thief to own, except that the will of God required this arrangement and resorting to the law of Joseph's brothers, which ruled that the thief should be free. We raise the status of whomever We will in this world above others, just as We raised the status of Joseph. And above every possessor of knowledge is one more knowledgeable than him, until knowledge ends with God, the Knower of the unseen and the seen."
m-0493	"Joseph's brothers said, ""If this one has stolen, a full brother of his has stolen before."" They meant Joseph, peace be upon him. Joseph concealed what he had heard and said to himself, ""You are worse in status than those you have mentioned, since you have plotted against me what you have done. And God knows best what you describe of lies and slander."" They said, seeking mercy so that they might fulfill their father's covenant, ""O noble one, indeed he has an old father who loves him and cannot bear to be away from him. So take one of us instead of Benjamin. Indeed, we see that you are among the doers of good in your treatment of us and others."" Joseph said, ""We seek refuge in God and seek His protection from taking anyone other than the one with whom we found the measure, as you have judged. For if we do what you ask, we will be among the wrongdoers."""
m-0494	When they despaired of his answer to what they asked for, they separated themselves from the people and began to consult among themselves. The eldest of them in age said, “Did you not know that your father took a firm covenant from you to return your brother unless you were defeated? And before this was your shortcomings with regard to Joseph and your treachery towards him. Therefore I will not leave the land of Egypt until my father gives me permission to leave it or my Lord decrees for me to leave it and I am able to take my brother. And God is the best judge and the most just of those who decide between people.”
m-0495	"Go back to your father and tell him what happened and say to him, ""Your son Benjamin has stolen, and we did not testify to that until we were certain. We saw the measure in his saddlebag, and we had no knowledge of the unseen that he would steal when we promised you to return it. Ask, O our father, the people of Egypt and those who were with us in the caravan that we were in, and we are truthful in what we have told you."" And when they returned and told their father, he said to them, ""Rather, your souls, which command evil, have made attractive to you a plot which you have devised, as you did before with Joseph. So my patience is a beautiful patience, with no impatience or complaint. Perhaps God will return to me my three sons, Joseph, his brother, and their elder brother who stayed behind for his brother's sake. He is the Knower of my condition, the Wise in His planning."" And Jacob turned away from them, and his chest was constricted by what they said, and he said, ""Oh, how I regret Joseph!"" His eyes turned white with the loss of their blackness from the intensity of his grief, for his heart was filled with grief, but he was very secretive about it. His sons said, ""By God, you will not cease to remember Joseph and your grief over him will intensify until you are about to die."" Perdition or actually perish, so ease your burden. Jacob said, answering them, “I do not reveal my worry and grief except to God alone, for He is the Remover of distress and affliction, and I know of God’s mercy and relief what you do not know.” Jacob said, “O my sons, return to Egypt and investigate the news of Joseph and his brother, and do not cut off your hope in God’s mercy. Indeed, no one cuts off hope in God’s mercy except those who deny His power and disbelieve in Him.”"
m-0496	"So they went to Egypt, and when they entered upon Joseph, they said, ""O noble one, famine and drought have afflicted us and our family, and we have come to you with a poor and small price, so give us in return what you used to give us before at a good price, and be charitable to us by taking these dirhams and spending them in charity. Indeed, Allah rewards those who are generous to those in need with their money."" When he heard their words, he felt sorry for them and introduced himself to them and said, ""Do you remember what you did to Joseph and his brother of harm while you were ignorant of the consequences of what you were doing?"" They said, ""Are you really Joseph?"" He said, ""Yes, I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has favored us and brought us together after our separation. Indeed, whoever fears Allah and is patient in the face of trials, Allah does not take away the reward of his goodness, but rather rewards him with the best reward."" They said, ""By Allah, Allah has favored you over us and honored you with knowledge, forbearance, and grace, although we were indeed sinners in what we did intentionally to you and your brother."" Joseph said to them, ""Do not blame you today. Allah will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful to whoever repents from his sin and turns to His obedience."""
m-0497	When he asked them about his father, they told him that he had lost his sight from crying over him. He said to them, “Go back to your father, and take this shirt of mine with you, and throw it over my father’s face so that his sight may return. Then bring all your family to me.” When the caravan left the land of Egypt with the shirt, Jacob said to those who were present, “I smell the scent of Joseph, unless you mock me and ridicule me and claim that I said this without realizing it.” Those present with him said, “By God, you are still in your old error of loving Joseph and you do not forget him.” When someone came to give Jacob the good news that Joseph was alive and threw Joseph’s shirt over his face, Jacob regained his sight and was filled with joy. He said to those who were with him, “Did I not tell you that I know from God what you do not know of God’s grace, mercy, and generosity?”
m-0498	"His sons said, ""O our father, ask your Lord to pardon us and cover our sins for us. Indeed, we were wrong in what we did to Joseph and his brother."" Jacob said, ""I will ask my Lord to forgive you your sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiver of the sins of His repentant servants, the Most Merciful to them."" Jacob and his family went out to Egypt intending to go after Joseph. When they reached him, Joseph took his parents to him and said to them, ""Enter Egypt by the will of God, and you will be safe from hardship and famine and from every evil."" He seated his father and mother on his royal throne beside him, honoring them. His parents and eleven brothers greeted him by prostrating to him as a greeting and honor, not as worship and submission. This was permissible in their law, but it is forbidden in our law, in order to block the means of associating partners with God. Joseph said to his father, ""This prostration is the interpretation of my dream that I told you before when I was young. My Lord has made it true. He has been kind to me when He brought me out of prison and brought you to me from the desert after Satan had corrupted the bond of brotherhood between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord Gentle in disposing of what He wills. He is the All-Knowing of what is in the best interests of His servants, the Wise in His words and deeds. Then Joseph called upon his Lord, saying, “My Lord, You have given me of the kingdom of Egypt and taught me of the interpretation of dreams and other knowledge. O Creator of the heavens and the earth and their Originator, You are the One in charge of all my affairs in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with Your righteous servants, the pious prophets and the chosen and good ones.”"
m-0499	"What is mentioned in the story of Joseph is from the news of the unseen. We inform you, O Messenger, by revelation. You were not present with Joseph’s brothers when they plotted to throw him into the well and deceived him and his father. This indicates your truthfulness and that God is revealing to you.

And most of the polytheists among your people, O Messenger, do not believe you or follow you, even if you were keen on their belief. So do not grieve over that.

And do not ask your people for a reward for guiding them to faith. Indeed, what you were sent with of the Qur’an and guidance is a lesson for all people, so that they may remember and be guided.

And many of the signs indicating the Oneness of God and His power are spread throughout the heavens and the earth, such as the sun, the moon, the mountains, and the trees. They see them, but they turn away from them, not thinking about them or considering them.

And these people who turn away from the signs of God do not acknowledge that God is their Creator and Provider and the Creator of everything and is worthy of worship alone, except that they are polytheists in their worship of idols and statues. God is far above that.

Do they have what makes them feel safe from a punishment from God descending upon them that encompasses them or that the Resurrection comes to them suddenly? They do not feel or sense that"
m-0500	"Say to them, O Messenger, this is my way. I call to the worship of Allah alone, based on a proof from Allah and certainty, I and those who follow my example. I declare Allah, the Most High, to be free from partners, and I am not one of those who associate others with Allah. We did not send before you, O Messenger, to the people except men from among themselves. We sent down to them Our revelation, and they are from the people of the city, so they are more capable of understanding the call and the message. Those who are guided to the truth believe them, and those who have gone astray from it deny them. Have they not walked through the earth and witnessed how was the end of the previous deniers and what befell them of destruction? And the reward of the Hereafter is better than this world and what is in it for those who believe and fear their Lord. So will you not reflect and take heed? And do not hasten, O Messenger, victory over those who deny you, for victory did not come to the messengers before you immediately, for a reason that We know. Until, when the messengers despaired of their people and were certain that their people had denied them and there was no hope in their belief, Our victory came to them at the time of great distress. Then We save whom We will of the messengers and their followers, and Our punishment is not averted from those who commit crimes and are bold. On God and in this is consolation for the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace

Indeed, in the news of the messengers which We have related to you and what happened to the deniers is a lesson for people of sound minds. This Qur’an is not a false or fabricated story, but We have sent it down confirming what came before it of the heavenly books and explaining everything that the servants need of what is permissible and forbidden, what is beloved and what is hated, and other than that, and as guidance from misguidance and mercy for the people of faith, so that their hearts are guided by it and they act according to what is in it of commands and prohibitions."
m-0501	"The speech on the disconnected letters was previously mentioned at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah.

Allah is the One Who raised the seven heavens by His power without pillars as you see them, then He rose up, that is, He ascended and ascended above the Throne in a manner befitting His Majesty and Greatness, and He subjected the sun and the moon for the benefit of the servants, each of them revolving in its orbit until the Day of Resurrection. He, glory be to Him, manages the affairs of this world and the Hereafter. He explains to you the verses indicating His power and that there is no god but Him, so that you may be certain of Allah and the return to Him. So believe in His promise and His threat and devote worship to Him alone.

And He, glory be to Him, is the One Who made the earth expansive and extended, and prepared it for your livelihood, and placed mountains in it to stabilize it, and rivers for your drink and for your benefits, and made in it of every kind of fruit two kinds, so that among them were white and black, and sweet and sour, and He made the night to cover the day with its darkness. Indeed in all of that are lessons for a people who reflect on them and take heed.

And on the earth are tracts, some of them adjacent to others, some of them are good, growing that which benefits people, and some of them are salty marshes that grow nothing. And on the good earth are gardens of grapes, and He placed therein Different crops and palm trees gathered together in one place and not gathered together in one soil and drinking from one water, but they differ in fruits, size, taste and other things. This one is sweet and this one is sour, and some of them are better to eat than others. Indeed in that are signs for whoever has a heart that understands the commands and prohibitions of God Almighty."
m-0502	And if you are amazed, O Messenger, by their disbelief after this evidence, then what is even more astonishing is the saying of the disbelievers: “When we die and become dust, will we be resurrected again?” Those are the ones who deny their Lord who created them from nothingness. And those will have chains of fire around their necks on the Day of Resurrection. And those will enter the Fire and never come out of it. And the deniers are hastening you with the punishment that I did not hasten to them with before the faith by which security and good deeds are hoped for. And the punishments of the deniers before them have passed, so how can they not take heed from them? And your Lord, O Messenger, is the possessor of forgiveness for the sins of whoever repents from his sins among the people for their wrongdoing. He opens for them the door of forgiveness and calls them to it, while they wrong themselves by disobeying their Lord. And your Lord is severe in punishment for whoever persists in disbelief, misguidance, and disobedience to Allah. And the disbelievers of Mecca say: “Why did not a tangible miracle come to him like the staff of Moses and the she-camel of Salih?” But that is not in your hand, O Messenger. You are only a conveyor to them and a frightener of the wrath of Allah. And for every nation there is a messenger who guides them to Allah the Most High.
m-0503	Allah knows what every female carries in her womb, whether male or female, and whether he is wretched or happy. He knows what the wombs lack, such as a miscarriage or a birth before nine months, and what is more than that. Everything is predestined by Allah according to a measure of deficiency or excess that He does not exceed. Allah knows what is hidden from sight and what is seen. He is the Great in His Essence, Names and Attributes. He is Exalted over all His creation by His Essence, Power and Power. He is equal in His knowledge, the Exalted, to those among you who conceal their speech and the one who speaks it aloud. He is equal to those who conceal their deeds in the darkness of the night and the one who speaks it aloud in broad daylight. Allah has angels who take turns with a person, before him and behind him, protecting him by Allah’s command and counting what comes from him of good or evil. Allah, the Exalted, does not change a blessing that He has bestowed upon a people unless they change what He has commanded them to do and disobey Him. If Allah wills a calamity for a group, there is no escape from it. They have no guardian besides Allah to take care of their affairs, bring them what is beloved and ward off what is disliked from them.
m-0504	It is He who shows you of His signs - the lightning, which is the shining light through the clouds - so you fear that the burning thunderbolts will descend upon you from it, and you hope that rain will descend with it. And by His power, glory be to Him, He creates the clouds laden with abundant water for your benefit. And the thunder glorifies God with praise, a glorification that indicates its submission to its Lord, and the angels are pure of their fear of God. And God sends the destructive thunderbolts, destroying with them whomever He wills of His creation, and the disbelievers dispute about the Oneness of God and His ability to resurrect, and He is severe in power and strength and in punishment of whoever disobeys Him.
m-0505	To Allah alone is the call to monotheism. There is no god but Allah, so none is to be worshipped or invoked except Him. The gods that they worship besides Allah do not answer the call of the one who calls upon them. Their condition with them is like that of a thirsty person who stretches his hand to water from afar to reach his mouth but does not reach it. The question of the disbelievers of them is nothing but the utmost deviation from the truth because they associate others with Allah. To Allah alone prostrates in submission and obedience, all that is in the heavens and the earth, so the believers prostrate and submit to Him willingly and by choice, and the disbelievers submit to Him against their will because they are too arrogant to worship Him, and their condition and nature belie them in that, and the shadows of the creatures submit to His greatness, so they move by His will at the beginning and end of the day. Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists: Who is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and their Manager? Say, “Allah is the Creator and Manager of them.” And you acknowledge that. Then say to them, obliging them with proof: Have you made other than Him your deities while they are not able to benefit or harm themselves, let alone benefit or harm you? And you have abandoned the worship of their Owner. Say to them, O Messenger: Is the unbeliever equal to you, who is like the blind, and the believer, who is like the seeing, or is the unbelief equal to you, who is like darkness, and the faith, which is like light, or is their allies, whom they made partners with God, creating the like of His creation, so that the creation of the partners became similar to God’s creation, and they believed that they deserved to be worshipped? Say to them, O Messenger, God Almighty is the Creator of every being from nothing, and He alone is worthy of worship, and He is the One, the Subduer, who deserves divinity and worship, not idols and statues that do not harm or benefit. Then God, the Exalted, gave an example of truth and falsehood with water that He sent down from the sky, and with it the valleys of the earth flowed, according to their smallness and largeness, so the flood carried scum floating above it, of no benefit. He gave another example, which is the metals that they light fires on to melt them, seeking adornment, as in the case of gold and silver, or seeking benefits from which they benefit, as in the case of copper, so that their impurity comes out of them, which is of no benefit, like that which was with the water. With this, God gives an example of truth and falsehood, so falsehood is like the scum of water, it disappears or is thrown away, since it is of no benefit, and truth is like water. Pure and clean minerals remain in the earth for use, as He has shown you. These examples are also used by people to distinguish truth from falsehood and guidance from misguidance.
m-0506	"For the believers who obeyed Allah and His Messenger is Paradise. And for those who disobeyed and disbelieved in him is the Fire. And if they owned all that is on the earth and double it, they would offer it as ransom for themselves from the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection, and it will not be accepted from them. Those will be held accountable for all the evil deeds they did before. And their dwelling and their abode will be Hell; it will be for them a bed, and an evil bed is that which they have prepared for themselves. Is he who knows that what has come to you, O Messenger, from Allah is the truth and believes in it like the blind to the truth who has not believed? Only those who are of sound minds will take heed, who fulfill the covenant of Allah which He has commanded them to make and do not break the covenant which they have made with Allah? Is he who knows that what has come to you, O Messenger, from Allah is the truth and believes in it like the blind to the truth who has not believed? Only those who are of sound minds will take heed, who fulfill the covenant of Allah which He has commanded them to make and do not break the covenant which they have made with Allah? They are the ones who maintain what Allah has commanded them to maintain, such as relatives and the needy, and they are mindful of their Lord and fear that He will hold them accountable for all their sins. And nothing of it will be forgiven for them.

They are those who are patient in the face of harm, in obedience and in avoiding disobedience, seeking the pleasure of their Lord, and perform the prayer in the most perfect manner, and pay from their wealth their obligatory zakat and recommended expenditures in secret and in public, and repel evil with good, so it erases it. Those described with these qualities will have the praiseworthy outcome in the Hereafter.

That outcome is the Gardens of Eden, in which they will reside and will never leave, and with them will be righteous fathers, wives, and offspring, males and females. The angels will enter upon them from every gate to congratulate them on entering Paradise.

The angels will say to them, “You have been saved from all evil because of your patience in obeying Allah. What an excellent outcome for the home is Paradise.”"
m-0507	As for the wretched, they have been described with the opposite qualities of the believers. They are those who do not fulfill the covenant of Allah to single Him out for worship after they have emphasized it upon themselves. They are those who sever what Allah has commanded them to maintain, such as maintaining family ties and other things, and they spread corruption on earth by committing sins. Those who are described with these ugly qualities will be expelled from the mercy of Allah and will suffer severe punishment in the Hereafter. Allah alone expands provision for whomever He wills of His servants and restricts it for whomever He wills of them. The disbelievers rejoice in the abundance of this worldly life, and this worldly life, in comparison to the Hereafter, is nothing but a small thing that is enjoyed and quickly disappears. The disbelievers say out of stubbornness, “Why was a tangible miracle not sent down to Muhammad like the miracles of Moses and Jesus?” Tell them that Allah misguides whomever He wills of the obstinate ones from guidance, and miracles do not benefit Him. He guides to His true religion whoever returns to Him and seeks His pleasure.
m-0508	And He guides those whose hearts are reassured by the oneness of God and His remembrance, and are reassured. It is only through the obedience of God, His remembrance, and His reward that hearts are reassured and find comfort. Those who believed in God and His Messenger and did righteous deeds - for them is joy, delight in the eyes, a good state, and a good return to the Paradise of God and His pleasure.
m-0509	Just as We sent the messengers before you, We sent you, O Messenger, to a nation before which nations of messengers had passed away, so that you might recite to this nation the Qur’an revealed to you, and the state of your people was denial of the Oneness of the Most Gracious. Say to them, O Messenger, “The Most Gracious, whom you have not taken as a single god, is my Lord alone, there is no true deity other than Him. Upon Him I have relied and trusted, and to Him is my return and my turning.” Allah, the Most High, responds to the disbelievers who asked for tangible miracles to be sent down to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and says to them, “If there were a Qur’an that could be recited, by which mountains would move from their places, or the earth would split open into rivers, or the dead would come to life, and it would speak, as they asked of you, then this Qur’an would be the one characterized by that, and no other, and they would not have believed in it. Rather, Allah alone is the authority over miracles and other things. Do the believers not know that if Allah willed, all the people of the earth would believe without a miracle? And the disbelievers continue to be afflicted with a calamity because of their disbelief, such as killing and captivity in the battles of the Muslims, or that calamity would befall them near their home until Allah’s promise of victory over them comes. Indeed, Allah does not fail to fulfill His promise.” The deadline, and if they have mocked your call, O Messenger, then the nations of you have mocked them with their messengers, so do not be saddened by those who disbelieved and then took them with my punishment and it was a severe punishment. The Buroun of God with partners in his land that he does not know or calls them partners with an apparent word without having a truth but rather the devil of the infidels.
m-0510	The description of Paradise that God has promised to those who fear Him is that rivers flow beneath its trees and palaces, its fruit never ceases, and its shade never fades or diminishes. That is the reward of Paradise, the outcome of those who fear God, so they avoid His transgressions and perform His obligations. The outcome of those who disbelieve in God is the Fire.
m-0511	And those to whom We gave the Scripture from among the Jews and Christians, those of them who believed in you, such as Abdullah bin Salam and the Negus, rejoice in the Qur’an revealed to you because it agrees with what they have. And among those who partisan in disbelief against you, such as Sayyid and Aqib, the bishops of Najran, and Ka’b bin al-Ashraf, who deny some of what was revealed to you, say to them, “Allah has only commanded me to worship Him alone and not to associate anything with Him. To His worship I call people, and to Him is my return and my final resort.” And just as We sent down the Scriptures to the prophets in their language, We have sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an in the language of the Arabs so that you may judge by it. And if you follow the desires of the polytheists in worshipping other than Allah after the truth that has come to you from Allah, you will have no helper to support you and protect you from His punishment.
m-0512	"And when they say, ""What is the matter with you, O Messenger, that you marry women? We have already sent before you messengers from among mankind and made for them wives and offspring."" And when they say, ""If he were a messenger, he would have brought what We asked of miracles,"" then it is not in the power of a messenger to bring a miracle that his people wanted except by the permission of Allah. For every matter that Allah has decreed, there is a book and a term that Allah has written with Him. It cannot be advanced or delayed. Allah erases whatever He wills of rulings and other things and keeps whatever He wills of them for a wisdom that He knows. And with Him is the Mother of the Book, which is the Preserved Tablet. And if We show you, O Messenger, some of the punishment with which We have threatened your enemies of disgrace and humiliation in this world, then that is what is hastened for them. And if We cause you to die before you see that, then all you have to do is convey the message, and upon Us is the reckoning and the recompense. Have these disbelievers not seen that We come upon the earth, reducing it from its borders? And that is by the conquest of the lands of the polytheists by the Muslims and their annexation to the lands of the Muslims. And Allah, glory be to Him, judges; there is no adjuster of His judgment and decree, and He is swift in reckoning, so do not hasten the punishment, for everything that is coming is near. And those before them had already planned plots against their messengers, as these have done with you. To God belongs all the plotting, so He will nullify their plotting and return it to them with disappointment and regret. He knows, glory be to Him, what every soul earns of good or evil, and will be recompensed for it. And the disbelievers will know when they come before their Lord to whom will be the good end after this world. It is for the followers of the messengers. And in this is a threat and warning to the disbelievers. And those who disbelieve say to the Prophet of God, “O Muhammad, God did not send you.” Say to them, “Sufficient is God as a witness to my truthfulness and your falsehood. And sufficient is the testimony of those who have knowledge of the Book from among the Jews and Christians who believe in my message and what I have brought from God and follow the truth.” So he declared that testimony and did not conceal it."
m-0513	"The letters have been previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

The letters have been previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah
And those who turned away and did not believe in Allah and follow His messengers are those who choose the fleeting life of this world and abandon the everlasting Hereafter and prevent people from following the religion of Allah and want it to be a crooked path that agrees with their desires. Those described with these attributes are in error from the truth, far from all causes of guidance.
And We did not send any messenger before you, O Prophet, except in the language of his people to make clear to them the law of Allah. So Allah misguides whom He wills from guidance and guides whom He wills to the truth. And He is the Exalted in Might in His kingdom, the Wise, who places matters in their proper places according to wisdom."
m-0514	And We sent Moses to the Children of Israel and supported him with miracles that indicated his truthfulness and commanded him to call them to faith to bring them out from error to guidance and to remind them of the blessings and punishments of Allah in His days. Indeed in this reminder of them are indications for every patient in obeying Allah and in avoiding His prohibitions and His decrees, grateful and fulfilling the rights of Allah, thanking Allah for His blessings and He singled them out for that because they are the ones who take heed of them and do not neglect them. And mention, O Messenger, to your people the story of Moses when he said to the Children of Israel, remember the blessing of Allah upon you when He saved you from Pharaoh and his followers who were making you taste the most severe punishment and slaughtering your male children so that no one would come from them to seize Pharaoh’s kingdom and they left the females alive in humiliation. And in that is a trial and a great test for you from your Lord. And Moses said to them, “And remember when your Lord informed you with a firm announcement that if you are grateful for His blessings, He will surely increase you from His bounty; but if you deny the blessing of Allah, He will surely punish you with a severe punishment.” And he said to them, “If you disbelieve in Allah, you and all the people of the earth.” You will not harm God at all, for God is independent of His creation, deserving of praise and commendation, and praised in every situation.
m-0515	"Has there not come to you, O nation of Muhammad, the news of the nations that preceded you - the people of Noah, the people of Hud, the people of Salih, and the nations that came after them, whose number is only known to God? Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they bit their hands in anger and disdain for accepting the faith and said to their messengers, ""Indeed, we do not believe in what you have brought us, and indeed, we are in doubt about what you call us to of faith and monotheism, which is a cause for suspicion."" Their messengers said to them, ""Is there any doubt about God and His worship alone, while He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and their originator from nothing without a previous example? And He calls you to faith so that He may forgive you your sins and delay your stay in this world until a term He has determined, which is the end of your terms, so that He will not punish you in this world."" They said to their messengers, ""We see you only as human beings, your characteristics are like our characteristics. You have no superiority over us that would qualify you to be messengers. You want to prevent us from worshipping what our fathers used to worship of idols and statues. So bring us a clear proof that testifies to the truth of what you say."" And when the messengers heard what their people said, they said to them, ""What you say is true."" We are only human beings like you, as you said, but God bestows His favors upon whomever He wills of His servants, and He chooses them for His message. And what you have asked for of clear proof, it is not possible for us and we are not able to bring it to you except with the permission and guidance of God. And upon God alone do the believers depend in all their affairs. How can we not depend on God, when He is the One who guided us to the path of salvation from His punishment by following the rulings of His religion? And we will be patient with your harming us with bad words and other things. And upon God alone must the believers depend for their victory and the defeat of their enemies."
m-0516	The hearts of the disbelievers were constricted by what the messengers had said, so they said to them, “We will expel you from our lands until you return to our religion.” So God revealed to His messengers that He would destroy the deniers who disbelieved in Him and His messengers. And that We would make the good end for the messengers and their followers by settling them in the land of the disbelievers after their destruction. That destruction of the disbelievers and settling the believers in their land is a confirmed matter for whoever fears his position before the Day of Resurrection and fears My threat and My punishment. The messengers turned to their Lord and asked Him for victory over their enemies and to judge between them, so He answered them, and every arrogant person who does not accept the truth, nor submit to it, nor acknowledge the oneness of God and the sincerity of worship to Him was destroyed. And before this disbeliever is Hell, where he will receive its torment and be given to drink from the pus and blood that comes out of the bodies of the people of Hell. The arrogant person tries to swallow the pus and blood and other things that flow from the people of Hell time after time, but he is unable to swallow them because of their filth, heat, and bitterness, and severe torment comes to him of every kind and from every part of his body, and he is not dead, so he can rest and After this torment comes another painful torment. The description of the deeds of the unbelievers in this world, such as righteousness and maintaining family ties, is like the description of ashes that the wind blows violently on a windy day, leaving no trace of them. So too are their deeds. They will not find anything of benefit to them with God, for disbelief has blown them away just as the wind blew away the ashes. That striving and working without a foundation is misguidance far from the straight path.
m-0517	Did you not know, O addressee, and what is meant is all people, that God created the heavens and the earth in the correct manner that indicates His wisdom and that He did not create them in vain, but rather to prove through them His oneness and the perfection of His power, so that they may worship Him alone and not associate anything with Him. If He wills, He can do away with you and bring another people who obey God. And your destruction and bringing another people are not impossible for God, rather it is easy and simple.
m-0518	And the creatures will come out of their graves and will all appear on the Day of Resurrection before Allah, the One, the Supreme, to judge between them. Then the followers will say to their leaders, “Indeed, we were your followers in this world, obeying your commands. So will you today defend us from the punishment of Allah at all, as you used to promise us?” The leaders will say, “If Allah had guided us to faith, we would have guided you to it, but He did not guide us, so we went astray and led you astray. Impatience and patience are equal for us and for you, for there is no escape from the punishment or a place of safety for us.” And Satan will say, after Allah has decided the matter and called to account His creation, and the people of Paradise have entered Paradise and the people of Hell have entered Hell, “Indeed, Allah promised you a true promise of resurrection and recompense, and I promised you a false promise that there would be no resurrection or recompense, but I broke my promise to you. I had no power over you to force you to follow me, nor did I have any argument, but I invited you to disbelief and misguidance, and you followed me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves, for the sin is yours. I will not help you, nor will you help me from the punishment of Allah. I disavow you making me a partner with Allah in His obedience in this world. Indeed, the wrongdoers, in their turning away from the truth and following falsehood, will have a painful and grievous punishment. And those who believed in God and His Messenger and did righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath whose trees and palaces rivers flow. They will never emerge from them, by permission of their Lord and by His power and strength. They will live therein in peace from God and His angels and the believers.
m-0519	Did you not know, O Messenger, how Allah gave an example of the word of monotheism, “There is no god but Allah,” with a great tree, which is the palm tree, its root is firmly fixed in the earth and its top is high towards the sky. It produces its fruits at all times by the permission of its Lord. Likewise, the tree of faith, its root is firm in the heart of the believer, in knowledge and belief, and its branch of righteous deeds and pleasing morals is raised to Allah and he receives His reward at all times. Allah gives examples to people so that they may remember and take heed and learn. And the example of a bad word, which is the word of disbelief, is like a bad tree in food and drink, which is the colocynth tree, uprooted from the top of the earth because its roots are close to the surface of the earth, it has no firm root or ascending branch. Likewise, the disbeliever has no firmness and no good in him, and no good deed of his is raised to Allah. Allah confirms those who believe with the firm, true word, which is the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and what he brought of the true religion. Allah confirms them with it in this worldly life and at their death with a good ending and in the grave when the two angels question them by guiding them to the correct answer. Allah misguides the wrongdoers from the right path in this world and the Hereafter, and Allah does what He wills of Success for the people of faith and failure for the people of disbelief and tyranny
m-0520	Have you not considered, O addressee, and the intended meaning is the general public, the state of the disbelievers from the infidels of Quraysh who replaced disbelief with Allah instead of thanking Him for the blessing of security in the Sacred Sanctuary and the mission of the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, among them? And they sent their followers to the abode of destruction when they caused them to be expelled to Badr, and they were killed, and their fate became the abode of ruin, which is Hell, which they will enter and suffer its heat and the ugliness of their abode? And these disbelievers made partners for Allah, whom they worshipped with Him, in order to distance people from His religion. Say to them, O Messenger, enjoy the life of this world, for it is fleeting, and your return and recourse is to the torment of Hell.
m-0521	"Say, O Messenger, to My servants who have believed, that they perform the prayer within its limits and give some of the wealth We have given them for the obligatory and recommended causes of good, making that a secret and announcing it before the Day of Resurrection comes when neither ransom nor friendship will be of any use.

Allah, the Most High, is He Who created the heavens and the earth and brought them into existence from nothing and sent down rain from the clouds, thereby reviving the earth after its death and brought forth for you from it your provisions and subjected for you the ships to sail upon the sea by His command for your benefit and subjected for you the rivers to water you and your animals and your crops and all your benefits.

Allah has subjected for you the sun and the moon, they never cease from their movement so that benefits may be achieved through them and He has subjected for you the night so that you may rest and rest and the day so that you may seek of His bounty and manage your livelihood.

And He has given you of all that you have asked for. And if you should count the favors of Allah upon you, you would not be able to count them or enumerate them or to give thanks for them because of their abundance and variety. Indeed, man is much unjust to himself and much ungrateful for the favors of his Lord."
m-0522	And remember, O Messenger, when Abraham said, calling upon his Lord after he had settled his son Ishmael and his mother Hagar in the valley of Mecca, “My Lord, make Mecca a city of security in which everyone in it is safe, and keep me and my children away from worshipping idols.” My Lord, idols have caused many people to stray from the path of truth. So whoever follows my example in monotheism is on my religion and my Sunnah, and whoever opposes me in anything less than polytheism, then indeed, You are Forgiving of the sins of the sinners, by Your grace, Most Merciful to them. You pardon whomever You will among them. Our Lord, indeed I have settled some of my descendants in a valley in which there is no crop or water, near Your sacred House. Our Lord, indeed I have done this by Your command so that they may perform the prayer within its limits. So make the hearts of some of Your creation incline toward them and yearn, and provide them in this place with various kinds of fruits so that they may thank You for Your great blessings.” So God answered his prayer. Our Lord, indeed You know everything we conceal and what we reveal, and nothing of the creatures on earth or in heaven is hidden from the knowledge of God. Abraham praised God Almighty and said, “Praise be to God who has provided me, in my old age, with my sons Ishmael and Isaac, after my prayer that Grant me from among the righteous. Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of supplication from whoever calls upon Him, and I have called upon Him, and He has not disappointed my hope. My Lord, make me persistent in performing the prayer in the most perfect manner, and make among my descendants those who maintain it. Our Lord, answer my supplication and accept my worship. Our Lord, forgive me for what has occurred from me, from which no human being is safe. And forgive my parents, and this was before it became clear to him that his father was an enemy of God. And forgive all the believers on the Day when mankind will stand for reckoning and recompense.
m-0523	"And do not think, O Messenger, that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do, such as denying you and other messengers, harming the believers, and other sins. He only delays their punishment for a severe day when their eyes will be raised and not closed from the horror of what they see. In this is consolation for the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

On the Day when the wrongdoers will rise from their graves, rushing to answer the caller, raising their heads, not seeing anything because of the horror of the situation, and their hearts are empty, with nothing in them because of the great fear and dread of the horror of what they see.

And warn, O Messenger, the people to whom I sent you of the punishment of Allah on the Day of Resurrection. At that time, those who wronged themselves by disbelief will say, “Our Lord, grant us respite for a short time, so that we may believe in You and believe in Your messengers.” It will be said to them, as a rebuke, “Did you not swear during your lifetime that you would not depart from the life of this world to the Hereafter, but you did not believe in this resurrection?”

And you settled in the dwellings of the previous disbelievers who wronged themselves, such as the people of Hud and Salih, and you knew what you saw and were informed of what We sent down upon them of destruction. And We presented to you examples in the Qur’an, but you did not take heed.

The polytheists plotted evil against the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, by killing him. But their plot is with God, and He encompasses it. Their plot has come back upon them. Their plot was not such that mountains or anything else would move because of its weakness and frailty. They did not harm God at all, but they harmed themselves."
m-0524	So do not think, O Messenger, that Allah will fail to fulfill His promise to His Messengers of victory and the destruction of their deniers. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might, and nothing is impossible for Him. He will take the most severe revenge on His enemies. Although the address is specific to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, it is directed to the entire Ummah. And Allah’s revenge on His enemies will be on the Day of Resurrection, the day when this earth will be replaced by another earth, white and pure like silver. Likewise, the heavens will be replaced by another, and the creatures will emerge from their graves alive and manifest to meet Allah, the One, the Subduer, the Unique in His greatness, names, attributes, actions, and His dominance over all things. And you will see, O Messenger, the criminals on the Day of Resurrection, bound in chains, their hands and feet bound in chains, and they will be in humiliation and disgrace. Their garments will be of tar that is very hot, and the fire will scorch their faces and burn them. Allah did this to them as a recompense for what they earned of sins in this world. Allah recompenses every person for what he did of good or evil. Indeed, Allah is swift in account. This Qur’an that We have revealed to you, O Messenger, is a message and an announcement to the people, to advise them and frighten them, and so that They should be certain that God is the one God, so they should worship Him alone, with no partner, and people of sound minds should take heed of this.
m-0525	"The disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

The disbelievers will wish when they see the disobedient believers coming out of the Fire that they were monotheists so that they could come out as they came out

O Messenger, leave the disbelievers to eat and enjoy their worldly life and let greed distract them from obeying Allah. They will know the losing consequences of their affair in this world and the Hereafter

And if they ask for the punishment to descend upon them in denial of you, O Messenger, then We do not destroy a city except that its destruction has a predetermined term. We do not destroy them until they reach it like those who came before them

No nation exceeds its term, increasing it, nor does it precede it, decreasing it

And the deniers said to Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in mockery, “O you to whom the Qur’an was revealed, indeed you are of lost mind. Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are truthful, so that you may bear witness that Allah sent you?”

And the deniers said to Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in mockery, “O you to whom the Qur’an was revealed, indeed you are of lost mind. Why do you not bring us the angels, if you are truthful, so that you may bear witness that Allah sent you?”

Allah replied, “We do not send down the angels except With the torment in which there is no respite for those who do not believe. And they were not to be granted respite when the angels descended with the punishment. Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur’an to the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and We undertake to protect it from any addition to it or subtraction from it or loss of anything from it."
m-0526	And We have sent before you, O Messenger, messengers among the groups of the ancients, and there was no messenger who came to them except that they used to ridicule him. And in this is a consolation for the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace. Just as these polytheists did to you, so did He do to the Messengers before you. Just as We introduced disbelief into the hearts of the previous nations by mocking the Messengers and denying them, so do We do that in the hearts of the polytheists of your people who committed crimes by disbelieving in God and denying His Messenger. They do not believe in the message that was sent down to you. And the way of the ancients has passed with the destruction of the disbelievers, and these are like them. Those of them who continue in disbelief and denial will perish. Just as We introduced disbelief into the hearts of the previous nations by mocking the Messengers and denying them, so do We do that in the hearts of the polytheists of your people who committed crimes by disbelieving in God and denying His Messenger. They do not believe in the message that was sent down to you. And The first ones passed by destroying the infidels, and these are like them. Those who persist in their disbelief and denial will perish. Even if We opened a door from the sky for the infidels of Mecca and they continued ascending through it until they saw the wonders of the Kingdom of God in the sky, they would not believe it, and they would say, “Our eyes have been bewitched until we saw what we did not see, and we are nothing but bewitched in our minds by Muhammad.” Even if We opened a door from the sky for the infidels of Mecca and they continued ascending through it until they saw the wonders of the Kingdom of God in the sky, they would not believe it, and they would say, “Our eyes have been bewitched until we saw what we did not see, and we are nothing but bewitched in our minds by Muhammad.”
m-0527	"And among the evidences of Our power is that We have made in the lowest heaven mansions for the planets to descend into, and this is used to indicate the roads and times, fertility and drought. And We have adorned this heaven with stars for those who look at it and contemplate and take heed. And We have protected the heaven from every stoned devil who is banished from the mercy of Allah so that he does not reach it. Except for one who steals an ear to the speech of the people of the highest assembly at some times, and a shining star overtakes him and burns him. And the devil may send to his friend some of what he has stolen before the meteor burns him. And the earth We have spread out, and We have cast mountains therein to stabilize it, and We have caused to grow in it of every kind of plant, what is measured and known, of what the servants need. And We have made for you therein that by which you live, of tillage and livestock and various kinds of earnings and other things. And We have created for you from offspring and servants and beasts that by which you benefit. Their provision is not upon you, but it is upon Allah, Lord of the worlds, as a favor and generosity from Him. And there is nothing of the benefits of the servants except that with Us are its treasures of all kinds, and We do not send it down except in a specific amount as We will and as We desire. So the treasures are in the hand of Allah. He gives to whomever He wills and withholds from whomever He wills according to His vast mercy and perfect wisdom

And We sent the winds and subjected them to fertilize the clouds and carry rain and goodness and benefit, so We sent down from the clouds water which We prepared for your drink and your land and your livestock. And you are not able to store it and store it, but We store it for you as a mercy to you and a kindness to you.

And indeed, it is We who give life to him who was dead by creating him from nothingness, and We cause death to him who was alive after his term has expired. And We are the inheritors of the earth and whoever is on it.

And We have certainly known who among you has perished since Adam and who is alive and who will come until the Day of Resurrection.

And indeed, it is your Lord who will gather them for the reckoning and the recompense. Indeed, He is Wise in His management, Knowing. Nothing is hidden from Him."
m-0528	"And We created Adam from dry clay, when he tapped on it, a sound was heard from him. This dry clay is a black clay whose color and smell change from the length of its stay. And We created the father of the jinn, who is Iblis, before the creation of Adam, from a fire of intense heat that had no smoke. And remember, O Prophet, when your Lord said to the angels, “Indeed, I am creating a human being from dry clay.” And this dry clay is a black clay whose color changes. So when I have proportioned him and completed his form and breathed the soul into him, then they fell down before him in prostration, a prostration of greeting and honor, not a prostration of worship. So the angels prostrated, all of them together, as their Lord commanded them. None of them refused, but Iblis refused to prostrate to Adam with the prostrating angels. God said to Iblis, “What is the matter with you that you do not prostrate with the angels?” Iblis said, showing his arrogance and envy, “It is not appropriate for me to prostrate to a human being.” I created it from dry clay, it was a black, changed clay

Beware that any of you turns back, and hasten to where Allah has commanded you, so that you may be in a secure place. And We revealed to Lot that your people will be completely destroyed at dawn. The people of the city of Lot came to Lot when they learned of the guests he had, and they were happy and rejoicing at his guests, so that they might seize them and commit immorality with them. Lot said to them, “These are my guests, and they are under my protection, so do not disgrace me, and fear the punishment of Allah, and do not expose yourself to them, lest you cause me to be humiliated and disgraced by harming my guests.” His people said, “Did We not forbid you from hosting anyone from among the worlds?” We want from them immorality

Lot said to them, “These are your women, my daughters, so marry them if you want to satisfy your desire.” He called them his daughters because the prophet of the nation is like a father to them. “And do not do what God has forbidden you, which is to come to men.”

The Creator swears by whomever He wills and by whatever He wills. As for the creature, it is not permissible for him to swear except by God. God Almighty swore by the life of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, to honor him. The people of Lot were in extreme heedlessness, hesitating and persisting until the thunderbolt of punishment befell them at sunrise.

So We turned their towns upside down, turning their upper parts into lower parts, and We rained down upon them stones of hardened, solid clay.

Indeed, in what befell them are lessons for those who observe and take heed. And indeed, their towns are on a firm road, seen by travelers passing by. In Our destruction there is a clear sign for the believers who act according to the law of Allah.

m-0532	The people of the city entwined with trees, the people of Shu'ayb, were wronging themselves because they disbelieved in Allah and His noble Messenger.

And the dwellings of the people of Lot and Shu'ayb are on a clear path, which people pass by on their journeys, so they may take heed.
m-0533	"The people of Wadi al-Hijr denied Salih, peace be upon him, and they were Thamud, and thus they were denying all the messengers, because whoever denies a prophet has denied all the prophets, because they were of one religion.

And We gave the people of Salih Our signs indicating the truth of what Salih brought them of the truth, and among them was the she-camel, but they did not take heed from them and were far from them, turning away.

And they used to carve out the mountains and make houses out of them, and they were safe from them falling on them or being destroyed.

So the thunderbolt of punishment seized them early in the morning, but neither the wealth and fortresses in the mountains nor the strength and prestige they were given did not ward off the punishment of Allah.

They indicate the perfection of their Creator and His power, and that He alone is worthy of worship, with no partner or associate. And the Hour will surely come, so that every soul will be compensated for what it has done. So pardon, O Messenger, the polytheists and overlook them and overlook what they do. Indeed, your Lord is the Creator of all things, the Knower of them. Nothing on earth or in heaven is beyond His power, and nothing is hidden from Him.
m-0535	And We have given you, O Prophet, the opening of the Qur’an, which is seven verses repeated in every prayer, and We have given you the great Qur’an. Do not look with your eyes and wish for the worldly pleasures that We have given to certain kinds of disbelievers, and do not grieve over their disbelief, and be humble towards the believers in Allah and His Messenger. And say, “Indeed, I am the warner who makes clear what guides people to faith in Allah, Lord of the worlds, and I warn you that the punishment will afflict you, just as Allah sent it down upon those who divided the Qur’an, believing in some of it and disbelieving in some of it, from among the Jews, Christians, and others.”

They are the ones who divided the Qur'an into sections and parts. Some of them say it is magic, some say it is divination, and some say otherwise. They distort it according to their whims to turn people away from guidance. By your Lord, we will surely hold them accountable on the Day of Resurrection and will recompense them all for dividing the Qur'an based on their fabrications, distorting it, and changing it, and other things they used to do, such as worshipping idols, committing sins, and wrongdoings.

So proclaim the call to the truth that Allah has commanded you to do and do not care about the polytheists, for Allah has cleared you of what they say.

Indeed, We have sufficed you against the mockers and jeers among the leaders of Quraysh who took a partner with Allah from idols and other things. They will soon know the consequences of their actions in this world and the Hereafter.

So turn to your Lord when your chest is constricted and glorify Him with praise, thanking Him and praising Him. And be among those who pray to Allah and worship Him, for that will suffice you in what concerns you.

And continue in worshipping your Lord throughout your life until the certainty comes to you, which is death. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, obeyed the command of his Lord and continued to worship Allah until the certainty from his Lord came to him."
m-0537	"The Hour is near and Allah has decreed your punishment, O disbelievers, so do not hasten the punishment in mockery of the Messenger’s threat to you. Allah, the Most High, is far removed from polytheism and partners. Allah sends down the angels with revelation from His command to whomever He wills of His servants, the Messengers, to frighten people from polytheism and that there is no true god except Me, so fear Me by performing My obligations and singling Me out in worship and sincerity. Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth so that the servants may prove by them the greatness of their Creator and that He alone is deserving of worship. He, the Most High, is far removed from their polytheism. He created man from despised water, but then he becomes strong and arrogant and becomes very contentious and argumentative to his Lord in denying the resurrection and other things, such as His saying: Who will give life to the bones when they have decayed? And Allah has forgotten who created him from nothing. And the livestock, from camels, cows, and sheep, Allah has created them for you, O people, and He has placed in their wool and fur warmth and other benefits in their milk and hides and riding, and some of them you eat. And for you in them is an adornment that brings joy to you when You return them to their homes in the evening and when you take them out to pasture in the morning

And these cattle carry what is heavy of your luggage to a distant country which you could not reach except with great effort from yourselves and great hardship. Indeed, your Lord is Kind and Merciful to you, as He has subjected to you what you need. So to Him be praise and thanks.

And He created for you horses, mules and donkeys so that you may ride them and that they may be a beauty for you and a beautiful sight. And He creates for you means of riding and other things that you have no knowledge of so that you may increase in faith in Him and in gratitude to Him.
And upon Allah is the explanation of the straight path for your guidance, which is Islam. And among the paths is that which is crooked and does not lead to guidance, which is everything that contradicts Islam from religions and sects. And if Allah had willed to guide you, He would have guided you all to faith."
m-0538	"It is He who sent down for you rain from the clouds and made for you water from it that you drink and brought forth for you trees with which you graze your animals and whose milk and benefit return to you.

He brings forth for you from the earth with this single water various crops and brings forth with it olives, palm trees, and grapes and brings forth with it all kinds of fruits and vegetables. Indeed in that bringing forth is a clear sign for a people who reflect and take heed.

And He has subjected to you the night for your rest and the day for your livelihood. And He has subjected to you the sun as a light and the moon as a radiance and for knowing the years and the reckoning and other benefits. And the stars in the sky are subservient to you by the command of Allah to know the times and the ripening of the fruits and crops and to be guided by them in the darkness. Indeed in that subjection are clear signs for a people who will understand from Allah His arguments and proofs.

And He has subjected to you what He created on the earth of animals and fruits and minerals and other things that differ in their colors and benefits. Indeed in that creation and the difference in colors and benefits is a lesson for a people who take heed and know that in the subjection of these things are signs of the Oneness of Allah Almighty and His being the only one to be worshipped."
m-0539	And it is He who has subjected the sea to you that you may eat of the fish you catch - tender meat - and extract from it adornments which you wear like pearls and coral. And you see the great ships cutting through the surface of the water, going and coming, and you board them to seek God’s provision through trade and profit therein, and perhaps you will be grateful to God Almighty for His great favor upon you, so do not worship other than Him.
m-0540	And He has established mountains in the earth to make it firm so that it will not tilt with you, and He has placed rivers in it for you to drink from, and He has placed roads in it for you to be guided by in reaching the places you intend to go to. And He has placed landmarks in the earth by which you may find your way during the day, just as He has placed the stars by which you may be guided at night. Do you make God, who creates all these things and others, worthy of worship like the alleged gods who do not create anything? Do you not remember the greatness of God and single Him out for worship? And if you try to enumerate the blessings of God upon you, you will not be able to enumerate them due to their multitude and variety. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Merciful to you, for He overlooks your shortcomings in giving thanks for blessings, and He does not cut them off from you due to your negligence, nor does He hasten to punish you.
m-0541	"And Allah, the Almighty, knows all your deeds, whether what you conceal in your souls or what you show to others, and He will reward you for them.

The gods that the polytheists worship do not create anything, even if it is small. They are creatures that the disbelievers made with their own hands. How can they worship them?

They are all inanimate objects with no life in them and do not feel the time when Allah will resurrect their worshippers. They are with them so that they may all be thrown into the Fire on the Day of Resurrection.

Your God, the only one worthy of worship, is Allah, the One God. Those who do not believe in the resurrection, their hearts deny His Oneness, the Almighty, because they do not fear His punishment. They are too arrogant to accept the truth and worship Allah alone.

Indeed, Allah knows what they conceal of beliefs, sayings, and actions and what they show of them, and He will reward them for that. He, the Almighty, does not love those who are arrogant about worshipping Him and submitting to Him. He will reward them for that."
m-0542	"And if these polytheists are asked about what was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, they will say falsely and falsely, “He only brought stories of the predecessors and their falsehoods.” Their end will be that they will bear their sins in full on the Day of Resurrection, nothing of which will be forgiven for them, and they will bear the sins of those who lied about them in order to distance them from Islam, without any reduction in their sins. How ugly is the sins they will bear! The disbelievers had plotted against their messengers before these polytheists and against the call to truth that they brought, so God destroyed their building from its foundation and base, and the roof fell on them from above, and destruction came to them from their place of safety, from where they did not expect or expect it to come to them from. Then on the Day of Resurrection, God will disgrace them with punishment and humiliate them with it, and say, “Where are My partners among the gods that you worshipped instead of Me?” So that they may ward off the punishment from you, and you used to fight the prophets and the believers and be hostile to them for their sake.” The divine scholars said that humiliation and punishment on this day will be upon the disbelievers in God and His messengers, whose souls the angels will seize in a state of They wronged themselves by disbelief, so they submitted to the command of Allah when they saw death and denied what they used to worship besides Allah and said, ""We were not doing any of the sins."" It will be said to them, ""You have lied; you were doing them. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of all your deeds, and He will recompense you for them."" Then on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will disgrace them with the punishment and humiliate them with it and say, ""Where are My partners among the gods whom you worshipped besides Me, so that they may avert the punishment from you? And you used to fight the prophets and the believers and show enmity towards them for their sake."" The divine scholars said that the humiliation and punishment on this day will be upon the disbelievers in Allah and His messengers, whose souls the angels seize while they were wronging themselves by disbelief.

It will be said to them, ""You have lied; you were doing them. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of all your deeds, and He will recompense you for them."" So enter the gates of Hell, never to emerge from it. What an evil abode it is for those who are too arrogant to believe in Allah and to worship Him alone and obey Him."
m-0543	"And when it is said to the believers who fear Allah, what did Allah send down to the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, they say, Allah sent down to him goodness and guidance for those who believed in Allah and His Messenger in this world and called the servants of Allah to faith and righteous deeds, a great honor of victory for them in this world and an abundance of provision, and the home of the Hereafter is better and greater than what they were given in this world, and what an excellent home for the righteous who fear Allah is the Hereafter.

Permanent gardens for them, in which they will reside, never to leave it, beneath whose trees and palaces rivers flow. They will have in it whatever their souls desire, with such a good reward. Allah rewards those who fear Him and are pious to Him, whose souls the angels take while their hearts are pure from disbelief.

m-0544	The polytheists are waiting for nothing but for the angels to come to them to take their souls while they are still in disbelief, or for the command of Allah to come with a swift punishment that will destroy them, just as these people lied, just as the disbelievers before them lied, so Allah destroyed them. Allah did not wrong them by destroying them and sending down punishment upon them, but they were the ones who wronged themselves by making them worthy of punishment. So the punishment for the sins they committed came upon them, and the punishment that they used to mock surrounded them.
m-0545	"The polytheists said, “If Allah had willed that we worship Him alone, we would not have worshipped anyone other than Him, neither we nor our fathers before us, nor would we have forbidden anything that He had not forbidden.” With such a false argument, the previous disbelievers argued, and they are liars. Allah commanded them and forbade them and enabled them to do what He charged them with and gave them power and will from which their actions proceed. Their argument with fate and destiny is the most invalid of falsehoods after the Messengers warned them. The Messengers who warned them had no duty except to clearly convey what they were charged with. And We sent to every nation that preceded them a Messenger commanding them to worship Allah and obey Him alone and to abandon the worship of other than Him from the devils, idols, the dead, and other than that which is taken as a protector besides Allah. So among them were those whom Allah guided and followed the Messengers, and among them were those who were obstinate and followed the path of error, so misguidance was obligatory upon them, but Allah did not guide them. So walk in the land and see with your own eyes how was the end of these deniers and what destruction befell them, so that you may take heed. If you, O Messenger, exert your utmost effort to guide these polytheists, then know that Allah does not guide those who They go astray, and they have no one besides God to help them and prevent His punishment from them.

And these polytheists swore solemn oaths to God that God would not resurrect those who died after they had perished and been dispersed. Yes, God will surely resurrect them. It is a promise binding upon Him, but most people do not know God’s ability to resurrect, so they deny it.

God resurrects all of His servants to show them the truth of the resurrection, about which they differed, and to teach the disbelievers who deny it that they are on falsehood and that they are lying when they swore that there would be no resurrection.

The matter of resurrection is easy for us, for when We want something, we only say to it, “Be,” and at once it is already in existence."
m-0546	And those who left their homes for the sake of Allah and emigrated after injustice had befallen them - We will surely settle them in this world in a good home, and the reward of the Hereafter is greater, for their reward therein is Paradise. If those who stayed behind had known with certainty what reward Allah has for those who emigrate in His cause, none of them would have stayed behind. These emigrants in the cause of Allah are those who were patient with Allah’s commands and prohibitions and with His painful decrees, and they relied on their Lord alone, so they deserved this great status.
m-0547	And We did not send among those before you, O Messenger, except messengers from men, not from angels, to whom We revealed. And if you, O polytheists of Quraysh, do not believe in that, then ask the people of the previous books, so that they may tell you that the prophets were human beings, if you do not know that they are human beings. The verse is general in every issue of religion. If a person does not have knowledge of it, he should ask those who know it from the scholars who are firmly grounded in knowledge. And We sent the previous messengers with clear evidence and heavenly books, and We sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an so that you may clarify to the people what is hidden of its meanings and rulings, and so that they may ponder it and be guided by it. Do the disbelievers who plot schemes feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up, as He did with Korah, or that the punishment will come to them from a place they do not perceive or expect, or that the punishment will seize them while they are turning over in their travels and actions? So they will not outpace Allah, nor will they surpass Him, nor will they escape His punishment, for He is the Powerful, Whom nothing can render helpless. Or that Allah will seize them with a loss of wealth, lives, and fruits, or in a state of fear of His seizing them, for your Lord Are the disbelievers who plot and conspire secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up, as He did with Qarun, or that the punishment will come to them from a place they do not perceive or expect, or that the punishment will seize them while they are still in their travels and movements, so they will not outpace Allah nor surpass Him nor escape His punishment, for He is the Strong, Whom nothing is beyond His power, or that Allah will seize them with a loss of wealth, lives and fruits, or in a state of fear of His seizing them? Indeed, your Lord is Most Kind to His creation, Most Merciful to them?

Indeed, your Lord is Most Kind to His creation, Most Merciful to them? Are these disbelievers blind, so why? They look at what God has created of things that have a shadow, such as mountains and trees, whose shadows sometimes move to the right and sometimes to the left, according to the movement of the sun during the day and the moon at night. All of them are subject to the greatness and majesty of their Lord, and they are under His control, management, and dominance. To God alone prostrates everything in the heavens and the earth of creatures, and the angels prostrate to God, and they are not too proud to worship Him. He mentioned them specifically after the generality because of their virtue, honor, and the abundance of their worship. The angels fear their Lord, who is above them in essence, in power, and in the perfection of attributes, and they do what they are commanded to do in obedience to God. In the verse, there is proof of the attribute of loftiness and superiority for God over all of His creation, as befits His majesty and perfection.
m-0548	"And Allah said to His servants, ""Do not worship two gods. Your only god is one God, so fear Me alone."" To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, creation, dominion, and servants. To Him alone is due worship, obedience, and sincerity. Is it appropriate for you to fear other than Allah and worship Him? Whatever blessing you have, such as guidance, good health, abundant provision, children, and other things, is from Allah alone. He is the One who bestowed them upon you. Then, when illness, calamity, and famine befall you, to Allah alone you cry out in supplication. Then, when the calamity and illness are removed from you, a group of you, with their Lord, who has bestowed salvation upon them, take partners and allies with Him to deny Our blessings upon them, including the removal of calamity from them. So enjoy your worldly life, which is destined to perish. You will soon know the consequences of your disbelief and disobedience."
m-0549	And among the ugly deeds of their actions is that they assign to the idols which they have taken as gods, which know nothing and do not benefit or harm, a portion of their wealth which Allah has provided them, in order to draw closer to them. By Allah, you will surely be asked on the Day of Resurrection about what you used to invent of lies against Allah. And the disbelievers attribute daughters to Allah, saying, “The angels are the daughters of Allah.” Allah is far above what they say. And they attribute to themselves what they love of sons. And when someone comes to one of them informing him of the birth of a female, his face turns black with hatred for what he hears and is filled with grief and sorrow. He hides from his people, hating to meet them, immersed in the grief and shame that has displeased him because of the daughter who was born to him, and he is confused about the matter of this newborn, should he keep her alive in humiliation and disgrace or bury her alive in the dirt? Indeed, evil is the judgment that they have made, assigning daughters to Allah and males to them. For those who do not believe in the Hereafter and do not work for it, is the ugly characteristic of helplessness, need, ignorance and disbelief. And Allah has the highest attributes of perfection and independence from His creation, and He is the Exalted in His kingdom, the Wise in His management. And if Allah were to punish people With their disbelief and their fabrications, He has not left anyone on the earth who moves, but He keeps them until a specific time, which is the end of their terms. When their term comes, they will not be delayed for a short time, nor will they advance. Among their ugliness is that they attribute to God what they hate for themselves of daughters, and their tongues say falsely that they will have a good end, while in truth they will have the Fire, and that they will be abandoned and forgotten therein.
m-0550	By Allah, We have sent messengers to nations before you, O Messenger, but Satan made attractive to them what they did of disbelief, denial, and worshipping other than Allah. So he is responsible for misleading them in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a painful and painful punishment. And We have not sent down the Qur’an to you, O Messenger, except that you may make clear to the people that in which they differed of religion and rulings, so that the proof may be established against them by your clarification, and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe.
m-0551	And Allah sends down rain from the clouds, and thereby produces vegetation from the earth after it had been barren and dry. Indeed, in the sending down of rain and the growth of vegetation, there is evidence of Allah’s power over resurrection and His Oneness for a people who listen, reflect, obey Allah and fear Him. And indeed, for you, O people, in the livestock, which are camels, cows and sheep, there is a lesson. You have witnessed that We give you to drink from their udders milk coming out between excrement and blood, pure from all impurities, delicious, and the one who drinks it does not choke on it. And among Our blessings upon you is what you take from the fruits of palm trees and grapes, and you make it into an intoxicating wine. This was before they were forbidden, and good food. Indeed, in what was mentioned is evidence of Allah’s power for a people who understand the proofs and take heed from them. And your Lord, O Prophet, inspired the bee, saying, “Make for yourself homes in the mountains and in the trees, and in what people build of houses and roofs.” Then eat of every fruit you desire, and follow the paths of your Lord, made easy for you to seek provision in the mountains and among the trees. And He has made them easy for you, so that you do not go astray in returning to them. If it is far away, honey of different colors comes out of the bellies of the bees, including white, yellow, red, and other things. It is a cure for people’s diseases. In what the bees make, there is strong evidence of the power of their Creator for a people who reflect and take heed.
m-0552	Allah is your jailer, and He created you, then He will cause you to die at the end of your lives. Some of you will reach the worst stage of life, which is old age, as they were in their childhood, not knowing anything of what they used to know. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Powerful. His knowledge and power encompass everything. So Allah, who returned man to this state, is able to cause him to die and then resurrect him. Allah has favored some of you over others in what He has given you in this world of provision. Some of you are rich and some are poor, some are owners and some are slaves. So the owners do not give their slaves from what Allah has given them that which would make them partners with them and equal with them in wealth. So if they are not satisfied with that for themselves, then why were they satisfied to make partners for Allah from among His slaves? Indeed, this is one of the greatest injustices and ingratitudes for the blessings of Allah, the Almighty and Majestic. Allah, the Exalted, has made from among your kind mates so that your souls may find rest with them, and He has made for you from them children and from their offspring grandchildren, and He has provided you with good foods, such as fruits, grains, meats, and other things. So is it in falsehood about the divinity of their partners that they believe, and in the countless blessings of Allah that they deny and are not grateful? To Him alone be worshipped, glory be to Him
m-0553	The polytheists worship idols that do not have the power to give them anything from the sky, such as rain, nor from the earth, such as crops. They do not own anything, nor can they own it, because they are not able to. If you know that idols and statues do not benefit, then do not, O people, make for Allah likenesses similar to Him from among His creation, associating them with Him in worship. Indeed, Allah knows what you do, and you are heedless, not knowing your mistake and the evil of your end. Allah gave an example in which He showed the corruption of the belief of the polytheists: a man who is owned and unable to dispose of anything, and another man who is free and has lawful money that Allah has provided him with, and he has the power to dispose of it and give from it secretly and openly. Can a sane person say that the two men are equal? ​​Likewise, Allah, the Creator, the Owner, the Disposer, is not equal to His creation and His slaves. So how can you equate them? Praise be to Allah alone, for He is the One who deserves praise and commendation. Rather, most of the polytheists do not know that praise and blessings are for Allah and that He alone is the One who deserves worship. Allah gave another example to show the invalidity of polytheism: two men, one of whom is mute and deaf, who does not understand and does not understand, and is not able to The benefit of himself or others is a heavy burden on the one who is in charge of his affairs and supports him. If he sends him on a matter to be carried out, he will not succeed and will not bring him any good. Another man with sound senses benefits himself and others, orders fairness and is on a clear path with no crookedness in it. Are the two men equal in the eyes of the wise? How can you equate a mute, deaf idol with God, the Almighty, the Bestower of all good?
m-0554	And Allah, the Most High, knows what is hidden in the heavens and the earth. And the matter of the Resurrection in its speed is like a quick glance with the eye. Indeed, it is faster than that. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. And Allah, the Most High, the Most High, brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers after the period of pregnancy, not perceiving anything around you, and He made for you the means of perception of hearing, sight, and hearts, that you might thank Allah, the Most High, for those blessings and single Him out, the Most High, with worship. Did the polytheists not look at the birds, tamed to fly in the air between the heaven and the earth by the command of Allah? None holds them back from falling except Him, the Most High, by what He created for them and enabled them to do. Indeed, in that taming and holding are signs for a people who believe in what they see of the evidence of Allah’s power.
m-0555	And Allah, the Almighty, has made for you in your homes a place of comfort and stability with your families while you are residing in the cities. He has made for you in your travels tents and domes from the skins of animals, which are easy for you to carry during your travels and easy for you to set up during your stay after your travels. He has made for you from the wool of sheep and the hair of camels and the hair of goats furnishings for you, such as clothing, clothes, covers, bedding and adornments that you enjoy for a specified term and a known time. And Allah has made for you what you can take shade under from trees and other things. He has made for you in the mountains caves and caverns places to which you can resort when in need. He has made for you clothing from cotton and wool and other things that protect you from heat and cold. He has made for you from iron what protects you from stabbing and harm in your wars. As Allah has bestowed these blessings upon you, He completes His blessing upon you by explaining the true religion so that you may submit to the command of Allah alone and not associate anything with Him in His worship. If they turn away from you, O Messenger, after they have seen the signs, then do not grieve. All that is upon you is the clear notification of what you were sent with. As for guidance, that is to Us. These polytheists know. God’s blessing upon them by sending Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, to them, and then they deny his prophethood. Most of his people deny his prophethood, not acknowledge it.
m-0556	"And mention to them, O Messenger, what will happen on the Day of Resurrection when We send from every nation its Messenger as a witness to the faith of those who believed among them and the disbelief of those who disbelieved. Then those who disbelieved will not be permitted to apologize for what they did, nor will they be asked to please their Lord through repentance and righteous deeds, for the time for that has passed.

And when those who disbelieved witness the punishment of Allah in the Hereafter, nothing of it will be lightened for them, nor will they be given respite, nor will their punishment be delayed.

And when the polytheists see on the Day of Resurrection their gods which they worshipped along with Allah, they will say, ""Our Lord, these are our partners whom we used to worship instead of You."" Then the gods will speak, denying those who worshipped them, and will say, ""Indeed, you, O polytheists, are liars when you made us partners with Allah and worshipped us along with Him. We did not command you to do that, nor did we claim that we were deserving of divinity. So the blame is upon you.""

And the polytheists will show submission and obedience to Allah on the Day of Resurrection, and they will forget what they were fabricating of lies, and that their gods will intercede for them.

Those who denied the Oneness of Allah and your prophethood, O Messenger, and denied you and prevented others from believing in Allah and His Messenger. And remember, O Messenger, when We will send forth on the Day of Resurrection to every nation a witness over them, the Messenger whom God sent to them from among themselves and with their tongue. And We have brought you, O Messenger, as a witness over your nation. And We have sent down to you the Qur’an as an explanation of every matter that needs to be explained, such as the rulings on what is permissible and what is forbidden, reward and punishment, and other things, and so that it may be a guidance from misguidance and a mercy for those who believe and act upon it, and good tidings for the believers of their good destiny."
m-0557	Allah, the Almighty, commands His servants in this Qur’an to be just and fair towards Him by affirming His Oneness and not associating partners with Him, and towards His servants by giving each person his due right. He commands to be kind towards Him by worshipping Him and performing His duties in the prescribed manner, and towards people in words and deeds. He commands to give relatives what is necessary for their connection and kindness, and He forbids everything that is ugly in word or deed, and everything that the Shari’ah denies and does not approve of, such as disbelief and sins, and oppressing people and transgressing against them. With this command and this prohibition, Allah admonishes you and reminds you of the consequences so that you may remember Allah’s commands and benefit from them. Commit to fulfilling every covenant that you have made obligatory upon yourselves between you and Allah, the Almighty, or between you and people in what does not contradict the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet. Do not go back on your oaths after you have confirmed them, and you have made Allah your guarantor and guarantor when you made a covenant with Him. Indeed, Allah knows what you do and will reward you for it. Do not go back on your covenants, lest you be like a woman who spun a thread and perfected it. Then you break it. You make your oaths which you have sworn when you make a covenant a deception for those with whom you have made a covenant, and you break your covenant if you find a group with more wealth and benefit than those with whom you made a covenant. Allah is only testing you by what He has commanded you to do, fulfilling covenants, and what He has forbidden you to do, breaking them, and that He may make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that over which you differed in this world, concerning belief in Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. If Allah had willed, He could have guided you all, making you upon one religion, which is Islam and faith, and obligating you to it. But He, glory be to Him, misguides whom He wills of those from whom He knows to prefer misguidance, but He does not guide them out of justice from Him. And He guides whom He wills of those from whom He knows to prefer the truth, and He guides them out of His grace. And Allah will ask you all on the Day of Resurrection about what you used to do in this world, concerning what He has commanded you to do and what He has forbidden you to do, and He will reward you for that.
m-0558	And do not make the oaths you swear a deception for those to whom you swore, lest you perish after you were secure, like one whose foot slips after it has been firmly planted. And taste what displeases you of the torment in this world because of what you caused of preventing others from this religion because of what they saw from you of treachery. And for you in the Hereafter is a great torment. And do not break the covenant of Allah in order to exchange it for a small display of worldly pleasures. Indeed, what is with Allah of reward for fulfillment is better for you than this small price, if you are among the people of knowledge. So ponder the difference between the two good things of this world and the Hereafter. What you have of worldly debris will pass away, and what is with Allah of provision and reward for you will not disappear. And We will surely reward those who endured the hardships of the obligations, including fulfilling the covenant, with their reward according to their best deeds. So We will give them according to the least of them as We give them according to the highest of them, as a favor. Whoever does a righteous deed, whether male or female, while he is a believer in Allah and His Messenger - We will surely cause him to live in this world with a happy and peaceful life, even if his wealth is little. And We will surely reward them in the Hereafter according to the best of what they did in this world.
m-0559	"If you, O believer, want to read something from the Qur’an, seek refuge in Allah from the evil of Satan, who was banished from the mercy of Allah, saying, “I seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed.”

Satan has no power over the believers in Allah and His Messenger, and they rely on their Lord alone. His power is only over those who made him their helper and obeyed him, and those who, because of his obedience, associate others with Allah Almighty.

Satan has no power over the believers in Allah and His Messenger, and they rely on their Lord alone. His power is only over those who made him their helper and obeyed him, and those who, because of his obedience, associate others with Allah Almighty.

And if We replace one verse with another - and Allah is the Creator - and Allah knows best what is in the best interest of His creation by what He sends down of rulings at different times - the disbelievers say, “You, O Muhammad, are only a liar, inventing about Allah what He did not say.” And Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is not as they claim. Rather, most of them have no knowledge of their Lord, His law, or His rulings.

Say to them, O Messenger, “The Qur’an was not fabricated by Me, but Gabriel revealed it from your Lord with truth and justice, as confirmation for the believers, guidance from misguidance, and good tidings for those who submit and submit to Allah.” Lord of the worlds"
m-0560	"We know that the polytheists say that the Prophet received the Qur’an from a human being from the children of Adam, but they lied. The tongue of the one to whom they attributed the teaching of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, is foreign and does not speak clearly, while the Qur’an is Arabic, the ultimate in clarity and eloquence.

The disbelievers who do not believe in the Qur’an, God will not guide them to attain the truth, and they will have a painful and painful punishment in the Hereafter.

The only ones who fabricate lies are those who do not believe in God and His signs, and they are the liars in their saying that. As for Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, who believed in his Lord and submitted to Him, it is impossible for him to lie about God and say about Him what He did not say.

The only ones who fabricate lies are those who utter a word of disbelief and then apostatize after their belief, so upon them is the wrath of God, except for the one who was forced to utter disbelief, so he uttered it out of fear of destruction, and his heart is firm in faith, so there is no blame on him. But the one who utters disbelief and his heart is at peace with it, upon them is severe wrath from God, and they will have a great punishment, and that is because they preferred the world and its adornments and preferred it over the Hereafter and its reward, and God does not guide the disbelievers nor guide them to the truth and righteousness.
Only he who utters a word of disbelief and then apostatizes after his belief invents a lie. Upon them is wrath from Allah, except for he who is forced to utter disbelief, so he utters it out of fear of destruction, while his heart is firm in faith. There is no blame upon him. But whoever utters disbelief and his heart is reassured by it, upon them is severe wrath from Allah, and for them is a great punishment. This is because they preferred the world and its adornments and preferred it over the Hereafter and its reward. And Allah does not guide the disbelievers nor does He grant them success in the truth and righteousness. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed with disbelief and preference of the world over the Hereafter, so the light of guidance does not reach them. He has deafened their hearing to the signs of Allah, so they do not hear them with contemplation, and He has blinded their sight, so they do not see the proofs indicating the divinity of Allah. And those are the ones who are heedless of what Allah has prepared for them of punishment. Indeed, in the Hereafter they are the losers, the doomed, who spent their lives on that which will cause their torment and destruction."
m-0561	Then your Lord is for the oppressed in Mecca, whom the polytheists tortured until they agreed with them on what they were doing outwardly, so they tempted them by uttering what pleased them, while their hearts were at peace with faith. And when they were able to escape, they migrated to Medina, then they strove in the cause of God and were patient with the hardships of the obligations. Indeed, your Lord, after their repentance, is Forgiving of them, Merciful to them. And remind them, O Messenger, of the Day of Resurrection, when every soul will come to argue for itself and make excuses with all excuses, and God will pay every soul the recompense of what it did, without injustice to it, so He will not increase their punishment nor decrease their reward.
m-0562	Allah gave an example of the city of Mecca, which was safe from aggression and secure from hardship, and its provisions came to it easily and easily from every direction. But its people denied Allah’s blessings upon them and associated partners with Him and did not thank Him, so Allah punished them with hunger and fear from the raids of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his armies that used to frighten them, because of their disbelief and their false deeds. Allah sent to the people of Mecca a messenger from among themselves, the Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. They knew his lineage, truthfulness, and trustworthiness, but they did not accept what he brought to them and did not believe him. So the punishment of hardships, hunger, and fear overtook them, and their leaders were killed at Badr, while they were wronging themselves by associating partners with Allah and turning people away from His path.
m-0563	So eat, O believers, of what Allah has provided for you and made lawful and pleasant for you, and be grateful for Allah’s favor upon you by acknowledging it and spending it in obedience to Allah, if you are truly submissive to His command, obedient to Him, worshipping Him alone, with no partner or associate. Allah has only forbidden you dead animals, blood poured out from the slaughtered animal when it is slaughtered, the flesh of swine, and that which has been slaughtered for other than Allah. But whoever is compelled by necessity of fear of death to eat any of these forbidden things, and he is not wronging or exceeding the limit of necessity, then Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to him, and He will not punish him for what he has done. And do not say, O polytheists, about the lie that your tongues describe, “This is lawful because Allah has forbidden it,” and “This is unlawful because Allah has permitted it,” in order to invent lies about Allah by attributing what is lawful and unlawful to Him. Indeed, those who invent lies about Allah will not attain any good in this world or in the Hereafter. Their enjoyment in this world is a fleeting and insignificant enjoyment, and in the Hereafter they will have a painful punishment. And to the Jews We have forbidden what We informed you of before, O Messenger, and that is every animal with claws and fat. Cows and sheep, except what their backs carry or their intestines carry or is mixed with bone. And We did not wrong them by making it unlawful to them, but they were wronging themselves by disbelief and transgression, so they deserved the prohibition as a punishment for them. Then your Lord is Forgiving to those who committed sins while they were ignorant of their consequences and their necessitating the wrath of Allah. So every sinner against Allah, whether by mistake or intentionally, is ignorant of this consideration, even if he was aware of the prohibition, then they returned to Allah from their sins and reformed themselves and their deeds. Indeed, your Lord, after their repentance and reform, is Forgiving to them, Merciful to them.
m-0564	Ibrahim was an imam in goodness, obedient and submissive to Allah, not deviating from the religion of Islam, believing in the Oneness of Allah and not associating partners with Him. He was grateful for the blessings of Allah upon him. Allah chose him for His message and guided him to the straight path, which is Islam. We gave him in this world a good blessing, such as praise for him among others, being an example of him, and a righteous son. And indeed, with Allah in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous, the owners of high stations. Ibrahim was an imam in goodness, obedient and submissive to Allah, not deviating from the religion of Islam, believing in the Oneness of Allah and not associating partners with Him. He was grateful for the blessings of Allah upon him. Allah chose him for His message and guided him to the straight path, which is Islam. We gave him in this world a good blessing, such as praise for him among others, being an example of him, and a righteous son. And indeed, with Allah in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous, the owners of high stations. The Hereafter is for the righteous, the owners of the high stations. Then We revealed to you, O Messenger, to follow the religion of Islam as Abraham followed it, and to be steadfast upon it and do not deviate from it, for Abraham was not among those who associated others with God. God only made the glorification of the Sabbath by devoting themselves to worship on it for the Jews who differed on it against their Prophet and chose it instead of Friday, which they were commanded to glorify. Indeed, your Lord, O Messenger, will judge between those who differed on the Day of Resurrection regarding what they differed about against their Prophet, and He will reward each according to what he deserves.
m-0565	O Messenger, call, you and those who follow you, to the religion of your Lord and His straight path in the wise manner that Allah has revealed to you in the Book and the Sunnah. Address people in a manner that is appropriate for them and advise them with good advice that encourages them to do good and repels them from evil. Argue with them in the best manner of argument, with kindness and gentleness. All you have to do is convey the message, and you have conveyed it. As for their guidance, it is up to Allah alone. He knows best who has strayed from His path, and He knows best who is guided. And if you, O believers, want to take revenge on those who have transgressed against you, then do not increase what they have done to you. But if you are patient, it is better for you in this world with victory and in the Hereafter with a great reward. And be patient, O Messenger, with whatever harm has befallen you for the sake of Allah until relief comes to you. Your patience is only through Allah, for He is the One who helps you against it and makes you steadfast. Do not grieve over those who have opposed you and have not responded to your call, and do not be distressed by their deceit and plotting, for that will return to them with evil and calamity. Indeed, Allah, the Most High, is with those who fear Him by obeying what He has commanded and avoiding what He has forbidden, with victory and support, and with those who do good. Performing His duties, fulfilling His rights, and adhering to His obedience with His help, success, and victory
m-0566	Allah glorifies Himself and magnifies His status for His ability to do what no one else can do. There is no god but Him and no Lord but Him. He is the One who took His servant Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, for a period of the night, with his body and soul, while awake and not asleep, from the Sacred Mosque in Mecca to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, around which God blessed crops, fruits, and other things, and made it a place for many prophets to witness the wonders of God’s power and the evidence of His Oneness. God, glory be to Him, is the Hearer of all sounds, the Seeer of all sight, so He gives each what he deserves in this world and the Hereafter.
m-0567	"And just as Allah honored Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with the Night Journey, He honored Moses, peace be upon him, by giving him the Torah and making it a statement of the truth and guidance for the Children of Israel, including prohibiting them from taking anyone other than Allah Almighty as a guardian or a deity to whom they entrust their affairs.

O descendants of those whom We saved and carried with Noah in the Ark, do not associate partners with Allah in His worship and be grateful for His blessings, following the example of Noah, peace be upon him. Indeed, he was a servant who was grateful to Allah with his heart, tongue, and limbs.

And We informed the Children of Israel in the Torah that was revealed to them that they would inevitably cause corruption twice in the Holy House and its environs through injustice, killing the prophets, arrogance, tyranny, and aggression.

So when they caused the first corruption, We would send over them servants of Ours who were brave and strong, who would overcome them, kill them, and disperse them. So they would wander among their homes, causing corruption. And that was a promise that inevitably would happen because of the reason for it from them.

Then We restored to you, O Children of Israel, victory and supremacy over your enemies who had authority over you, and We increased your provisions. And your children, and We strengthened you and made you more numerous than your enemy, and that is because of your good deeds and your submission to Allah. If you do good deeds and words, then you have done good for yourselves, because the reward for that will return to you, and if you do evil, then the punishment for that will return to you. So when the time for the second corruption comes, We will send upon you your enemies again to humiliate you and defeat you, so that the signs of humiliation and disgrace will appear on your faces, and they will enter upon you the Holy House and destroy it as they destroyed it the first time, and they will completely destroy everything that fell under their hands. Perhaps your Lord, O Children of Israel, will have mercy on you after His vengeance if you repent and reform, and if you return to corruption and injustice, We will return to your punishment and humiliation, and We will make Hell for you and for the disbelievers in general a prison from which there is no exit ever. In this verse and the one before it, there is a warning to this nation against committing sins, lest it be afflicted with what afflicted the Children of Israel, for the laws of Allah are one and cannot be changed or altered."
m-0568	This Qur’an which We have sent down to Our servant Muhammad guides people to the best path, which is the religion of Islam, and gives good tidings to the believers who do what Allah has commanded them to do and refrain from what He has forbidden them that they will have a great reward, and that those who do not believe in the Hereafter and the reward therein - We have prepared for them a painful punishment in the Fire. Sometimes a person prays evil against himself, his children, or his wealth when he is angry, just as he prays for good. This is due to man’s ignorance and haste, and it is from Allah’s mercy towards him that He answers his prayer for good rather than evil, because He knows that he does not intend to do so, and man is naturally hasty.
m-0569	"And We made the night and the day two signs indicating Our Oneness and Power. So We erased the sign of the night, which is the moon, and made the sign of the day, which is the sun, shining so that man may see in the light of day how to deal with the affairs of his livelihood and to settle down at night to rest and to know the people from the succession of night and day the number of years and the calculation of months and days so that they may arrange according to them what they wish of their interests. And We have explained everything sufficiently. And every person, Allah makes what he has done of good or evil constant with him, so he is not held accountable for the work of another, nor is another held accountable for his work. And Allah will bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book in which his deeds have been recorded, and he will see it open. It will be said to him, “Read the book of your deeds,” so he will read, even if he did not know how to read in this world. Your soul is sufficient for you today, counting your deeds against you, so you will know what recompense is due to it. And this is from the greatest justice and fairness, that it is said to the servant, “Hold yourself accountable, it is sufficient as a reckoner against you.” Whoever is guided and follows the path of truth, the reward for that will return to him alone, and whoever deviates and follows the path of falsehood, the punishment for that will return to him alone, and no sinful soul will bear the sin of another sinful soul, and Allah will not punish anyone except after establishing The argument against him is by sending messengers and revealing books

And when We wanted to destroy the people of a town for their injustice, We commanded their affluent ones to obey Allah, to believe in His Oneness, and to believe in His messengers, and others followed them, but they disobeyed the command of their Lord and denied His messengers, so the word of the inevitable punishment came true upon them, so We exterminated them with complete destruction

And many a nation We destroyed after the Prophet of Allah, Noah. And sufficient is your Lord, O Messenger, that He is All-Knowing of all the deeds of His servants; nothing is hidden from Him."
m-0570	"Whoever seeks the immediate world and strives for it alone and does not believe in the Hereafter and does not work for it, Allah will hasten for him in it what Allah wills and desires from what He has written for him in the Preserved Tablet. Then Allah will make for him in the Hereafter Hell, which he will enter, blamed and expelled from His mercy, the Almighty and Majestic, because of his desire for the world and his striving for it rather than the Hereafter. Whoever intends through his righteous deeds the reward of the eternal Hereafter and strives for it through obedience to Allah, the Almighty, and he believes in Allah, His reward and His great recompense, then those are the ones whose work is accepted and saved for them with their Lord, and they will be rewarded for it. 

Every group of workers for the transient world and workers for the eternal Hereafter, We will increase from Our provision, so We provide for the believers and the disbelievers in this world, for provision is from the gift of your Lord, as a favor from Him, and the gift of your Lord is not withheld from anyone, whether he is a believer or a disbeliever. 

Reflect, O Messenger, on how Allah favors some people over others in this world in provision and work, and the Hereafter has greater degrees for the believers and greater preference."
m-0571	"O man, do not make a partner with Allah in His worship, lest you be blamed and let down. Your Lord, O man, has commanded and made it obligatory and binding to single out Allah, the Most High, for worship. He has commanded to be kind to the father and mother, especially in old age. Do not be impatient or find anything you see from one of them or both of them burdensome. Do not hear them say anything bad, not even a groan, which is the lowest level of bad speech. Do not do anything ugly to them, but be gentle with them and always say soft and kind words to them. Be humble and humble to your mother and father, out of mercy for them, and ask your Lord to have mercy on them with His vast mercy, alive and dead, just as they were patient in raising you as a child, weak in strength and power. Your Lord, O people, knows best what is in your hearts, good and evil. If your will and intentions are to please Allah and to bring you closer to Him, then He, the Most High, is Forgiving to those who return to Him at all times. Whoever Allah knows that there is nothing in his heart except repentance to Him and love for Him, then He pardons him and forgives him for the minor sins that he commits, including: It is a requirement of human nature

Be good to everyone who is related to you and give him his due of kindness and righteousness and give to the poor and needy and the traveler who is cut off from his family and his money and do not spend your money in anything other than obedience to Allah or in a way of extravagance and waste

The extravagant and spend their money in disobeying Allah are like the devils in evil, corruption and disobedience and the devil is very ungrateful and very ungrateful for the blessings of his Lord

And if you turn away from giving to those whom you have been ordered to give because there is nothing to give them from it in order to seek provision that you await from your Lord, then speak to them with gentle and kind words such as praying for them to be rich and have ample provision and promising them that if Allah makes provision easy from His bounty, you will give them from it

And do not hold back your hand from spending in the way of good, restricting yourself, your family and the needy and do not be extravagant in spending so that you give beyond your capacity and then you sit blamed and people blame you and criticize you, regretting your extravagance and the loss of your money

Your Lord expands provision for some people and restricts it for others according to His knowledge and wisdom Glory be to Him, He is the One who knows the secrets of His servants. Nothing of their conditions is hidden from His knowledge."
m-0572	And if you know that provision is in the hand of Allah, the Most High, then do not kill your children, O people, for fear of poverty, for He, the Most High, is the Provider for His servants. He provides for children as He provides for fathers. Indeed, killing children is a great sin. And do not approach adultery and its motives so that you do not fall into it. Indeed, it was an extremely ugly act and an evil path. And do not kill the soul that Allah has forbidden to be killed except by a legal right, such as retaliation, or stoning the married adulterer, or killing the apostate. And whoever is killed without a legal right, We have given his guardian, whether an heir or a judge, an argument in demanding the killing of his killer or blood money. And it is not right for the guardian of the murdered person to exceed the limit of Allah in retaliation, such as killing two or a group for one person, or mutilating the killer. Indeed, Allah helps the guardian of the murdered person against the killer until he is able to kill him in retaliation. And do not dispose of the money of children whose fathers have died and are in your care except in the way that is best for them, which is investment and development until the orphan child reaches the age of puberty. And manage the money well, and fulfill every covenant that you have committed to, for Allah will ask its owner about a covenant on the Day of Resurrection. And give him full measure and do not reduce it when you measure for others, and weigh with a fair balance. Indeed, justice in measure and weight is better for you in this world and the best outcome with Allah in the Hereafter.
m-0573	"And do not follow, O man, what you do not know, but be certain and confirm that man is responsible for what he uses his hearing, sight, and heart for. If he uses them for good, he will receive reward, and if he uses them for evil, he will receive punishment.

And do not walk on the earth arrogantly, for you will not tear the earth apart by walking on it, and you will not reach the mountains in height out of arrogance and haughtiness.
All of the aforementioned commands and prohibitions, God hates the evil of them and does not accept them for His servants.
That which we have explained and clarified from these great rulings of commanding good deeds and forbidding vile morals is what We have revealed to you, O Prophet. And do not, O man, make a partner with God Almighty in His worship, lest you be thrown into the fire of Hell, and your soul and the people will blame you, and you will be banished and removed from all good."
m-0574	"Your Lord has singled you out, O polytheists, by giving you sons and taking for Himself daughters for the angels. Indeed, your statement is extremely ugly and hideous and does not befit Allah, the Most High.

And We have explained and diversified in this Qur’an the rulings, examples, and sermons so that people may learn a lesson and ponder what benefits them so they may take it and what harms them so they may abandon it. And the clarification and explanation do not increase the wrongdoers except in distancing themselves from the truth and neglecting to consider and consider.

Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists, “If there were other gods with Allah, then those gods would seek a way to overcome Allah, the Lord of the Mighty Throne.”
Allah is far above what the polytheists say, and He is exalted, far above.

The seven heavens and the earths and all that is in them from all creatures glorify Him, and everything in this existence glorifies Allah, the Most High, with glorification coupled with praise and thanks to Him, the Most High. But you do not realize, O people, that He, the Most High, is Forbearing with His servants. He does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him, and is Forgiving of them."
m-0575	And if you recite the Qur’an and these polytheists hear it, We have placed between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter a veil that conceals their minds from understanding the Qur’an as a punishment for their disbelief and denial. And We have placed coverings over the hearts of the polytheists so that they do not understand the Qur’an, and We have placed deafness in their ears so that they do not hear it. And if you mention your Lord in the Qur’an, calling to His Oneness and forbidding polytheism with Him, they turn back on their heels, averse to your words, arrogant and too proud to worship God alone. We know best what the leaders of Quraysh are listening to when they listen to you, and their intentions are bad. Their listening is not for the sake of seeking guidance and accepting the truth. We know their whispering when they say, “You follow none but a man who has been afflicted with magic, so his mind has become confused.” Think, O Messenger, in amazement at their saying that Muhammad is a magician, a mad poet, and they have gone astray and have not been guided to the path of truth and righteousness.
m-0576	"The polytheists said, denying that they would be created anew after their bones had decayed and become crumbs, ""Will we indeed be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection with a new resurrection?"" Say to them, O Messenger, in a way that makes them incapable: ""Be like stones or iron in strength and power if you are able to do that, for Allah will return you as He began you, and that is easy and simple for Him."" Or be a creation whose acceptance of resurrection is considered great and difficult in your minds, for Allah is able to return you and resurrect you. And when the proof is established against them regarding Allah's ability to resurrect and bring you back to life, they will say, denying: ""Who will return us to life after death?"" Say to them: ""It is Allah who created you from nothing the first time."" And when they hear this response, they will shake their heads in mockery and astonishment and say, ""When will this resurrection take place?"" Say: ""It is near, for everything that comes is near."" The day your Creator will call you to come out of your graves, and you will respond to Allah's command and submit to Him, and to Him is praise in every situation, and you will think, due to the terror of the Day of Resurrection, that you did not stay in this world except for a short time because of the length of your stay in the Hereafter."
m-0577	And tell My believing servants to speak in their conversations and dialogues good and pure speech, for if they do not do that, Satan will cast between them enmity, corruption, and quarrel. Indeed, Satan has been an enemy to man, openly hostile. Your Lord knows you best, O mankind. If He wills, He will have mercy upon you and guide you to faith; or if He wills, He will cause you to die in disbelief and punish you. And We have not sent you, O Messenger, over them as a guardian to manage their affairs and recompense them for their deeds. Your task is only to convey what you were sent with and to explain the straight path. And your Lord, O Prophet, knows best who is in the heavens and the earth. And We have certainly preferred some prophets over others by virtues and by many followers and by sending down the Books, and We gave David the Psalms. Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists of your people, that these deities that you call upon to relieve your distress do not possess that, nor are they able to transfer it from you to someone else, nor are they able to change it from one state to another. The One who is able to do that is Allah alone. This verse is general in all that is called upon besides Allah, whether dead or absent, from the prophets, the righteous, and others, by the wording of seeking help or Supplication or otherwise, there is no true god but God
m-0578	Those whom the polytheists call upon from among the prophets, the righteous, and the angels with Allah compete in nearness to their Lord with whatever good deeds they are able to do, and they hope for His mercy and fear His punishment. Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is what the servants should beware of and fear. Allah threatens the disbelievers that there is no disbelieving town that rejects the messengers except that He will send down His punishment upon it by destruction in this world before the Day of Resurrection, or by severe punishment for its people. This is a book that Allah has written and a decree that He has decreed. It must happen, and it is written in the Preserved Tablet.
m-0579	And what prevented Us from sending down the miracles that the polytheists asked for was the denial of the nations that preceded them. Allah answered them to what they asked for, but they denied it and perished. And We gave Thamud, the people of Salih, a clear miracle, which was the she-camel, but they disbelieved in it, so We destroyed them. And Our sending of the messengers with signs and lessons and the miracles that We placed at their hands was only to frighten the servants, so that they might reflect and remember. And remember, O Messenger, when We said to you, “Indeed, your Lord encompasses mankind in knowledge and power.” And We did not make the vision that We showed you with your own eyes on the Night of the Isra’ and Mi’raj from the wonders of creation except as a test for the people, so that their disbelievers might be distinguished from their believers. And We did not make the cursed tree of Zaqqum mentioned in the Qur’an except as a test for the people. And We frighten the polytheists with various types of punishment and signs, but frightening them only increases their persistence in disbelief and misguidance.
m-0580	And remember Our saying to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam as a greeting and honor.” So they all prostrated except Iblis, who was arrogant and refused to prostrate, saying, by way of denial and haughtiness, “Should I prostrate to this weak person created from clay?” Iblis said, in audacity toward God and disbelief in Him, “Have you seen this creature whom You have distinguished over me? If You keep me alive until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely seize his offspring by misleading and corrupting them, except for those who are sincere among them in faith, and they are few.” God Almighty said, threatening Iblis and his followers, “Go, and whoever follows you from the offspring of Adam and obeys you, then your punishment and their punishment will be abundant in the fire of Hell.” And belittle everyone you can belittle from them by calling them to disobey Me, and gather against them all your soldiers, riders and footmen, and make for yourself a share in their wealth by earning it unlawfully, and a share in the children by beautifying fornication and sins and disobeying the commands of God, until immorality and corruption increase. And make false promises to your followers from the offspring of Adam, for all the promises of Satan are false and deceitful. Indeed, My believing servants The faithful who obeyed me, you have no power to seduce them, and your Lord is sufficient, O Prophet, as a protector and guardian of the believers from the plot and deception of Satan.
m-0581	"Your Lord, O people, is the One Who sends ships for you in the sea so that you may seek Allah's provision in your travels and trade. Indeed, Allah, the Exalted, is Merciful to His servants.

And when hardship befalls you at sea until you are on the verge of drowning and destruction, the gods you worship are absent from your minds, and you remember Allah, the Almighty, alone, to help you and save you, so you are sincere to Him in seeking help and relief, so He helps you and saves you. But when He saves you to the land, you turn away from faith, sincerity, and righteous deeds. This is from the ignorance and disbelief of man, and man is ungrateful for the blessings of Allah, the Almighty.

O people, have you forgotten the punishment of Allah, so you feel secure that the earth will not collapse upon you in a landslide, or that Allah will rain down stones from the sky upon you and kill you, then you will not find anyone to protect you from His punishment?

O people, have you felt secure that your Lord, while you have disbelieved in Him, will return you to the sea again, and send upon you a violent wind that will destroy everything it comes upon, and drown you because of your disbelief, then you will not find any accountability or claim against us, for Allah has not wronged you by the weight of a grain. And We have certainly honored the descendants of Adam with reason and sending messengers, and We have subjected to them all that is in the universe, and We have subjected to them the beasts of burden on land and the ships on sea to carry them, and We have provided for them of the good things in food and drink, and We have preferred them over many of the creatures with a great preference."
m-0582	"Remember, O Messenger, the Day of Resurrection, bringing good tidings and warning, when Allah, the Almighty, will call every group of people with their leader whom they followed in this world. Whoever among them was righteous and was given his book of deeds in his right hand, they will read their book of good deeds, happy and cheerful, and nothing will be diminished from the reward of their righteous deeds, even if it was the size of a thread in the crack of a seed. Whoever in this world was blind of heart to the evidence of Allah’s power and did not believe in what the Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, brought, will be even more blind on the Day of Resurrection to the path of Paradise and even more astray from guidance and righteousness. 

The polytheists came close to turning you, O Messenger, away from the Qur’an that Allah revealed to you, so that you might fabricate for us something other than what We revealed to you. If you had done what they wanted, they would have taken you as a pure beloved. 

And had We not established you on the truth and protected you from agreeing with them, you would have come close to inclining towards them a little, due to the abundance of treatment and your desire for their guidance. 

And if you, O Messenger, had inclined towards these polytheists a little in what they asked of you, then We would have made you taste the torment of life in this world like me. And like me is the punishment of death in the Hereafter, and that is because of the perfection of Allah’s favor upon you and the perfection of your knowledge, then you will not find anyone to support you and repel from you Our punishment.

And the disbelievers were close to expelling you from Mecca by their disturbance of you, and if they had expelled you from it, they would not have remained in it after you except a short time until the immediate punishment befalls them.

That is the way of Allah the Most High in destroying the nation that expels its Messenger from among them, and you will not find, O Messenger, any change in Our way, so there is no breach of Our promise."
m-0583	"Establish the prayer completely from the time of the sun’s zenith at noon until the time of darkness of the night, and this includes the Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha prayers. Establish the Fajr prayer and prolong the recitation in it, for the Fajr prayer is attended by the angels of the night and the angels of the day. 

And rise, O Prophet, from your sleep some of the night and recite the Qur’an in the night prayer so that the night prayer may increase your status and raise your ranks. Perhaps Allah will send you as an intercessor for the people on the Day of Resurrection so that Allah may have mercy on them for what they are in, and you will stand in a position where the first and the last will praise you. 

And say, O my Lord, let me enter into that which is best for me by a truthful entrance and take me out of that which is worst for me by a truthful exit. And grant me from Yourself a firm argument by which You will grant me victory over all who oppose me. 

And say, O Messenger, to the polytheists, “Islam has come and polytheism has gone. Falsehood has no permanence or stability. The truth is the firm, everlasting one that does not disappear.” 

And We send down from the verses of the Great Qur’an what heals the hearts from diseases such as doubt, hypocrisy, and ignorance, and what heals the bodies by enchanting them with it, and what is a reason for winning the mercy of Allah because of the faith in it. And this Qur’an does not increase the disbelievers when they hear it except Disbelief and misguidance for their denial of him and their lack of faith"
m-0584	And if We bestowed upon man wealth, health, and the like, he turned away and distanced himself from obeying his Lord. And if he was afflicted with hardship, such as poverty or illness, he was despairing, because he does not trust in the grace of Allah, the Most High, except for those whom Allah protected in both good and bad times. Say, O Messenger, to the people: Each one of you acts according to what is appropriate for him from the circumstances, for your Lord knows best who is best guided to the path of truth. And the disbelievers ask you about the reality of the soul, out of stubbornness, so answer them that the reality of the soul and its circumstances are among the matters whose knowledge Allah has kept to Himself, and you and all the people have been given only a little knowledge. And if We willed to erase the Qur’an from your heart, We could have done so, and then you would not find for yourself a supporter to prevent Us from doing that or to return the Qur’an to you. But Allah has had mercy on you, so establish that in your heart, for His grace upon you has been great. He has given you this great Qur’an and the praised station, and other things that He has not given to anyone in the worlds.
m-0585	Say, “If mankind and the jinn were to agree to attempt to produce the like of this miraculous Qur’an, they could not produce it, even if they cooperated and cooperated in that.” And We have certainly made clear to the people in this Qur’an every kind of example that should be considered, as an argument for them to follow it and act upon it, but most of the people refused except in denial of the truth and rejection of the proofs and evidence of Allah.
m-0586	When the Qur’an defeated the polytheists and overcame them, they began to ask for miracles according to their whims, saying, “We will not believe you, O Messenger, and act upon what you say until you cause a flowing spring to gush forth for us from the land of Mecca, or you have a garden containing various types of palm trees and grapes, and you cause rivers to flow abundantly through its midst, or you cause the sky to fall upon us in pieces as you claimed, or you bring to us God and His angels so that we may see them face to face, or you have a house of gold, or you ascend a stairway to heaven, and we will not believe you in your ascent until you return with a book from God published in which we read that you are truly the Messenger of God.” Say, O Messenger, astonished at the stubbornness of these disbelievers, “Glory be to my Lord! Am I but a servant of His servants, conveying His message? How can I be able to do what you ask?” What prevented the disbelievers from believing in God and His Messenger and obeying them when sufficient clarification came to them from God was their saying, out of ignorance and denial, “Did God send a Messenger from among the human race?” Say, O Messenger, in response to the polytheists’ denial that the Messenger could be from among the human race, “If there were angels on the earth walking upon it securely, We would have sent to them a Messenger from among the Their kind, but the people of the earth are human beings, so the Messenger to them must be from their kind so that they can address him and understand his words. Say to them, “Sufficient is God as a witness between me and you regarding my truthfulness and the reality of my prophethood. He, glory be to Him, is All-Knowing of the conditions of His servants, All-Seeing of their deeds, and He will reward them for them.”
m-0587	And he whom Allah guides, he is the one who is guided to the truth, and he whom He misguides, He abandons and leaves him to himself, for there is no guide for him other than Allah. And these misguided ones, Allah will resurrect them on the Day of Resurrection and gather them on their faces, and they will not see, nor speak, nor hear. Their destiny is the blazing fire of Hell. Whenever its flames subside and its fire dies out, We will increase them in blazing, blazing fire. This punishment that was described is a punishment for the polytheists because of their disbelief in the signs of Allah and His proofs and their denial of His messengers who called them to worship Him and their saying in disapproval when they were commanded to believe in the resurrection, “When we die and become rotten bones and disintegrated parts, will we be resurrected after that as a new creation?” These polytheists were heedless and did not see and know that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth and all that is in them of creatures without a previous example, is able to create the likes of them after their annihilation. And Allah has set a specific time for these polytheists’ death and punishment. There is no doubt that it will come to them, and despite the clarity of the truth and its evidence, they refused. The disbelievers are only ungrateful for the religion of God Almighty. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists: If you possessed the treasures of my Lord’s mercy that are inexhaustible and never perish, you would be stingy with them and not give from them to others for fear that they would run out and you would become poor. It is the nature of man to be stingy with what is in his hand, except for those whom God protects through faith.
m-0588	And We gave Moses nine clear miracles that testified to the truth of his prophethood, and they were the staff, the hand, the years, the decrease in fruits, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, and the blood. So ask, O Messenger, the Jews a question of confirmation when Moses came to their ancestors with his clear miracles. Pharaoh said to Moses, “I think, O Moses, that you are a deceived magician, overcome by your mind with the strange deeds you perform.” Moses replied, “I am certain, O Pharaoh, that none sent down these nine miracles that testify to the truth of my prophethood except the Lord of the heavens and the earth, so that they may be signs by which those with insight may prove the Oneness of God Almighty in His Lordship and Divinity. And I am certain that, O Pharaoh, you are doomed, cursed, and defeated.” So Pharaoh wanted to disturb Moses and expel him and the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, so we drowned him and those with him from the army in the sea as a punishment for them. And We said, after the destruction of Pharaoh and his army, to the children of Israel, “Dwell in the land of Ash-Sham, and when the Day of Resurrection comes, We will bring you all from your graves to the place of reckoning.”
m-0589	And in truth We sent down this Qur’an to Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, to command and prohibit the servants, to reward and punish them, and with truth, justice, and protection from change and alteration, it was sent down. And We have not sent you, O Messenger, except as a bearer of good tidings of Paradise for those who obey, and a frightener of Hell for those who disobey and disbelieve. And We have sent down to you, O Messenger, a Qur’an which We have made clear, perfected, and detailed, distinguishing between guidance and misguidance, truth and falsehood, so that you may recite it to the people slowly and carefully. And We have sent it down piece by piece, little by little, according to the events and requirements of the circumstances. Say, O Messenger, to these deniers: Believe in the Qur’an or do not believe, for your belief does not increase its perfection, and your denial does not cause it to be diminished. Indeed, the scholars who were given the previous scriptures before the Qur’an and knew the truth of the revelation, when the Qur’an is recited to them, they humble themselves and prostrate on their faces to God, the Most High, the Most Great. And those who were given knowledge say upon hearing the Qur’an, glorifying our Lord and exonerating Him from what the polytheists describe Him as, “The promise of God Almighty of reward and punishment has never been but a true reality.” And they fall prostrate on their faces, weeping, moved by the admonitions of the Qur’an, and hearing the Qur’an and its admonitions increases their submission to the command of Allah and His great power. Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists of your people who denied your supplication by saying, “O Allah, O Most Gracious,” “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Gracious, and by whichever of His names do you call upon Him? You are calling upon one Lord, for all His names are beautiful. And do not recite aloud in your prayer lest the polytheists hear you, and do not recite it quietly lest your companions hear you. And be moderate between recitation aloud and whispering. And say, O Messenger, “Praise be to Allah, to whom belongs perfection and praise, who is free from having a son or partner in His divinity, and He has no guardian among His creation, for He is the Rich, the Strong, and they are the poor who need Him. And glorify Him with complete glorification by praising Him and worshipping Him alone, with no partner, and devoting all religion to Him alone.”
m-0590	"Praise be to Allah for His attributes, all of which are descriptions of perfection, and for His apparent and hidden religious and worldly blessings, who favored Him by sending down to His servant and Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, the Qur’an, and did not include in it any deviation from the truth.

Allah made it a straight Book, with no differences or contradictions in it, to warn the disbelievers of a severe punishment from Him, and to give good tidings to those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, who do righteous deeds, that they will have a great reward, which is Paradise, in which they will reside and never leave.

And to warn with it the polytheists who said, “Allah has taken a son.”

These polytheists do not have any knowledge of what they claim about Allah taking a son, just as their predecessors who imitated them did not have. This heinous statement that comes out of their mouths is great. They say nothing but a lie.

So perhaps, O Messenger, you will be destroyed. Fill yourself with grief and sorrow over the consequences of your people turning away from you if they do not believe in this Qur’an and act upon it."
m-0591	Indeed, We have made the creatures on the face of the earth as beauty for it and benefit for its people, that We may test them as to which of them is best in their deeds of obedience to Us and which of them is worst in their deeds of disobedience. And We will reward each according to what he deserves. And indeed, We will make whatever is on the earth of that adornment, at the end of the world, dust in which there is no vegetation.
m-0592	"Do not think, O Messenger, that the story of the People of the Cave and the tablet on which their names were written is among Our signs, strange and wondrous. Indeed, the creation of the heavens and the earth and what is in them is more wondrous than that.

Remember, O Messenger, when the believing youths took refuge in the cave, fearing that their people would tempt them and force them to worship idols. They said, “Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy by which to make us steadfast and protect us from evil and make easy for us the right path that will lead us to the work that You love, so that we may be rightly guided and not astray.”

So We cast upon them a deep sleep, and they remained in the cave for many years.

Then We awakened them from their sleep to show the people what We had known in eternity, so that they might distinguish which of the two disputing parties was more accurate in counting, whether they remained a day or part of a day or a long period.

We relate to you, O Messenger, their story in truth. The People of the Cave were young men who believed in their Lord and obeyed His command. And We increased them in guidance and steadfastness upon the truth.

And We strengthened their hearts with faith and strengthened their resolve with it when they stood before the disbelieving king while he was blaming them. On abandoning the worship of idols, they said to him, ""Our Lord whom we worship is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. We will not worship other than Him among the gods. If we said other than this, we would have said an unjust statement far from the truth."" Then some of them said to each other, ""These are our people who have taken for themselves gods other than God. Why do they not bring clear evidence for their worship of them? No one is more unjust than he who fabricates a lie against God by attributing a partner to Him in His worship."" And when you left your people with your religion and abandoned what they worshiped of gods except the worship of God, then take refuge in the cave in the mountain to worship your Lord alone. Your Lord will extend to you from His mercy what will cover you with in both abodes and will make easy for you your affair what will benefit you in your life from the causes of livelihood."
m-0593	When they did that, God cast sleep upon them and protected them. You see, O observer, that when the sun rises from the east, it inclines away from their place to the right, and when it sets, it leaves them to the left, and they are in a spacious area of ​​the cave, so the heat of the sun does not harm them, nor does the air cut off from them. That which We did to these young men is evidence of the power of God. Whoever God guides to be guided by His signs, he is guided to the truth, and whoever He does not guide to that, you will not find anyone to help him to reach the truth, because success and failure are in the hand of God alone. And you think, O observer, that the people of the cave are awake, but in reality they are asleep. We take care of them, so we turn them over while they are asleep, once to the right side and once to the left side, lest the earth consume them, and their dog that accompanied them stretched out its arms in the courtyard of the cave. If you saw them, you would turn away from them, fleeing, and you would be filled with fear of them. And just as We put them to sleep and protected them for this long period, We awakened them from their sleep in their original state, without any change, so that some of them would ask each other, “How long did we remain asleep here?” Some of them said, “We remained a day or part of a day,” and others said, The matter became confusing to them, so they entrusted the knowledge of that to God. Your Lord knows best the time you stayed. So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to our city. Let him see which of the people of the city has the most lawful and delicious food. Let him bring you some of it and be gentle in buying it with the seller so that we are not exposed and our matter becomes apparent, and no one among the people knows about you. If your people find out about you, they will stone you with stones and kill you, or return you to their religion and you will become disbelievers. You will never achieve your goal of entering Paradise if you do that.
m-0594	And as We put them to sleep for many years and then awakened them, We informed the people of that time about them after the seller revealed the type of dirhams that their messenger had brought to teach the people that the promise of Allah for resurrection is true and that the Resurrection is coming without a doubt, as those who knew about the People of the Cave disputed about the matter of the Resurrection, so who confirmed it and who denied it, so Allah made their knowledge of the People of the Cave an argument for the believers against the disbelievers. And after their matter was revealed and they died, a group of those who knew about them said, “Build a structure over the entrance of the cave that will conceal them and leave them to their own devices, their Lord knows their situation best.” And the people of influence and power over them said, “Let us build a mosque for worship in their place.” And the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, forbade taking the graves of the prophets and righteous people as mosques and cursed whoever did that in his last will to his nation. He also forbade building over graves absolutely and plastering them and writing on them because that is an exaggeration that may lead to worshipping those in them. Some of the People of the Book who delve into their matter will say, “They are three, their dog is the fourth,” and another group will say, “They are five, their dog is the sixth.” The speech of both groups is based on conjecture without evidence. A third group says that they are seven and the eighth is their dog. Say, “O Messenger, my Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows their number except a few of His creation. So do not argue with the People of the Book about their number except an apparent argument without depth, by only narrating to them what the revelation has informed you of, and do not ask them about their number and their circumstances, for they do not know that.”
m-0595	And never say about something you intend to do, “I will do that tomorrow,” unless you make your statement dependent on the will of God, by saying, “God willing.” And remember your Lord when you forget by saying, “God willing.” And whenever you forget, remember God, for the remembrance of God removes forgetfulness. And say, “Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the shortest paths that lead to guidance and right conduct.” And never say about something you intend to do, “I will do that tomorrow,” unless you make your statement dependent on the will of God, by saying, “God willing.” And remember your Lord when you forget by saying, “God willing.” And whenever you forget, remember God, for the remembrance of God removes forgetfulness. And say, “Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the shortest paths that lead to guidance and right conduct.”
m-0596	And the young men remained asleep in their cave for three hundred and nine years. If you are asked, O Messenger, about the duration of their stay in the cave and you do not have knowledge of that or a confirmation from God, then do not advance anything about it, but say, God knows best the duration of their stay. He has the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He sees and hears. That is, marvel at the perfection of His sight and hearing and His encompassing of everything. There is no one for creation other than Him who takes care of their affairs and He has no partner in His rule, judgment, and legislation. Glory be to Him, the Most High.
m-0597	And recite, O Messenger, what Allah has revealed to you of the Qur’an, for it is the Book whose words cannot be changed, for its truth and justice. And you will not find besides your Lord a refuge to which you may turn, nor a sanctuary in which you may seek protection. And be patient, O Prophet, with your companions from the poor believers who worship their Lord alone and call upon Him morning and evening, seeking thereby His countenance. Sit with them and mix with them, and do not turn your gaze away from them to others from the disbelievers, desiring to enjoy the adornments of worldly life. And do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, and who has preferred his own desires over the obedience of his Master, and whose affair in all his actions has become loss and destruction.
m-0598	"And say to these heedless ones, ""What I have brought to you is the truth from your Lord. So whoever among you desires to believe and act upon it, let him do so; for it is better for him. And whoever desires to deny, let him do so. For he has wronged none but himself. Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers a severe Fire whose wall will encompass them. And if these disbelievers in the Fire cry out for water due to intense thirst, they will be given water like murky oil, intensely hot, which will scald their faces. How ugly is this drink that does not quench their thirst, but rather increases it. And how ugly is the Fire as a dwelling and abode for them."" In this is a severe warning and threat to those who turn away from the truth and do not believe in the message of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and do not act according to its requirements. Indeed, those who believe in God and His Messenger and do righteous deeds will have the greatest reward. Indeed, We will not waste their rewards, nor will We diminish them for what they did well in deeds. Those who have believed will have Gardens in which they will abide forever. Fresh rivers will flow beneath their chambers and dwellings. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments woven from fine and coarse silk. They will recline therein on beds adorned with beautiful curtains. What an excellent reward! Their reward is good and Paradise is a good home and place for them."
m-0599	"And, O Messenger, give to the disbelievers of your people an example: two men from the previous nations, one of them a believer and the other a disbeliever. And We made for the disbeliever two gardens of grapevines, and We surrounded them with many palm trees, and We caused to grow in their midst various beneficial crops. And each of the two gardens produced its fruit, and did not decrease in any of it, and We caused a river to grow between them for easy and simple irrigation. And the owner of the two gardens had fruit and other wealth, so he said to his believing companion while he was conversing with him in a conversation filled with arrogance, “I am richer than you, and I have more supporters and helpers.” And he entered his garden while he was wronging himself by disbelieving in the Resurrection and doubting the coming of the Hour, and its fruits pleased him and he said, “I do not believe that this garden will perish during this lifetime, and I do not believe that the Resurrection will occur, even if it is assumed that it will occur as you claim, O believer, and I return to my Lord, I will surely find with Him better than this garden, a place of reference and a return for my honor and status with Him.” And he entered his garden while he was wronging himself by disbelieving in the Resurrection and doubting the coming of the Hour, and its fruits pleased him and he said, “I do not believe that this garden will perish during this lifetime.” And I do not believe that the Resurrection will happen, even if it is assumed that it will happen as you claim, O believer, and I return to my Lord, I will find with Him something better than this garden, a place of reference and a return for my honor and status with Him. His believing companion said to him while he was conversing with him, admonishing him, “How can you disbelieve in God, who created you from dust, then from the sperm of your parents, then formed you into a human being of moderate stature and build?” And in this conversation is evidence that the One who is able to initiate creation is able to bring them back. But I do not say what you said, which indicates your disbelief, rather I say that the Benefactor and the Generous is God, my Lord alone, and I do not associate anyone in my worship of Him other than Him. Why did you not, when you entered your garden and you were pleased, praise God and say, “This is what God has willed for me, I have no power to obtain it except through God.” If you see me as less than you in wealth and children, perhaps my Lord will give me something better than your garden and take away the blessing because of your disbelief and send a punishment from the sky upon your garden, so that it becomes a smooth, barren land on which no foot can stand and no plant grows in it, or its water from which you irrigate it becomes sunken in the ground so that you are not able to

And why, when you entered your garden and you liked it, did you praise God and say, “This is what God willed for me, I have no power to obtain it except through God.” If you see me as having less wealth and children than you, then perhaps my Lord will give me something better than your garden and take away the blessing because of your disbelief and send a punishment from the sky upon your garden, so that it becomes a smooth, barren land on which no foot can stand and no plant can grow, or the water from which you water it will sink into the ground so that you are unable to extract it?

Why, when you entered your garden and you liked it, did you praise God and say, “This is what God willed for me, I have no power to obtain it except through God?” If you see me as having less wealth and children than you, then perhaps my Lord will give me something better than your garden and take away the blessing because of your disbelief and send a punishment from the sky upon your garden, so that it becomes a smooth, barren land on which no foot can stand and no plant can grow, or the water from which you water it will sink into the ground so that you are unable to extract it?

And what the believer said came true, and destruction befell the garden, and everything in it perished, so the disbeliever began to wring his hands in regret. And regret for what he spent on it while it was empty, some of it falling on top of others, and he says, “Oh, I wish I had known the blessings of God and His power and not associated anyone with Him.” This is regret from him when regret does not benefit him. And he did not have a group of those he boasted about to prevent him from the punishment of God that was coming upon him, and what he was able to protect himself and his strength from. In such hardships, the guardianship and support belong to God the Truth. He is the best reward and the best outcome for those of His believing servants who are guardians of them."
m-0600	And, O Messenger, give people, especially the arrogant among them, a description of the world that they are deceived by in its splendor and its quick disappearance. It is like water that God sends down from the sky, and with it plants grow by His permission and become green. But it is only a short time until this plant becomes dry and broken, blown away by the winds in every direction. And God is over all things competent. That is, He has great power over all things. Money and children are beauty and strength in this transient world, and righteous deeds, especially glorifying, praising, magnifying, and declaring God’s oneness are better rewarded by your Lord than money and children. These righteous deeds are the best reward that a person can hope for from his Lord, so that he will attain in the Hereafter what he hoped for in this world.
m-0601	And mention to them the Day when We will remove the mountains from their places and you will see the earth plainly, with nothing covering it from what was upon it of creations. And We will gather the first and the last for the place of reckoning, and We will not leave out a single one of them. And they will all be presented before your Lord in ranks, with none of them concealed. We have certainly sent you, and you have come to Us individually, with no wealth or children, just as We created you the first time. Rather, you thought that We would not make for you an appointment to resurrect you and recompense you for your deeds. And the book of deeds of each one will be placed in his right hand or in his left, so the disobedient will see, fearing what is in it because of the crimes they have committed. And they will say when they see it, “Oh, our destruction! What is this book that has not left out any small or great of our deeds except that it has recorded them?” And they will find everything they did in this world present and recorded. And your Lord does not wrong anyone by as much as an atom’s weight. So the obedient will not be diminished from his reward, nor will the disobedient be increased in his punishment.
m-0602	And remember when We commanded the angels to prostrate to Adam as a greeting to him, not as an act of worship, and We commanded Iblis as they were commanded, so all the angels prostrated, but Iblis, who was from the jinn, went out of arrogance and envy to obey his Lord. So will you, O people, make him and his offspring your helpers, that you obey them and abandon obedience to Me, while they are your fiercest enemies? How ugly is the obedience of the wrongdoers to Satan instead of obedience to the Most Gracious. I did not bring Iblis and his offspring, whom you obeyed, to create the heavens and the earth, so that I could seek their help in creating them, nor did I make some of them witnesses to the creation of others. Rather, I was unique in creating all of that, without any helper or supporter. And I would not have taken the misguiders from among the devils and others as helpers. So how can you divert My right to them and take them as allies instead of Me, while I am the Creator of all things? And remember to them when Allah will say to the polytheists on the Day of Resurrection, “Call upon My partners whom you claimed were My partners in worship, so that they may aid you today against Me.” But they sought help from them, but they did not aid them, and We placed them among the worshippers. And the worshipped ones will perish in Hell, where they will all perish. The criminals will see the Fire and will be certain that they will inevitably fall into it, and they will find no alternative to turning away from it to something else.
m-0603	"And We have made clear and diversified in this Qur’an for people many types of examples so that they may learn from them and believe. And man is the most contentious and argumentative of all creatures.

And what prevented people from believing when the Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, came to them with the Qur’an and the repentance of their Lord, seeking His pardon for them, was their challenge to the Messenger and their request that God’s way of destroying those who came before them befall them or that God’s punishment befall them clearly.

And We do not send messengers to people except to be bearers of good tidings of Paradise to the people of faith and righteous deeds and to frighten the people of disbelief and disobedience with the Fire. And despite the clarity of the truth, those who disbelieve argue with their messengers with falsehood, out of stubbornness, to remove with their falsehood the truth that the Messenger brought to them, and they take My Book and My proofs and the punishment with which they frightened as mockery and derision."
m-0604	And no one is more unjust than he who is admonished by the clear verses of his Lord, but turns away from them to his falsehood and forgets the ugly deeds his hands have done and does not turn back from them. Indeed, We have placed coverings over their hearts, so they did not understand the Qur’an or perceive what is good in it. And We have placed in their ears something resembling deafness, so they did not hear it or benefit from it. And if you call them to faith, they will not respond to you, nor will they be guided to it ever. And your Lord is the Forgiving of the sins of His servants, if they repent, the Possessor of mercy toward them. If He were to punish these people who turn away from His verses for what they have earned of sins and crimes, He would hasten the punishment for them. But He is Forbearing and does not hasten punishment. Rather, they have an appointed time in which they will be recompensed for their deeds. They have no escape from it or way out. And those towns near you, like the towns of the people of Hud, Salih, Lot, and Shuaib, We destroyed them when their people were unjust by disbelief. And We appointed for their destruction a time and a term. When they reached it, the punishment came to them, so Allah destroyed them thereby.
m-0605	"And remember when Moses said to his servant Joshua, son of Nun, I will continue to walk until I reach the confluence of the two seas, or I will walk a long time until I reach the righteous servant, so that I may learn from him what I do not have of knowledge.

They were exhausted in their journey, and when they reached the confluence of the two seas, they sat down by a rock and forgot their fish, which Moses had ordered to take with him as food for them, and Joshua carried it in a basket. Then the fish became alive and descended into the sea, making an open path for itself.

When they left the place where they had forgotten the fish, and Moses felt hungry, he said to his servant, “Bring us our lunch, for we have been exhausted by this journey of ours.”

His servant said to him, “Do you remember when we took refuge at the rock where we rested? I forgot to tell you what happened with the fish, and nothing made me forget to mention that to you except Satan, for the dead fish came to life and jumped into the sea and made a path for itself in it. His affair was something that I marvel at.”

Moses said, “What happened is what we were seeking, for it is a sign for me of the place of the righteous servant.” So they returned, recounting the traces of their walking until they reached The Rock

So they found there a righteous servant of Ours, Al-Khidr, peace be upon him, and he was a prophet of Allah. Allah took him. We gave him mercy from Us and taught him from Us a great knowledge.

So Moses greeted him and said to him, “Do you permit me to follow you so that you may teach me from the knowledge that Allah has taught you what I may be guided by and benefit from?”

Al-Khidr said to him, “O Moses, you will not be able to be patient in following me and sticking with me.”

How can you be patient with what I will do of things that are hidden from you of what Allah has taught me?

Moses said to him, “If Allah wills, you will find me patient with what I see from you and I will not disobey any order you command me to do.”

So Al-Khidr agreed and said to him, “If you accompany me, do not ask me about anything you do not know until I explain to you what is hidden from you without you asking me.”

So they set off walking on the shore. A ship passed by them and they asked its people to board with them. When they boarded, Al-Khidr tore a plank from the ship and tore it. Moses said to him, “You have ripped the ship to drown its people, and they have carried us without pay. You have done an evil thing.”

Al-Khidr said to him, “You have said From the beginning, you will not be able to be patient with my company. Moses said, apologizing, ""Do not hold me accountable for forgetting your condition, and do not burden me with learning from you, and treat me with ease and kindness."" So Al-Khidr accepted his apology, and they got out of the ship. While they were walking on the shore, they saw a boy playing with the boys, so Al-Khidr killed him. Moses denounced him and said, ""How did you kill a pure soul that has not reached the age of accountability? And you have not killed a soul that deserves to be killed for it? You have indeed committed a great evil."" Al-Khidr said to Moses, rebuking and reminding him, ""Did I not tell you that you would not be able to be patient with me over what you see of my actions, which you have no knowledge of?"" Moses said to him, ""If I ask you about anything after this time, leave me alone and do not befriend me. You have made an excuse for my situation, and you have not fallen short in telling me that I would not be able to be patient with you."" So Moses and Al-Khidr went until they came to the people of a village and asked them for food as a way of hospitality, but the people of the village refused to host them. They found a leaning wall in it that was about to collapse, so Al-Khidr adjusted its tilt until it was level. He said, Moses said to him, “If you wished, you would have taken a wage for this work and spent it on obtaining our food, since they did not host us.”"
m-0606	"Al-Khidr said to Moses, ""This is the time of separation between me and you. I will tell you about the actions that you have done and about which you could not bear to stop asking about them and denouncing me. As for the ship that you made a hole in, it belonged to poor people who worked on it at sea seeking a livelihood. I wanted to denounce it with that hole because before them was a king who took every good ship by force from its owners. As for the boy that you killed, he was in the knowledge of God a disbeliever, but his father and mother were believers. We feared that if the boy had remained alive, he would have led his parents to disbelief and tyranny because of their love for him or because of their need for him. So we wanted God to replace his parents with someone better than him in righteousness, religion, and kindness to them. As for the wall whose slope you adjusted until it was straight, it belonged to two orphan boys in the town where the wall was. There was a treasure of gold and silver beneath it for them, and their father was a righteous man. Your Lord intended that they should grow up and reach their strength and extract their treasure out of mercy from your Lord to them. And I did not do, O Moses, all that you saw me do of my own accord."" On my own initiative, and I did it on the command of God. That which I have explained to you the reasons for is the consequence of the matters about which you could not be patient enough to stop asking about them and denouncing me for them."
m-0607	"And these polytheists from your people ask you, O Messenger, about the story of Dhul-Qarnayn, the righteous king. Say to them, ""I will relate to you a story about him that you may remember and take heed from.""

We established him in the land and gave him from all things means and methods by which he could reach what he wanted of conquering cities and subduing enemies and other things.

So he took those means and methods with diligence and effort.

Until when Dhul-Qarnayn reached the setting of the sun, he found it in plain sight as if it were setting in a hot spring of black mud. And he found at its setting a people. We said, ""O Dhul-Qarnayn, either punish them by killing them or otherwise if they do not acknowledge the Oneness of God, or be kind to them and teach them guidance and show them the right path."" Dhul-Qarnayn said, ""As for he among them who wronged himself and disbelieved in his Lord, We will punish him in this world, then he will return to his Lord, and He will punish him with a great punishment in the fire of Hell.

As for he among them who believed in his Lord, believed in Him, made Him One, and acted in obedience to Him, he will have Paradise as a reward from God. And We will be kind to him and be gentle in speech to him and make his dealings easy for him.""

Then Dhul-Qarnayn returned to The East follows the reasons that God gave him"
m-0608	"Until when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people who had no building to cover them or trees to shade them from the sun.

Thus, Our knowledge encompassed what He had of goodness and great causes wherever he went and walked.

Then Dhul-Qarnayn walked, taking the paths and causes that We had given him.

Until when he reached the area between the two mountains that were blocking what was beyond them, he found beyond them a people who could hardly recognize the speech of anyone other than themselves.

They said, “O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog are two great nations among the children of Adam, who are corrupting the earth by destroying crops and livestock. Shall we then give you a reward and collect wealth for you on condition that you place a barrier between us and them?”

Dhul-Qarnayn said, “What my Lord has given me of kingship and power is better for me than your wealth, so help me with strength from you, and I will make a barrier between you and them.”

Give me pieces of iron. When they had brought it and placed it and leveled it with the two mountains, he said to the workers, “Stoke the fire.”

When all the iron had become fire, he said, “Give me copper that I may pour over it.”

So Gog and Magog were not able to They climbed over the dam because of its height and smoothness, and they were not able to dig it from below because of its great width and strength. Dhul-Qarnayn said, “This that I have built as a barrier against the corruption of Gog and Magog is a mercy from my Lord to mankind. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it level, crushed, level with the ground. And ever is the promise of my Lord true.”"
m-0609	"And We shall leave Gog and Magog on the Day when Our promise comes to them, they will surge against one another, mixed together because of their great multitude. And the trumpet will be blown for the Resurrection, and We will gather all of creation for the reckoning and recompense.

And We shall present Hell to the disbelievers and bring it out to them to show them the evil of their end.

Those whose eyes in this world were covered from My remembrance, so they did not see My signs, and they were unable to hear My arguments leading to faith in Me and My Messenger.

Do those who disbelieve in Me think that they will take My servants as gods other than Me to be their allies? Indeed, We have prepared the fire of Hell for the disbelievers as a dwelling.

Say, O Messenger, to the people, warning, “Shall We inform you of the people who are the greatest losers in their deeds?”

They are the ones whose deeds were lost in the life of this world, and they are the polytheists of your people, and others who have strayed from the right path, so they were not on guidance nor right, and they think that they are doing good in their deeds.

Those are the greatest losers in their deeds. They are the ones who denied the signs of their Lord and denied them and denied the meeting with Him on the Day of Resurrection. So their deeds will be worthless because of their disbelief, so We will not establish for them on the Day of Resurrection. The mentioned is the failure of their deeds. Their recompense is the fire of Hell because of their disbelief in God and their taking His signs and the arguments of His messengers as mockery and ridicule."
m-0610	Indeed, those who have believed in Me and believed in My messengers and done righteous deeds will have the highest and best abode in Paradise. They will abide therein forever, never wanting to leave it, out of their desire for it and their love for it.
m-0611	Say, O Messenger, if the water of the sea were ink for the pens with which the words of God are written, the water of the sea would be exhausted before the words of God were exhausted, even if We brought other seas like the sea as a supplement for it. And in this verse is proof of the true attribute of speech for God Almighty, as befits His majesty and perfection. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, I am only a human being like you, to whom it is revealed from my Lord that your God is only One God. So whoever fears the punishment of his Lord and hopes for his reward on the Day of Meeting Him, let him do righteous work for his Lord in accordance with His law, and let him not associate in worship with Him anyone other than Him.
m-0612	"Kaf Ha Ya Ain Sad We have already spoken about the disconnected letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

This is a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zachariah. We will relate it to you, for in that is a lesson for those who take heed

When he called upon his Lord secretly, so that he may be more perfect and complete in his sincerity to Allah and more hopeful of an answer

He said, ""My Lord, indeed I have grown old and my bones have weakened, and gray hair has spread over my head, and I have never before been deprived of an answer to my supplication

And indeed I feared my relatives and my clan after my death, lest they should not uphold Your religion with the right upholding and should not call Your servants to You. And my wife has been barren, so grant me from You a son who will be an inheritor and a helper

Who will inherit my prophethood and the prophethood of the family of Jacob, and make this son pleasing to You and to Your servants

O Zachariah, indeed We give you good tidings of the answer to your supplication. We have bestowed upon you a boy whose name is John. We have not given anyone before him this name

Zachariah said, astonished, ""My Lord, how can I have a son while my wife has been barren, so that I may not bear children, and I have reached the extremes of old age and weak bones?""

The king said, answering Zachariah to what he was astonished at, ""This is how it is."" You say that your wife is barren and you have reached old age, but your Lord said, “Creating John in this manner is an easy matter, simple for Me.” Then God Almighty mentioned to Zachariah something more amazing than what he asked about, saying, “And I created you before John, and you were nothing worth mentioning or existing.” Zachariah said, increasing his reassurance, “My Lord, make for me a sign of the fulfillment of what the angels gave me glad tidings of.” He said, “Your sign is that you will not be able to speak to people for a period of three nights and days, while you are sound and healthy.” Then Zachariah came out to his people from his place of prayer, which is the place where he had been given the good news of the son, and he motioned to them to glorify God morning and evening in thanks to Him Almighty."
m-0613	When Yahya was born and reached an age where he could understand the message, God commanded him to take the Torah seriously and diligently, saying, “O Yahya, take the Torah seriously and diligently by memorizing its words, understanding its meanings, and acting upon it.” And We gave him wisdom and good understanding while he was still young. And We bestowed upon him mercy and love from Us and purity from sins. He was fearful and obedient to God Almighty, fulfilling His obligations and avoiding His prohibitions. He was dutiful to his parents and obedient to them. He was not arrogant about obeying his Lord or his parents, nor disobedient to his Lord or his parents. And peace from God be upon Yahya and safety for him the day he was born, the day he dies, and the day he is raised from his grave alive.
m-0614	"And mention, O Messenger, in this Qur’an the story of Mary, when she distanced herself from her family and took a place towards the east from them. Then she made a screen for herself from her family to conceal her from them and from the people. Then We sent to her the angel Gabriel, and he appeared to her in the form of a perfect human being. Mary said to him, “Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Merciful from you, lest you should harm me, if you should be of those who fear Allah.” The angel said to her, “I am only a messenger from your Lord. He has sent me to you to give you a boy who is pure from sins.” Mary said to the king, “How can I have a boy when no man has touched me in lawful marriage, nor have I been an adulteress?” The angel said to her, “This is the matter as you describe, that no man has touched you, and you were not unchaste.” But your Lord said, “The matter is easy for Me.” And so that this boy would be a sign to the people, indicating the power of Allah Almighty and a mercy from Us to him, his mother, and the people. And the existence of Jesus in this state was a previous decree, predestined and written in the Preserved Tablet, so it must be carried out. So Mary became pregnant with the boy after Gabriel blew into the pocket of her shirt, and the blow reached her womb, and the pregnancy occurred because of that. So she went away with him to a place far from the people. Then the labor pains forced her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, “I wish I had died before this day and was something that is not known or remembered and whose identity is unknown.” Then Gabriel or Jesus called to her, “Do not grieve. Your Lord has placed beneath you a stream of water. Move the trunk of the palm tree and it will drop upon you fresh, ripe dates that will be picked immediately.” So eat from the dates and drink from the water and be content with the newborn. If you see anyone among the people and ask you about your situation, say to him, “I have made it obligatory for myself to remain silent before God, so I will not speak to anyone today.” Silence was an act of worship in their law, not in the law of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. Then Mary came to her people carrying her newborn from the distant place. When they saw her like this, they said to her, “O Mary, you have certainly done a great and fabricated matter. O sister of the righteous man Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, committing immoralities, nor was your mother a woman of evil, committing prostitution.” Then Mary pointed to her newborn Jesus so that they might ask him and speak to him. They said, denying her, “How can we speak to one who is still in Cradle him as a baby

Jesus said while he was nursing in his cradle, “I am the servant of God. He has decreed that I be given the Book, which is the Gospel, and made me a prophet.

He has made me of great goodness and benefit wherever I am found, and has enjoined upon me the maintenance of prayer and the giving of zakat as long as I remain alive.

He has made me dutiful to my mother, and has not made me arrogant or miserable, disobedient to my Lord.

And safety and security are upon me from God the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I am raised alive on the Day of Resurrection."
m-0615	That which We have related to you, O Messenger, his description and story is Jesus, son of Mary, without doubt or uncertainty. Rather, it is the statement of the truth about which the Jews and Christians doubted. It is not for God Almighty, nor is it befitting for Him to take from among His servants and creation a son. He is far removed and sanctified from that. When He decrees a matter and wills it, small or large, He does not prevent it. Rather, He says to it, “Be,” and it is as He wills and wills it. And Jesus said to his people, “Indeed, God, to whom I call you, is alone my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him alone, with no partner for Him. So I and you are equal in servitude and submission to Him. This is the path in which there is no crookedness.” So the sects of the People of the Book differed among themselves regarding the matter of Jesus, peace be upon him. Some of them, the Christians, went to extremes in it. Some of them said, “He is God,” and some of them said, “He is the son of God,” and some of them said, “He is the third of three.” God is exalted above what they say. Some of them, the Jews, said, “He is a magician,” and they said, “The son of Joseph the carpenter.” So destruction be upon those who disbelieve, witnesses of a Day of Great Terror, which is the Day of Resurrection. How sharp their hearing and sight will be on the Day of Resurrection, the Day when they will come before God when that will not benefit them. But the wrongdoers today are in this The world is in a state of disintegration from the truth. And warn the people, O Messenger, of the Day of Regret when the matter is decided and death is brought like a white ram and is slaughtered and the creation is separated. The people of faith go to Paradise and the people of disbelief go to Hell. Today, in this world, they are heedless of what they were warned about. They do not believe and do not do righteous deeds. Indeed, We are the inheritors of the earth and those on it, with their demise and our survival after them and our judgment over them. To Us is their return and their reckoning, so We will reward them for their deeds.
m-0616	"And mention, O Messenger, to your people in this Qur’an the story of Abraham, peace be upon him. He was a man of great truthfulness and one of the highest status among the prophets of God Almighty. When he said to his father Azar, “O my father, why do you worship idols that do not hear or see or protect you from anything other than God?” O my father, God has given me knowledge that He has not given you, so accept from me and follow me to what I call you to. I will guide you to the right path in which you will not go astray. O my father, do not obey Satan and worship these idols. Indeed, Satan has been disobedient to the Most Merciful, arrogant about obeying God. O my father, I fear that you will die in your disbelief and a punishment from the Most Merciful will afflict you, and you will be a companion to Satan in the Fire. The father of Abraham said to his son, “Are you turning away from worshipping my gods, O Abraham? If you do not stop cursing them, I will kill you by stoning you. Go away from me and do not meet me or speak to me for a long time.” Abraham said to his father, “Peace be upon you from me, so that nothing you dislike will happen to you from me. I will pray to God for you.” With guidance and forgiveness, my Lord is Most Merciful, Most Compassionate with my condition. He answers me when I call upon Him.

And I will leave you and your gods which you worship besides God, and I will call upon my Lord sincerely. Perhaps I will not be miserable by calling upon my Lord, so that He will not give me what I ask of Him.

So when he left them and their gods which they worship besides God, We gave him of the sons Isaac and Jacob, the son of Isaac, and We made them both prophets.

And We bestowed upon them all from Our mercy an incalculable bounty, and We made for them a good mention and beautiful praise lasting among the people."
m-0617	"And remember, O Messenger, in the Qur’an the story of Moses, peace be upon him. He was the chosen one, and he was a Messenger, a Prophet, from among the resolute Messengers.

And We called to Moses from the right side of Mount Sinai, from Moses, and brought him near, and honored him with Our communion with him. In this is the confirmation of the attribute of speech for God Almighty, as befits His Majesty and Perfection.

And We bestowed upon Moses, from Our mercy, his brother Aaron, a Prophet who supported and aided him.

And remember, O Messenger, in this Qur’an the story of Ishmael, peace be upon him. He was truthful in his promise, and he did not promise anything without fulfilling it. He was a Messenger, a Prophet.

And he used to command his family to establish prayer and give zakat, and he was pleasing to his Lord, the Almighty and Majestic.

And remember, O Messenger, in this Qur’an the story of Idris, peace be upon him. He was very truthful in his words and deeds, a Prophet to whom revelation was sent.

And We raised his mention among the worlds and his status among those brought near, so he was of high mention and high status.

These are the ones whose story I have told you, O Messenger, are those upon whom God bestowed His grace and guidance, and He made them Prophets from the descendants of Adam and from the descendants of We carried with Noah in the ark, and some of the descendants of Abraham and some of the descendants of Jacob, and those whom We guided to faith and chose for the message and prophethood. When the verses of the Most Gracious, which include His oneness and His proofs, were recited to them, they fell down in prostration to God in submission and humility, and they wept out of fear of Him, glory be to Him, the Most High."
m-0618	"Then came after those who were blessed, evil followers who abandoned the prayer entirely or missed its time or neglected its pillars and obligations and followed what agreed with their desires and suited them, so they will encounter evil, misguidance and disappointment in Hell. But whoever among them repents from his sin and believes in his Lord and does righteous deeds in confirmation of his repentance, then those are those whose repentance Allah will accept and they will enter Paradise with the believers and nothing will be diminished from their righteous deeds.

Eternal gardens and a permanent residence, which the Most Gracious promised to His servants in the unseen, so they believed in it and did not see it. Indeed, Allah’s promise to His servants of this Paradise will surely come true.

The people of Paradise will not hear any vain talk therein, but they will hear “Peace” as a greeting to them, and they will have their provision therein of food and drink always whenever they wish, morning and evening.

That Paradise described with those attributes is the one that We inherit and give to Our servants who fear Us by obeying Our commands and avoiding Our prohibitions.

And say, O Gabriel, to Muhammad, “We the angels do not descend from the heaven to the earth except by the command of your Lord. To Him belongs what is before us of what is to come of The matter of the Hereafter and what has passed from this world and what is between this world and the Hereafter, for His is the whole matter in time and place, and your Lord is not forgetful of anything of the things. He is God, Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and the Owner of all of that, its Creator and its Manager. So worship Him alone, O Prophet, and be patient in obeying Him, you and those who follow you. There is nothing like Him in His essence, names, attributes, and actions."
m-0619	"And the disbelieving man says, denying the resurrection after death, ""When I die and perish, will I then emerge from my grave alive?"" How did this disbelieving man forget himself? Or does he remember that We created him the first time, when he was nothing? By your Lord, O Messenger, We will surely gather these disbelievers in the resurrection on the Day of Resurrection with the devils. Then We will bring them all around Hell, kneeling on their knees, because of the intensity of the terror they are in, unable to stand. Then We will take from every group the most rebellious and disobedient of them, and We will begin with their punishment. Then We know best who is most deserving of entering the Fire and enduring its heat. There is not one of you, O people, except that he will enter the Fire by passing over the bridge set up on the back of Hell, each according to his deeds. That was an inevitable matter that Allah, the Most High, has decreed and ruled that it must inevitably occur. Then We will save those who feared their Lord by obeying Him and avoiding disobeying Him, and We will leave the wrongdoers to themselves by disbelieving in Allah in the Fire, kneeling on their knees."
m-0620	"And when Our clear revelations are recited to the people, the disbelievers in Allah say to the believers, ""Which of the two parties, us and you, is better in station and better in assembly?""

And many before the disbelievers of your people, O Messenger, We destroyed, O Messenger, of the nations who were better in provision than them and more beautiful in appearance.

Say, O Messenger, to them, ""Whoever is astray from the truth and does not follow the path of guidance, Allah will grant him respite and will grant him respite in his error until he sees for certain what Allah has threatened him with, either the immediate punishment in this world or the establishment of the Hour. Then he will know who is worse in position and settlement and weaker in strength and troops.

And Allah increases His servants who are guided to His religion in guidance upon their guidance by what they renew of faith in the obligations of Allah and acting upon them and the lasting righteous deeds, which are better in reward with Allah in the Hereafter and better in return and outcome."
m-0621	"Did you know, O Messenger, and wonder at this disbeliever Al-Aas bin Wael and his likes when he disbelieved in the signs of Allah and denied them and said, “I will certainly be given wealth and children in the Hereafter?”

He looked into the unseen and saw that he had wealth and children, or did he have a covenant with Allah about that?

The matter is not as that disbeliever claims, for he has no knowledge and no covenant with Allah. We will record what he says of lies and slander against Allah and will increase for him in the Hereafter from various types of punishments as he increased in error and misguidance.

And we will inherit his wealth and children from him, and he will come to Us on the Day of Resurrection alone, with no wealth or children.

And the polytheists took gods to worship besides Allah to support them and to be proud of them.

The matter is not as they claim, the gods will not be a source of pride for them, but these gods will disbelieve in the Hereafter because of their worship of them and will be helpers against them in their dispute and denial, contrary to what they thought about them.

Did you not see, O Messenger, that We have given power to the devils over the disbelievers in Allah and His Messengers to mislead them and push them away from obedience to disobedience.

So do not rush, O Messenger, to seek punishment for these people. The unbelievers, We only count their ages and their deeds with a count in which there is no neglect or delay.

The Day We shall gather the righteous to their Lord, the Most Merciful, in honored delegations. And We shall drive the unbelievers to the Fire, walking, thirsty.

The Day We shall gather the righteous to their Lord, the Most Merciful, in honored delegations. And We shall drive the unbelievers to the Fire, walking, thirsty.

These unbelievers do not have the right to intercede for anyone. It is only those who have made a covenant with the Most Merciful that they may do so. They are the believers in God and His messengers."
m-0622	"And these disbelievers said, ""The Most Gracious has taken a son."" You who say this statement have certainly come up with something terrible and reprehensible. The heavens almost split apart from the horror of that statement, and the earth cracks and the mountains fall violently, in anger at Allah for attributing a son to Him. Exalted is Allah far above that.

The heavens almost split apart from the horror of that statement, and the earth cracks and the mountains fall violently, in anger at Allah for attributing a son to Him. Exalted is Allah far above that.

It is not appropriate for the Most Gracious, nor does it befit His greatness, to take a son, because taking a son indicates deficiency and need, and Allah is the Rich, the Praiseworthy, the Exalted from all deficiencies.

There is none in the heavens, from the angels, and on the earth, from mankind and jinn, but that he will come to his Lord on the Day of Resurrection as a humble and submissive slave, acknowledging his servitude to Him.

Allah, the Most High, has counted all of His creation and knows their number, so none of them is hidden from Him.

And every individual from creation will come to his Lord on the Day of Resurrection alone, with no wealth or children with him."
m-0623	"Those who believe in Allah and follow His messengers and do righteous deeds in accordance with His law - the Most Merciful will make for them love and affection in the hearts of His servants.

We have only made this Qur’an easy for you, O Messenger, in your Arabic language so that you may give good tidings to the righteous among your followers and warn with it the deniers who are fierce in their falsehood.

And many, O Messenger, have We destroyed from the previous nations before your people. You do not see a single one of them nor do you hear their voice. So will We destroy the disbelievers among your people, just as We destroyed those who came before them. In this is a threat and a warning to destroy the stubborn deniers."
m-0624	"Taha We have previously discussed the disconnected letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

We have not sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an to make you miserable through work that you have no ability to do

But We have sent it down as an admonition so that whoever fears the punishment of Allah may remember and guard against it by performing the obligatory duties and avoiding the forbidden

This Qur’an is a revelation from Allah, Who created the earth and the high heavens

The Most Gracious is established on the Throne, that is, He rose and ascended in a manner befitting His majesty and greatness

To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever is between them and whatever is under the earth in creation, dominion, and management

And if you, O Messenger, speak aloud, announcing it or keeping it quiet, then nothing is hidden from Allah. He knows the secret and what is more hidden than the secret of what your soul speaks about

Allah, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, to Him alone belong the perfect names in beauty"
m-0625	"And has there reached you, O Messenger, the news of Moses, son of Imran, peace be upon him?

When he saw a burning fire at night, he said to his family, ""Wait, I have seen a fire. Perhaps I can bring you a torch from it to warm you and kindle another fire with it, or I can find a guide near it to show us the way.""

So when Moses came to that fire, God called to him, ""O Moses, I am your Lord, so take off your shoes. You are now in the valley of Tuwa, which I have blessed."" This was in preparation for communing with his Lord.

And I have chosen you, O Moses, for My message, so listen to what is revealed to you from Me.

I am God, there is no true deity except Me, I have no partner, so worship Me alone and establish prayer in order to remember Me therein.

The Hour in which people will be resurrected is coming. It must happen. I almost hide it from myself, but how can any of the creatures know it? So that every soul may be rewarded for what it has done in this world, whether good or evil.

So do not let them turn you away, O Moses. About believing in it and preparing for it, whoever does not believe in its occurrence and does not work for it and follows his own desires and denies it, then he will perish."
m-0626	"What is this in your right hand, O Moses? Moses said, ""It is my staff, which I rely on to walk and shake the trees with it to graze my sheep when their leaves fall, and I have other benefits in it."" God said to Moses, ""Throw down your staff."" So Moses threw it on the ground and it turned, by God's permission, into a serpent, darting about. Moses saw a great thing and turned away fleeing. God said to Moses, ""Take the serpent and do not be afraid of it. We will restore it to a staff as it was in its first state. And put your hand to your side under your armpit. It will come out white like snow, without leprosy, so that you will have another sign."" God said to Moses, ""Take the serpent and do not be afraid of it. We will restore it to a staff as it was in its first state. And put your hand to your side under your armpit. It will come out white like snow, without leprosy, so that you will have another sign."" We did this to show you, O Moses, from Our greatest proofs, which indicate Our power, the greatness of Our authority, and the truth of your message. Go, O Moses, to Pharaoh. He has transgressed his limits and rebelled against his Lord. So call him to the Oneness of God and His worship."
m-0627	"Moses said: My Lord, expand for me my chest and make my task easy for me and loose my tongue with eloquent speech that they may understand my speech. And appoint for me a helper from among my family, Aaron, my brother. Strengthen me through him and strengthen my back through him.

m-0628	"And that is when We inspired your mother to put your son Moses after his birth in the chest then throw him into the Nile, and the Nile will cast him upon the shore, and Pharaoh, My enemy and his enemy, will take him. And I bestowed upon you love from Me, so you became beloved among the servants, and that you may be raised before My eyes and in My protection. And in the verse is proof of the attribute of the eye for Allah, the Most High, as befits His majesty and perfection. ... your sister walks, following you, then she says to those who took you, “Shall I direct you to someone who will take care of him and nurse him for you?” So We returned you to your mother after you had become in the hands of Pharaoh, so that she may be content with your safety from drowning and killing, and not grieve over your loss. And you killed the man. Coptic Error So We saved you from the grief of your action and the fear of being killed, and We tested you with a test, so you went out in fear to the people of Midian, and you remained among them for years, then you came from Midian at the time that We had determined for sending you, a coming in accordance with the decree and will of God, and the matter is entirely for God, the Blessed and Most High.
And I bestowed upon you, O Moses, these blessings as a selection from Me for you and a choice for My message and to convey from Me and to carry out My commands and prohibitions.
Go, O Moses, you and your brother Aaron with My signs that indicate My divinity and the perfection of My power and the truth of your message, and do not weaken from constantly remembering Me. Go together to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed the limit in disbelief and injustice. So speak to him with gentle words that perhaps he will remember or fear his Lord ... And your brother Aaron, with My signs that indicate My divinity and the perfection of My power and the truth of your message, and do not weaken in constantly remembering Me. Go together to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed the limit in disbelief and injustice, so speak to him with gentle words that perhaps he will remember or fear his Lord. Moses and Aaron said, “Our Lord, indeed we fear that he will hasten the punishment upon us or that he will rebel against the truth and not accept it.” God said to Moses and Aaron, “Do not fear Pharaoh, for I am with you, I hear your words and I see your actions. So go to him and say to him, ‘We are messengers to you from your Lord, that you release the Children of Israel and do not impose on them what they cannot bear of work. We have come to you with a miraculous sign from your Lord that indicates our truthfulness in our call and safety from the punishment of God Almighty for those who follow His guidance.

m-0629	"Pharaoh said to them, ""Who is your Lord, O Moses?"" Moses said to him, ""Our Lord is He who gave everything its form that befits it, in accordance with its good creation, and then guided every creature to benefit from what God created for it."" Pharaoh said to Moses, ""What is the matter with the previous nations and what is the news of the past generations? They preceded us in denial and disbelief."" Moses said to Pharaoh, ""The knowledge of those generations in what they did of that is with my Lord in the Preserved Tablet, and I have no knowledge of it. My Lord does not err in His actions and judgments, nor does He forget anything of what He taught Him of them."" It is He who made the earth easy for you to benefit from it, and made for you many paths in it, and sent down from the sky rain, and thereby brought forth various kinds of vegetation. ""Eat, O people, from the good things that We have grown for you, and pasture your animals and your cattle. Indeed, in all that has been mentioned are signs of God's power and a call to His Oneness and to worship Him alone for those with sound minds."" From the earth We created you, O people, and into it We will return you after death, and from it We will bring you out alive once again for the reckoning and reward."
m-0630	"And We showed Pharaoh all Our proofs and arguments that prove Our divinity and power and the truth of the message of Moses, but he denied them and refused to accept the truth.

Pharaoh said, ""O Moses, have you come to us to drive us out of our homes with this magic of yours?""

We will come to you with magic like your magic, so make an appointment between us and you that we will not break and you will not break it, in a level, moderate place between us and you.

Moses said to Pharaoh, ""Your appointment for the meeting is on the day of the festival when the people adorn themselves and gather from every direction at the time of the forenoon.""

So Pharaoh turned away, ignoring what Moses had brought him of the truth, so he gathered his magicians and then came after that to the appointed time for the meeting.

Moses said to Pharaoh's magicians, admonishing them, ""Beware! Do not invent a lie against Allah, lest He uproot you with a punishment from Himself and destroy you. And he has lost who invents a lie against Allah.""

So the magicians discussed their affair among themselves and conversed secretly. They said, ""Indeed, Moses and Aaron are magicians who want to drive you out of your country with their magic and do away with the great magic method that you are following. So perfect your plot."" And resolve to do it without any disagreement among you, then come in one row and throw down what is in your hands at once to dazzle the eyes and overcome the magic of Moses and his brother, who has achieved his need today from the one who has risen above his companion, so he has overcome him and subdued him.

So the magicians discussed their affair among themselves and conversed secretly.

The magicians said, O Moses, either throw your staff first, or we will start and throw what we have. Moses said to them, Rather, throw what you have first. So they threw their ropes and staffs. Moses imagined from the strength of their magic that they were crawling serpents, so Moses felt fear in himself. Moses said to them, Rather, throw what you have first. So they threw their ropes and staffs. Moses imagined from the strength of their magic that they were crawling serpents, so Moses felt fear in himself. God said to Moses then, Do not fear anything, for you are the highest over these magicians and over Pharaoh and his soldiers, and you will overcome them. And throw down your staff that is in your right hand, and it will swallow their ropes and staffs. What they did before you was nothing but a magician’s trick and a magician’s imagination. The magician will not succeed with his magic, wherever he was."
m-0631	Then Moses threw down his staff, and it swallowed up what they had made. So the truth appeared and the argument was established against them. Then the magicians threw themselves on the ground in prostration and said, “We believe in the Lord of Aaron and Moses. If this had been magic, it would not have defeated us.” Pharaoh said to the magicians, “You believed in Moses and followed him and acknowledged him before I gave you permission to do so. Indeed, Moses is the greatest among you who taught you magic. Therefore, you followed him. So I will surely cut off your hands and feet, making them inconsistent with one hand on one side and one foot on the other. And I will crucify you by tying your bodies to the trunks of palm trees. And you will know, O magicians, which of us, I or the Lord of Moses, is more severe in punishment and more lasting.” The magicians said to Pharaoh, “We will not prefer you to obey you and follow your religion over what Moses brought us of clear proofs indicating his truthfulness and the necessity of following him and obeying his Lord. We will not prefer your alleged lordship over the lordship of God who created us. So do what you will do to us. Your authority is only in this worldly life, and what you do to us is nothing but a punishment that ends when it ends.” Indeed, we have believed in our Lord. And we believed in His Messenger and did what he brought so that our Lord might pardon our sins and what you forced us to do of practicing magic in opposition to Moses. And God is better for us than you, O Pharaoh, as a reward for those who obeyed Him, and He has left a lasting punishment for those who disobeyed Him and went against His command. Whoever comes to his Lord as a disbeliever in Him, for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he will be tormented. He will neither die therein nor find rest, nor will he live a life that he will enjoy. Whoever comes to his Lord as a believer in Him, having done righteous deeds, will have lofty mansions in the Gardens of Eternal Residence, beneath whose trees rivers flow, abiding therein forever. That is the everlasting bliss, a reward from God for whoever purifies himself from filth, evil, and polytheism, and worships God alone, obeys Him, avoids His disobedience, and meets his Lord, not associating any of His creation with Him in His worship ... He associates any of His creation with Him in His worship.
m-0632	"And We inspired Moses, ""Go forth by night with My servants from among the Children of Israel from Egypt, and take for them a dry path through the sea. Do not fear Pharaoh and his soldiers that they will overtake you, nor fear drowning in the sea."" So Moses took the Children of Israel by night and crossed with them a path through the sea. Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and they were overwhelmed by water the extent of which none knows except God. They were all drowned, and Moses and his people were saved. Pharaoh misled his people by making disbelief and denial seem attractive to them, and he did not guide them to the path of guidance."
m-0633	O Children of Israel, remember when We delivered you from your enemy Pharaoh and appointed your meeting place at the right side of Mount Tur to send down the Torah to you. And We sent down to you in the wilderness that which you eat of something like gum, its taste is like honey, and birds that resemble quail. Eat of Our good provision and do not transgress therein by wronging one another, lest My wrath should descend upon you. And he upon whom My wrath descends has certainly perished and lost. And indeed, I am Forgiving to him who repents from his sin and disbelief and believes in Me and does righteous deeds, then is guided to the truth and steadfast upon it.
m-0634	And what made you hasten away from your people, O Moses, that you outran them to the right side of the Mount and left them behind you? He said, “They are behind me; they will catch up with me, and I outran them to You, O my Lord, so that You may be more pleased with Me.” God said to Moses, “We have indeed tested your people after you left them with the worship of the calf, and the Samaritan has led them astray.”
m-0635	"Then Moses returned to his people, angry with them and sad, and said to them, “O my people, did not your Lord promise you a good promise by sending down the Torah? Has the covenant been long with you and you have been impatient for the promise? Or did you want to do something that would bring down the wrath of your Lord upon you? So you broke your promise to Me and worshipped the calf and abandoned adhering to My commands.” They said, “O Moses, we did not break your promise by our own choice, but we carried heavy loads of the jewelry of Pharaoh’s people and threw them into a pit of fire by the command of the Samaritan. Thus did the Samaritan throw away what he had of the dust of Gabriel’s horse’s hoof. So the Samaritan made for the Children of Israel a calf out of gold that mooed like a cow. Those who were infatuated with it said to others, “This is your god, and the god of Moses has forgotten it and neglected it.” Do not those who worshipped the calf see that it does not speak to them at first, nor does it respond to them, nor is it able to ward off harm from them or bring them any benefit? And Aaron had already said to the Children of Israel before Moses returned to them, “O my people, you are only being tested by this calf to distinguish the believer from the disbeliever. And your Lord is the Most Merciful.” No one else, so follow me in what I call you to of worshipping Allah and obey my command in following His law.

The worshippers of the calf among them said, ""We will continue to worship the calf until Moses returns to us.""

Moses said to his brother Aaron, ""What prevented you when you saw them straying from their religion from not following me and joining me and leaving them? Did you disobey my command in what I commanded you to do regarding my succession and reform after me?""

Moses said to his brother Aaron, ""What prevented you when you saw them straying from their religion from not following me and joining me and leaving them? Did you disobey my command in what I commanded you to do regarding my succession and reform after me?""

Then Moses took hold of Aaron's beard and head, pulling him towards him. Aaron said to him, ""O son of my mother, do not hold on to my beard or the hair of my head. I feared that if I left them and joined you, you would say, 'You have divided the Children of Israel and have not kept my command to take good care of them.'"""
m-0636	"Moses said to the Samaritan, ""What is the matter with you, Samaritan, and what prompted you to do what you did?"" The Samaritan said, ""I saw what they did not see, which was Gabriel, peace be upon him, on a horse at the time they came out of the sea and Pharaoh and his soldiers were drowning. So I took in my hand some dirt from the hoof print of Gabriel's horse and threw it on the jewelry from which I had made the calf. It was a calf with a body that mooed, a test and a trial. And thus my soul, which commands evil, made this deed seem good to me."" Moses said to the Samaritan, ""Go, for in your life you will live as an outcast, saying to everyone, 'No yesterday, no yesterday.' And you have an appointment for your torment and punishment, which God will not fail you in. You will meet him, and look at your god whom you worshipped. We will burn him in the fire, then we will scatter him in the sea, scattering him."" Your god, O people, is God, there is no god in truth except Him. His knowledge encompasses all things."
m-0637	"As We have related to you, O Messenger, the news of Moses and Pharaoh and their people, We inform you of the news of those who preceded you. And We have given you from Us this Qur’an as a reminder for whoever remembers. Whoever turns away from this Qur’an and does not believe in it or act according to what is in it, then he will come to his Lord on the Day of Resurrection bearing a great sin. 

Immortal in torment, and that heavy burden of sins will displease them as it will lead them to the Fire."
m-0638	"The Day the King will blow the trumpet for the shout of resurrection, and We will drive the disbelievers. That is the Day, and they will be blue-eyed, their colors and eyes will have changed from the intensity of the events and the horrors. They will whisper among themselves, saying to one another, “You have not remained in the life of this world except ten days.” We know best what they say, and they will whisper when the most knowledgeable and most intelligent of them will say, “You have not remained except one day.” The short duration of this world is in their minds on the Day of Resurrection. And your people will ask you, O Messenger, about the fate of the mountains on the Day of Resurrection. So say to them, “My Lord will remove them from their places and make them scattered dust.” Then the earth will be left flat, level, and smooth, with no vegetation in it. The observer will not see any inclination, elevation, or depression in its levelness. On that Day, people will follow the voice of the caller to the place of Resurrection. There is no escape from the call of the caller, because it is true and honest for all creation. The voices will be still in submission to the Most Merciful, so you will hear nothing from them except a faint voice. On that Day, intercession will not benefit anyone. From creation unless the Most Gracious permits the intercessor and is pleased with the one for whom intercession is made, and this is only for the sincere believer.

Allah knows what is before people of the matter of the Resurrection and what is behind them of the matter of this world, and His creation does not encompass it with knowledge, glory be to Him, the Most High.

And the faces of creation are humbled and submissive to their Creator, who has all the meanings of perfect life, as befits His Majesty, who does not die, who is in charge of managing everything, who is independent of anyone other than Him. And on the Day of Resurrection, he will lose whoever associates anyone of His creation with Allah.

And whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer in his Lord, he will not fear injustice by increasing his bad deeds, nor diminishment by decreasing his good deeds.

And just as We have encouraged the people of faith to do righteous deeds and warned the people of disbelief from continuing in their sins and disbelief in Our verses, We have sent down this Qur’an in the Arabic language so that they may understand it, and We have detailed in it types of threats, hoping that they will fear their Lord or that this Qur’an will cause them to be reminded, so that they may learn a lesson and take heed."
m-0639	So God Almighty is far removed, exalted and sanctified from all deficiency, the King whose authority has subdued every king and the Almighty who controls everything, who is true and whose promise is true and whose threat is true and everything from Him is true. And do not rush, O Messenger, to compete with Gabriel in reciting the Qur’an before he finishes it, and say, “My Lord, increase me in knowledge in addition to what You have taught me.”
m-0640	"And We had already enjoined upon Adam before he ate from the tree not to eat from it, and We said to him, ""Satan is an enemy to you and to your wife, so do not let him expel you from Paradise, lest you and your wife be miserable in this world."" Satan whispered to him, so he obeyed him, and Adam forgot the enjoinment, and We did not find in him the strength of resolve to preserve what he was commanded.

And remember, O Messenger, when We said to the angels, ""Prostrate to Adam, a prostration of greeting and honor."" So they obeyed and prostrated, but Satan refused to prostrate.

So We said, ""O Adam, this Satan is an enemy to you and your wife, so beware of him and do not obey him in disobeying Me, lest he expel you from Paradise, lest you be miserable when you are expelled from it.""

O Adam, in this Paradise you will eat and not be hungry, and you will be clothed and not be naked.

And you will not be thirsty in this Paradise, nor will the heat of the sun touch you.

So Satan whispered to Adam and said to him, ""Shall I direct you to a tree from which, if you eat, you will live forever, and you will not die, and you will have a kingdom that will not end or cease?""

So Adam and Eve ate from the tree that God had forbidden them from, and their private parts were exposed to them and it was hidden from their eyes, so they took They would tear off the leaves of the trees of Paradise and stick them on themselves to cover their nakedness. Adam disobeyed his Lord’s command and was led astray by eating from the tree that God had forbidden him to approach. Then God chose Adam, brought him close, accepted his repentance, and guided him to the right path."
m-0641	"Allah the Almighty said to Adam and Eve, ""Descend from Paradise to the earth, both of you, with Iblis. You and he are enemies. If there comes to you guidance and clarification from Me, then whoever follows My guidance and clarification and acts upon them, then he will be guided in this world and will be guided, and he will not be miserable in the Hereafter by the punishment of Allah."" 

And whoever turns away from My remembrance by which I remind him, then he will have a narrow and difficult life in this life, even if he appears to be among the people of virtue and wealth. His grave will be narrow for him, and he will be tormented in it, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind to vision and to argument. 

The one who turns away from the remembrance of Allah will say, ""My Lord, why have You gathered me blind, while I was seeing in this world?"" 

Allah the Almighty said to him, ""I have gathered you blind because My clear signs came to you, but you turned away from them and did not believe in them. Just as you abandoned them in this world, so today you will be left in the Fire."" 

And thus We punish those who transgressed against themselves, disobeyed their Lord and did not believe in His signs, with punishments in this world, but the punishment of the Hereafter prepared for them is more painful, more lasting, and more permanent, because it does not cease or end."
m-0642	Did not your people, O Messenger, show the path of guidance to the multitude of nations of disbelievers whom We destroyed before them, while they were walking in their homes and seeing the traces of their destruction? Indeed, in the multitude of those nations and the traces of their punishment are lessons and admonitions for people of conscious minds. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord and a specified term with Him, destruction would have befallen them soon, because they deserved it because of their disbelief. So, O Messenger, be patient with what those who disbelieve in you say of descriptions and falsehoods, and glorify your Lord with praise in the dawn prayer before sunrise, and the afternoon prayer before sunset, and the evening prayer during the hours of the night, and the noon and sunset prayers at the ends of the day, so that you may be rewarded for these deeds with what pleases you. And do not look at the types of enjoyments that We have given to these polytheists and their likes, for they are a fleeting adornment in this worldly life, which We have given them to test them with, and the provision and reward of your Lord is better for you than what We have given them to enjoy, and more lasting, as it has no interruption or exhaustion. And, O Prophet, command your people to pray and be patient in performing it. We do not ask you for what We have not given you. And We give you the good end in this world and the Hereafter for the people of piety.
m-0643	"And those who deny you will say, ""O Messenger, why do you not bring us a sign from your Lord that will show your truthfulness?"" Has there not come to them this Qur'an confirming what was in the previous scriptures of truth?

And if We had destroyed these deniers with a punishment before We sent to them a messenger and sent down to them a book, they would have said, ""Our Lord, why did You not send to us a messenger from You so that we might believe in him and follow Your verses and Your law before we were humiliated and disgraced by Your punishment?""

Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, ""Each one of us and you is waiting for the circles of time and for whom will be victory and success, so wait and you will know who is on the straight path and who is guided to the truth from among us and you."""
m-0644	"The time of reckoning for the people for what they have done has drawn near, yet the disbelievers live heedless of this truth, turning away from this warning. Nothing is revealed from the Qur’an that is recited to them again as a reminder, except that their listening to it is a play and mockery. Their hearts are heedless of the Noble Qur’an, preoccupied with the vanities and desires of this world, not understanding what is in it. Rather, the oppressors of Quraysh have gathered together on a hidden matter, which is to spread what they can use to turn people away from believing in Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he is a human being like them, no different from them in anything, and that what he brought from the Qur’an is magic. So how can you come to him and follow him while you see that he is a human being like you? The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, referred the matter to his Lord, the Most High, and said, “My Lord knows what is said in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you conceal of your speech. He is the Hearer of your words, the Knower of your conditions.” In this is a threat and warning to them. Rather, the disbelievers have denied the Qur’an. Some say that it is a mixture of dreams that have no reality, some say that it is fabrication and lies and not revelation, and some say that Muhammad is a poet and that what he brought is poetry, even though… He wanted us to believe him, so let him bring us a tangible miracle like the she-camel of Salih and the signs of Moses and Jesus and what the messengers before him brought.

No village believed before the infidels of Mecca, whose people asked for miracles from their messenger and they were fulfilled. Rather, they denied, so We destroyed them. Will the infidels of Mecca believe when the miracles they asked for are fulfilled? No, they do not believe.

And We did not send before you, O Messenger, except men from among mankind to whom We revealed. And We did not send angels. So ask, O infidels of Mecca, the people of knowledge about the previous revealed books if you are ignorant of that.

And We did not make those messengers before you outside the nature of mankind, not needing food and drink, nor were they immortal, not dying.

Then We fulfilled for the prophets and their followers what We promised them of victory and salvation, and We destroyed those who transgressed against themselves by their disbelief in their Lord.

We have certainly sent down to you this Qur’an, in which is your honor and glory in this world and the Hereafter. If you remember by it, will you not understand that by which We have preferred you over others?"
m-0645	"And many a town was wronged by their disbelief in what their messengers brought them, so We destroyed them with a punishment that annihilated them all, and We created after them another people besides them.

So when these wrongdoers saw Our severe punishment descending upon them and witnessed its signs, at once they hastened from their town, fleeing.

So they were called out in this state, ""Do not flee, but return to your pleasures and enjoyments in your distracting world and your lofty dwellings, that you may ask for something from your world,"" in a mocking and derisive manner.

So they had no answer except to admit their crime and say, ""Oh, our destruction! We have wronged ourselves by our disbelief.""

And that statement, which is a call to destroy themselves and an admission of injustice, their call continued to be repeated until We made them like harvested crops, dormant, with no life in them. So beware, O you who are being addressed, lest you continue to deny Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, lest what happened to the nations before you befall you."
m-0646	And We did not create the heaven and the earth and what is between them in vain and in vain, but rather to establish the argument against you, O people, and so that you may take heed from all of this and learn that the One Who created this, nothing resembles Him, and worship is not appropriate except for Him. If We had wanted to take a diversion from a son or a wife, We would have taken it from Us, not from you. We would not have done that, since it is impossible for Us to have a son or a wife. Rather, We cast the truth and make it clear, so that falsehood is refuted, and behold, it is gone and vanished. And for you is the punishment in the Hereafter, O polytheists, because of your describing your Lord with a description other than that which befits Him. To Allah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, and those with Him of the angels, they do not disdain His worship nor do they tire of it. So how is it permissible to associate with Him what is His servant and creation? They always remember Allah and glorify Him, they do not weaken or tire.
m-0647	How can it be right for the polytheists to take helpless gods from the earth who are unable to revive the dead? If there were gods in the heavens and the earth other than God Almighty who managed their affairs, their system would be disrupted. God, Lord of the Throne, is far removed and sanctified from what the deniers and disbelievers describe as lies, slander, and every deficiency. Among the evidence of His uniqueness in creation and worship is that He is not questioned about His judgment in His creation, while all of His creation is questioned about their actions. Have these polytheists taken gods other than God who benefit and harm, give life and cause death? Say, O Messenger, to them, “Bring forth what you have of proof for what you have taken as gods.” There is no proof in the Qur’an that you have brought, nor in the previous scriptures, for what you have gone to. They did not associate except out of ignorance and imitation. They are turning away from the truth and denying it.
m-0648	"And We did not send before you, O Messenger, any messenger except that We revealed to him that there is no true deity except Allah, so devote worship to Him alone.

The polytheists said, ""The Most Gracious has taken a son,"" claiming that the angels are daughters of Allah. Allah is far above that. So the angels are servants of Allah, brought near to Him, distinguished by virtues. And in their good obedience, they do not speak except what their Lord commands them to do, and they do not do any work until He gives them permission.

And the polytheists said, ""The Most Gracious has taken a son,"" claiming that the angels are daughters of Allah. Allah is far above that. So the angels are servants of Allah, brought near to Him, distinguished by virtues. And in their good obedience, they do not speak except what their Lord commands them to do, and they do not do any work until He gives them permission.

And there is not a single act of the angels, past or future, but Allah, the Most High, knows it and counts it against them. And they do not come forward to intercede except for those for whom Allah is pleased with their intercession. And they are wary, out of fear of Allah, of disobeying His commands and prohibitions.

And whoever among the angels claims that he is a god with Allah, hypothetically, his recompense is Hell. Such is the recompense We recompense every wrongdoer and polytheist."
m-0649	"Did not those who disbelieved know that the heavens and the earth were joined together, with no separation between them, neither rain from the sky nor vegetation from the earth? Then We separated them by Our power, and sent down rain from the sky and brought forth vegetation from the earth, and made from water every living thing. Will these deniers not believe, and believe in what they see, and worship Allah alone?

And We created mountains on the earth to stabilize it so that it does not shake, and We made broad roads in it, hoping that the creation would be guided to their livelihoods and to the Oneness of their Creator.

And We made the sky a ceiling for the earth, which no pillars would raise, and it is preserved, and the devils do not penetrate it. The disbelievers are heedless and distracted from considering the signs of the sky, the sun, the moon, and the stars, and Allah is the One Who created the night for people to rest in it, and the day for them to seek livelihoods in it, and He created the sun as a sign for the day and the moon as a sign for the night, and each of them has an orbit in which it runs and swims, and does not deviate from it.

And We did not grant to any human being before you, O Messenger, permanence in this world. So if you die, will they hope for eternity after you? This will not happen. And in this verse is evidence that Al-Khidr, peace be upon him, died because he was a human being.

All The soul will inevitably taste death no matter how long it lives in this world. Its existence in life is nothing but a test of the duties, commands and prohibitions, and the changing of circumstances, good and bad. Then the final destination and reference after that is to God alone for reckoning and reward."
m-0650	"And when the disbelievers see you, O Messenger, they will point to you mockingly, saying to one another, “Is this the man who curses your gods and denies the Most Merciful and His blessings and what He has sent down of the Qur’an and guidance?”

Man was created impatient, rushing to things and hastening their occurrence. The Quraysh hastened the punishment and were slow to respond, so Allah warned them that He would show them the punishment they were hastening, so they should not ask Allah to hasten it and make it quick.

And the disbelievers will say, hastening the punishment and mocking, “When will what you promised us, O Muhammad, happen if you and those who follow you are truthful?”

If these disbelievers knew what they would encounter when they are unable to repel the Fire from their faces and backs and find no helper to support them, they would not persist in their disbelief and hasten their punishment.

And the Hour will come upon them suddenly, and they will be perplexed at that and fear greatly, and they will not be able to repel the punishment from themselves, nor will they be given respite to recover their repentance and apology.

And messengers before you were mocked, O Messenger, so the punishment that came upon those who mocked was inflicted. He was the subject of their mockery and ridicule."
m-0651	Say, O Messenger, to those who hasten the punishment, “No one can protect you or guard you, by night or by day, in your sleep or while you are awake, from the punishment of the Most Gracious when it descends upon you. Rather, they are distracted and heedless of the Qur’an and the admonitions of their Lord. Do they have gods that can protect them from Our punishment? Their gods cannot help themselves, so how can they help their worshippers when they are not able to compete with Us?” The disbelievers and their fathers were deceived by the respite, when they saw the wealth, children, and long lives they had, so they persisted in their disbelief, never abandoning it, and they thought that they would not be punished, while they were heedless of a past law. So God reduces the earth from its sides with what He sends down upon the polytheists of punishment in every direction and of defeat. Is it possible for the disbelievers of Mecca to escape the power of God or to avoid death?
m-0652	Say, O Messenger, to those to whom you have been sent, “What do I fear from you of punishment except by revelation from Allah, which is the Qur’an? But the disbelievers do not listen to what is conveyed to them with deliberation when they are warned, so they do not benefit from it.” If the disbelievers were to receive a share of Allah’s punishment, they would know the consequences of their denial, and they would respond to that by praying for their own destruction because of their injustice to themselves by worshipping other than Allah. Allah, the Most High, will set the just scale for reckoning on the Day of Resurrection, and He will not wrong these people or others in the least. Even if this deed is the amount of an atom of good or evil, it will be considered in the reckoning of its owner. And Allah is sufficient as a reckoner of the deeds of His servants and as a rewarder for them.
m-0653	And We gave Moses and Aaron a proof and a victory over their enemy and a Scripture, which is the Torah, by which We distinguished between truth and falsehood, and a light by which the righteous are guided. Those who fear the punishment of their Lord are fearful and apprehensive about the Hour when the Resurrection will take place. And this Qur’an, which Allah revealed to His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is a reminder for those who remember it, act according to its commands, and avoid its prohibitions. It is very good and of great benefit. Do you deny it while it is extremely clear and evident?
m-0654	"And We had given Abraham his guidance, to which he had called the people before Moses and Aaron, and We knew that he was worthy of that.

When he said to his father and his people, “What are these idols that you have made and then persisted in worshipping them?”

They said, “We found our fathers worshipping them, and we worship them, following their example.”

Abraham said to them, “You and your fathers were clearly far from the truth in your worship of these idols.”

They said, “Is this statement that you have brought us true or is your speech to us the speech of a player who does not know what he is saying?”

Abraham, peace be upon him, said to them, “Rather, your Lord, whom I call you to worship, is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, who created them, and I am among the witnesses to that.”

By God, I will plot against your idols and break them after you have turned away from them and gone away.

So Abraham smashed the idols and made them into small pieces, and left the largest ones so that the people would return to him and ask him, so that their weakness and misguidance would be revealed and the proof would be established against them.

The people returned and saw their idols smashed and humiliated, so they asked each other who had done this. By our gods, he is truly unjust in his insolence towards the gods who are worthy of veneration and reverence.

He who heard Abraham swear that he would plot against their idols said, ""We heard a young man called Abraham speaking ill of the idols.""

Their leaders said, ""So they brought Abraham in front of the people so that they could testify to his admission of what he said, so that it would be an argument against him.""

And Abraham was brought and they asked him, denying it, ""Are you the one who broke our gods?"" They meant their idols.

And Abraham achieved what he wanted to show of their foolishness in front of them, so he said, arguing with them and exposing their stupidity, ""Rather, the one who broke them was this great idol. So ask your alleged gods about that, if they speak or are confused in answering.""

So their hands were lowered and their error became clear to them, how can they worship them while they are unable to defend themselves or answer their questioner? And they admitted to their own injustice and polytheism.

And their stubbornness quickly returned to them after they had been silenced, so they turned to falsehood and argued with Abraham with what was an argument against them, saying, ""How can we ask them when they know?"" They do not speak

Abraham said, belittling the idols, ""How do you worship idols that neither benefit if they are worshipped nor harm if they are abandoned? Ugly for you and for your gods whom you worship besides Allah. Do you not reason and realize the evil of what you are doing?""

Abraham said, belittling the idols, ""How do you worship idols that neither benefit if they are worshipped nor harm if they are abandoned? Ugly for you and for your gods whom you worship besides Allah. Do you not reason and realize the evil of what you are doing?""

When their argument was invalidated and the truth became clear, they turned to using their authority and said, ""Burn Abraham with fire in anger for your gods, if you are to support them."" So they lit a great fire and threw him into it, and Allah aided His Messenger and said to the fire, ""Be cool and safe for Abraham."" So no harm came to him in it, nor did any harm befall him."
m-0655	"When their argument was invalidated and the truth became clear, they turned to using their authority and said, “Burn Abraham with fire in anger for your gods, if you are going to support them.” So they lit a great fire and threw him into it, but God granted victory to His Messenger and said to the fire, “Be cool and safe for Abraham.” So no harm came to him therein, nor did any harm befall him.

The people wanted to destroy Abraham, but God thwarted their plot and made them the lowest and most defeated.

And We saved Abraham and Lot, who believed in him, from Iraq, and brought them out to the land of Ash-Sham, which We blessed with abundant goodness, and in it were most of the prophets, peace and blessings be upon them.

And God bestowed His favor upon Abraham, so He gave him his son Isaac when he called him, and He gave him from Isaac Jacob in addition to that, and each of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, God made him righteous and obedient to Him.

And We made Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob an example for the people, calling them to worship and obey Him by His permission, the Most High. And We inspired them to do good deeds, such as acting according to the laws of the prophets, establishing prayer in its proper manner, and giving zakat, so they complied with that and were Submissive and obedient to God alone"
m-0656	And We gave Lot prophethood and the ability to decide between opponents and knowledge of God’s command and His religion. And We saved him from his city of Sodom, whose people were doing evil deeds. Indeed, because of the evil deeds and abominations they were doing, they were people of evil and ugliness, disobeying God. And God completed His favor upon him and included him in His mercy by saving him from what had befallen his people, because he was among those who worked in obedience to God.
m-0657	And remember, O Messenger, Noah, when he called upon his Lord before you and before Abraham and Lot. So We answered his call and saved him and his believing family from severe distress. And We supported him from the plot of the people who denied Our signs. Indeed, they were people of ugliness. So We drowned them all in the flood.
m-0658	And remember, O Messenger, the Prophet of God, David and his son Solomon, when they judged in a case brought by two opponents, one of whom had attacked the crops of the other and had spread out at night, destroying the crops. David ruled that the sheep belonged to the owner of the crops, for what they had destroyed, so their value was equal. And We were witnesses to their judgment, and it was not hidden from Us. So We made Solomon understand the consideration of the interests of both parties with justice, so he ruled that the owner of the sheep should repair the damaged crops during a period in which the owner of the crops would benefit from the benefits of the sheep, such as milk and wool, and so on. Then the sheep would return to their owner and the crops to their owner, equalizing the value of the damaged crops for the benefit of the sheep. And to both David and Solomon We gave judgment and knowledge. And We favored David by making the mountains glorify with him when he glorified, and likewise the birds glorify, and We were doing that. And God distinguished David, peace be upon him, by teaching him the craft of armour, making it into interlocking rings that facilitate the movement of the body to protect the warriors from the impact of weapons on them. Are you grateful for the favor of God upon you, as He made it through His servant David? And We subjected to Solomon the wind, violently The winds carried him and those with him, running by his command to the land of Jerusalem in Ash-Sham, which We have blessed with many good things. Our knowledge encompasses all things. And We subjected to Solomon from the devils devils whom he used in what others were unable to do. They would dive into the sea and extract for him pearls and jewels. They would also work in the manufacture of whatever he wanted from them. They were unable to resist what he wanted from them. May God protect them for him with His strength and glory, glory be to Him, the Most High.
m-0659	And remember, O Messenger, Our servant Job, when We tested him with great distress and illness in his body, and he lost his family, his wealth, and his children. He was patient and sought reward, and called upon his Lord, the Mighty and Sublime, “Verily, distress has befallen me, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful, so remove it from me.” So We answered his prayer and removed the affliction from him, and restored to him what he had lost of family, children, and wealth, doubly so. We did that to him as a mercy from Us, and so that he would be an example for every patient person in the face of affliction, hoping for the mercy of his Lord and worshipping Him. And remember Ismail, Idris, and Dhul-Kifl. All of these were among those who were patient in obeying Allah, the Most High, and in refraining from disobeying Him, and in the face of His decrees, so they deserved to be mentioned with beautiful praise. And We included them in Our mercy, for they were among those whose inner and outer beings were sound, so they obeyed Allah and did what He commanded them to do.
m-0660	And remember the story of the companion of the whale, he is Yunus bin Matta, peace be upon him, God sent him to his people, so he called them but they did not believe, so he threatened them with punishment, but they did not repent and did not have patience with them as God commanded him, and he left them angry with them, his chest constricted by their disobedience, and he thought that God would not make things difficult for him and punish him for this violation, so God tested him with severe distress and imprisonment, and the whale swallowed him in the sea, so he called upon his Lord in the darkness of the night, the sea and the belly of the whale, repenting and admitting his injustice for not having patience with his people, saying, “There is no god but You; glory be to You. Indeed, I was among the wrongdoers.” So We answered his prayer and delivered him from the distress of this hardship. And thus do We deliver the believers who act according to Our law.
m-0661	And remember, O Messenger, the story of the servant of God, Zachariah, when he called upon his Lord to grant him children when he was old, saying, “My Lord, do not leave me alone, without descendants. Grant me an heir who will establish the religion among the people after me, for You are the best of survivors and the best of those who succeed me in goodness.” So We answered his prayer and granted him in his old age his son John, and made his wife righteous in her character and fit to bear children and give birth after she had been barren. Indeed, they used to hasten to every good and supplicate Us, desiring what We had, fearing Our punishment, and they were to Us submissive and humble.
m-0662	And remember, O Messenger, the story of Mary, the daughter of Imran, who protected her private parts from what is forbidden and did not commit any immorality in her life. So God sent Gabriel, peace be upon him, to her, and he blew into the pocket of her shirt, and the breath reached her womb. With that breath, God created the Messiah, Jesus, peace be upon him, and she became pregnant with him without a husband. Thus, she and her son were a sign of God’s power and a lesson for creation until the Day of Resurrection.
m-0663	All of these prophets have one religion, Islam, which is submission to God through obedience and worshipping Him alone. God Almighty is the Lord of creation, so worship Him alone, O people, without any partner. But people differed over their messengers, and many of their followers in religion were divided into sects and parties. They worshipped created beings and whims, and all of them will return to Us and be held accountable for what they did. Whoever adheres to faith in God and His messengers and does what he can of good deeds in obedience to God and worship of Him, God will not waste his work or invalidate it, but will multiply it all many times over, and he will find what he did in His book on the Day of Resurrection after his death. It is impossible for the people of the towns that We destroyed because of their disbelief and injustice to return to the world before the Day of Resurrection to make up for what they neglected.
m-0664	So when the dam of Gog and Magog is opened and they set out from the heights of the earth and spread out in its sides, the Day of Resurrection draws near and its terrors become apparent. Then behold, the eyes of the disbelievers are wide open, hardly blinking from the intensity of the terror. They call upon themselves with woe in regret, “Woe to us! We were heedless and unaware of this Day and of the preparation for it. And we were wrongdoers in that.” You, O disbelievers, and whatever you worshipped besides Allah of idols and whoever was pleased with your worship of them from among the jinn and mankind, are the fuel and firewood of Hell. You and they will enter it. If these whom you worshipped besides Allah were gods worthy of worship, they would not have entered the fire of Hell with you, O you. The polytheists, both the worshippers and the worshipped will abide in the fire of Hell. These tormented ones in the fire have pains that are indicated by their sighs, in which their breaths echo while they are in the fire. They do not hear because of the horror of their torment.
m-0665	Those who have been granted good fortune from us in our knowledge that they are from the people of Paradise, they are far from the Fire, so they will not enter it nor will they be near it. They will not hear the sound of its flames and the burning of bodies in it, for they have settled in their homes in Paradise and have become permanent residents of what their souls desire of its pleasures and delights. The great terror on the Day of Resurrection will not frighten them, but the angels will give them good tidings, “This is your Day in which you were promised honor from Allah and abundant reward. The Day when We will roll up the heaven as a scroll is rolled up over what was written in it, and We will resurrect the creation in it in the form in which We created them the first time, just as their mothers bore them. That is the promise of Allah that will not fail. He promised us that, a promise that is true upon Us. Indeed, We are always doing what We promise.”
m-0666	The great terror on the Day of Resurrection will not frighten them, but the angels will give them good tidings, “This is your Day on which you have been promised honor from Allah and abundant reward. The Day when We will roll up the heaven as a scroll is rolled up over what was written therein, and We will resurrect the creation in the form in which We created them the first time, just as their mothers bore them. That is the promise of Allah, which will not fail. Our promise is a true promise upon Us. Indeed, We were always doing what We promised. And We had already written in the revealed Books, after what was written in the Preserved Tablet, that the earth will be inherited by the righteous servants of Allah, who did what they were commanded to do and avoided what they were forbidden to do. They are the nation of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Indeed, in this recitation of the sermon is a sufficient lesson for a people who worship Allah in accordance with what He has prescribed for them and what He is pleased with from them.
m-0667	"And We have not sent you, O Messenger, except as a mercy to all people. So whoever believes in you will be happy and saved, and whoever does not believe will fail and lose. Say, ""Indeed, what has been revealed to me and what I have been sent with is that your God, who alone deserves to be worshipped, is Allah. So submit to Him and submit to His worship."" If these people turn away from Islam, then say to them, ""I have conveyed to you all what Allah has revealed to me. I and you are equal in knowledge in what I have warned you of and cautioned you of. And I do not know after that when the punishment you have been promised will come upon you."" Indeed, Allah knows what you say openly and what you conceal in your hearts, and He will hold you accountable for it. I do not know, perhaps the delay of the punishment you have hastened is a lure for you and a test, and that you may enjoy yourself in this world for a while so that you may increase in disbelief, then your punishment will be greater. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, ""O Lord, judge between us and our people who deny the truthful judgment. And we ask our Lord, the Most Merciful, and we seek His help against what you, O disbelievers, describe of polytheism, denial, and fabrication against Him, and what you threaten us with of victory and dominance."""
m-0668	O people, beware of Allah’s punishment by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. What will happen at the Hour of Resurrection of terrors and violent movement of the earth from which all its sides will crack is a great thing whose magnitude cannot be estimated, whose nature cannot be reached, and whose nature is only known to the Lord of the Worlds. On the Day you see the Hour of Resurrection, a mother will forget her infant whom she breastfed because of the distress that has befallen her, and a pregnant woman will miscarry from terror, and people’s minds will be clouded, for they will be like drunkards from the intensity of terror and fear, and they will not be drunk from wine, but the intensity of the torment has made them lose their minds and their awareness.
m-0669	Some of the leaders of disbelief among the people dispute and doubt God’s ability to resurrect, out of ignorance of the reality of this ability and following the leaders of misguidance from every devil who rebels against God and His messengers. God has decreed and determined that this devil will mislead everyone who follows him and will not guide him to the truth, but will lead him to the torment of the blazing Hell as a reward for following him.
m-0670	O people, if you are in doubt that Allah gives life to the dead, then We created your father Adam from dust, then his offspring were produced from a drop of semen, which the man ejaculates into the womb of the woman, and it is transformed by the power of Allah into a clot, which is thick red blood, then into a lump of flesh, which is a small piece of meat the size of a chewed one, and it is sometimes fully formed, that is, fully formed, and ends up with the fetus coming out alive, and sometimes not fully formed, and it falls off without being complete, so that We may show you the fullness of Our power in directing the stages of creation, and We keep in the wombs whomever We will, which is the created one, until the time of its birth, and the stages are completed with the birth of the fetuses as small children who grow up until they reach maturity, which is the time of youth, strength, and the completion of the mind. Some children may die before that, and some grow up until they reach the age of old age and weakness of the mind, so this long-lived person does not know anything of what he knew before that, and you see the earth dry and dead, with no vegetation in it, but when We send down water upon it, it stirs with vegetation, opening up from it, and rises and increases due to its being watered, and it produces every kind of beautiful plant that pleases the observers. What has been mentioned above of the verses of the power of God Almighty is conclusive evidence that God Almighty is the Lord who is truly worshipped, and that none should be worshipped except Him. He brings the dead back to life and is capable of everything. And that the Hour of Resurrection is coming, there is no doubt about that, and that God will raise the dead from their graves for their reckoning and reward.
m-0671	Among the disbelievers is he who disputes falsely about Allah, His Oneness, His choice of His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and His revelation of the Qur’an. This dispute is without knowledge, clarification, or a Book from Allah in which there is clear proof and argument, twisting his neck in arrogance, turning away from the truth in order to prevent others from entering the religion of Allah. So he will encounter disgrace in this world by his defeat and the exposure of his affair, and We will burn him in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection.

And it will be said to him, “This punishment is because of the sins you committed and the crimes you acquired. And Allah does not punish anyone without sin.” And among the people is he who enters Islam with weakness and doubt, so he worships Allah despite his hesitation, like someone who stands on the edge of a mountain or a wall that does not hold its ground in his stance. And he links his faith to his worldly life. If he lives in health and plenty, he continues in his worship. If he is afflicted with a calamity or hardship, he attributes the bad luck of that to his religion and turns away from it, like someone who turns on his face after being upright. Thus, he has lost this world, because his disbelief will not change what was destined for him in this world, and he has lost the Hereafter by entering the Fire. That is a clear and obvious loss. That loser worships instead of Allah that which will not harm him if he abandons it, nor benefit him if he worships it. That is the misguidance far from the truth. He calls upon those whose harm is certain to be closer than its benefit. The ugliness of that worshipped object as a supporter and the ugliness of a companion.

That loser worships besides Allah that which neither harms him if he abandons it nor benefits him if he worships it. That is the misguidance far from the truth. He calls for a helper and a companion whose real harm is closer than its benefit, like someone who stands on the edge of a mountain or a wall, not holding onto his ground.
m-0672	Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and remain steadfast in that and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow. Indeed, Allah does what He wills of rewarding those who obey Him out of favor and punishing those who disobey Him out of justice. Whoever believes that Allah, the Most High, will not support His Messenger Muhammad with victory in this world by making His religion manifest and in the Hereafter by raising his status and punishing those who deny him, let him extend a rope to the ceiling of his house and strangle himself with it, then let him cut that rope and see if that will remove the anger he finds in himself, for Allah, the Most High, will inevitably support His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
m-0673	"And as Allah established the proof of His power over the disbelievers in the resurrection, He sent down His verses in the Qur’an, clear in their wording and meaning, by which Allah guides whomever He wants to guide, because there is no guide other than Him.

Indeed, those who believe in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the Jews and the Sabians, who are a people who remain on their nature and do not follow a religion established for them, and the Christians and the Magians, who are worshippers of fire, and those who associate others with Allah, who are worshippers of idols, Allah will judge between them all on the Day of Resurrection. He will admit the believers into Paradise and admit the disbelievers into Hell. Indeed, Allah is Witness over all things. He witnessed all the deeds of His servants and counted them and preserved them. He will reward each one with what he deserves, a reward in accordance with the deeds they did.

Did you not know, O Prophet, that to Allah, glory be to Him, prostrates in submission and obedience, the angels in the heavens and the creatures on the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, and the beasts, and to Allah prostrate in obedience and choice, and they are the believers, and many people are deserving of punishment, so they are humiliated. And any person whom Allah humiliates has no one to honor him. Indeed, Allah does in His creation what He wills according to his wisdom"
m-0674	"These are two groups who differed about their Lord: the people of faith and the people of disbelief. Each one claims that he is right. As for those who disbelieve, the torment will surround them in the form of garments made for them from fire which they wear, burning their bodies. Extremely hot water will be poured over their heads and will descend into their bodies, melting what is in them until it reaches their skins and burns them until they fall off. The angels will strike them on their heads with iron hammers.

m-0675	God Almighty admits the people of faith and righteous deeds into gardens of eternal bliss, beneath whose trees rivers flow. They are adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their usual clothing in Paradise is silk, both men and women. God has guided them in this world to good speech, such as the word of monotheism, praise of God, and thanks to Him, and in the Hereafter to praise Him for the good outcome, just as He had guided them before to the praiseworthy path of Islam that leads to Paradise.
m-0676	Indeed, those who disbelieved in Allah and denied what Muhammad (peace be upon him) brought to them and prevented others from entering the religion of Allah and prevented the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the believers in the year of Hudaybiyyah from the Sacred Mosque which We made for all believers, alike, those who reside in it and those who come to it - for them is a painful and grievous punishment. And whoever intends in the Sacred Mosque to deviate from the truth unjustly and disobeys Allah therein - We will make him taste a painful and grievous punishment. And remember, O Prophet, when We explained to Abraham, peace be upon him, the location of the House and prepared it for him, although it was unknown, and We commanded him to build it on piety towards Allah and His Oneness and to purify it from disbelief, innovations and impurities so that it would be spacious for those who circumambulate it and those who stand and pray near it. And inform the people, O Abraham, of the obligation of Hajj upon them. They will come to you in various states, on foot and riding, on every lean camel, which is light in flesh from walking and work, not from emaciation. They will come from every distant road to bring benefits for them from forgiveness of their sins and the reward of performing their rituals and their obedience and their earnings in their trade and other things and to mention the name of Allah upon the earth. Slaughtering the camels, cows and sheep they seek to draw near to Allah on specific days, namely the tenth of Dhul-Hijjah and three days after it, as thanks to Allah for His blessings. They are commanded to eat from these sacrifices as a recommended act and to feed from them the poor who are extremely poor. And inform the people, O Ibrahim, of the obligation of Hajj upon them. They come to you in all their states, on foot and riding, on every lean camel, which is light in meat from walking and work, not from emaciation. They come from every distant road to bring benefits for them from the forgiveness of their sins and the reward of performing their rituals and their obedience and their earnings in their trade and other things, and to mention the name of Allah when slaughtering the camels, cows and sheep they seek to draw near to Allah on specific days, namely the tenth of Dhul-Hijjah and three days after it, as thanks to Allah for His blessings. They are commanded to eat from these sacrifices as a recommended act and to feed from them the poor who are extremely poor. Then the pilgrims complete what remains of the ritual by entering ihram and exiting it, by removing the dirt that has accumulated on their bodies and cutting their nails. And to shave their hair and to fulfill what they have obligated upon themselves of Hajj, Umrah, and gifts and to circumambulate the ancient, ancient House that God has freed from the domination of the tyrants over it, which is the Kaaba.
m-0677	That which Allah has commanded of performing the rituals of Hajj, fulfilling vows, and circumambulating the House is what Allah has made obligatory upon you, so honor it. And whoever honors the sacred things of Allah, including His rites, by performing them completely and sincerely for Allah, it is better for him in this world and the Hereafter. And Allah has made lawful for you the eating of livestock, except for what He has forbidden in what is recited to you in the Qur’an, such as dead animals and others, so avoid them. In that is the nullification of what the Arabs used to forbid of some livestock, and stay away from the filth which is idols and from lying which is fabricating against Allah. Upright for Allah in sincere work for Him, turning to Him by worshipping Him alone and singling Him out in obedience, turning away from everything else by rejecting polytheism, for whoever associates anything with Allah is like someone who falls from guidance, perishes, and falls from the height of faith, rather, to the depths of disbelief, and the devils snatch him from every side like someone who falls from the sky, either the birds snatch him and cut off his limbs, or a violent wind takes him and throws him in a distant place. That is what Allah has commanded of His Oneness and sincere worship of Him. He obeys the command of Allah and glorifies the signs of religion, including the acts of Hajj and its places and the sacrifices that are slaughtered in it, by approving of them and making them fat. This glorification is one of the actions of the people of hearts characterized by piety and fear of Allah. In these gifts, you benefit from wool, milk, riding, and other things that do not harm them until the time of slaughtering them at the Ancient House, which is the entire Sanctuary. And for every group of believers who came before, We have appointed rituals of slaughtering and shedding blood, so that they may mention the name of Allah the Most High when slaughtering what He has provided for them from these livestock and thank Him. Your God, O people, is one God, and He is Allah. So submit to His command and the command of His Messenger. And give good tidings, O Prophet, to the humble and submissive to their Lord of the best of this world and the Hereafter. These humble and submissive people are characterized by the fact that when Allah alone is mentioned, they fear His punishment and are wary of disobeying Him. And if hardship and difficulty befall them, they are patient with that, hoping for reward from Allah the Almighty, and they perform the prayer completely. And with that, they spend from what Allah has provided for them in what is obligatory upon them, such as zakat and the maintenance of their children and those who are obligated. And We have made for you the slaughtering of sacrificial animals from the rites and signs of religion so that you may draw near to Allah. For you, O you who draw near, there is good in its benefits of eating, charity, reward and recompense. So say when slaughtering it, “In the name of Allah.” And the camels are slaughtered standing, with three of their legs in line and the fourth tied up. So when they fall to the ground on their sides, eating them is permissible. So let those who draw near to them eat from them out of worship, and feed from them the contented, who is the poor who did not ask out of chastity, and the needy who asks for his need. Thus Allah has subjected the sacrificial animals to you that you may thank Allah for subjecting them to you. Allah will not gain anything from the meat of these sacrifices or their blood, but rather he will gain it through sincerity in them and that the intention in them is for the sake of Allah alone. Thus He has subjected them to you, O you who draw near, so that you may glorify Allah and thank Him for the truth that He has guided you to, for He is worthy of that. And give good tidings, O Prophet, to the doers of good by worshipping Allah alone and to those who do good to His creation with every good and success.
m-0678	Allah the Almighty protects the believers from the aggression of the infidels and the plots of the wicked because He, the Almighty, does not love anyone who betrays the trust of his Lord and is ungrateful for His blessings. In the beginning, the Muslims were forbidden from fighting the infidels and were ordered to be patient with their harm. When the harm of the polytheists reached its peak and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, left Mecca to migrate to Medina and Islam gained strength, Allah permitted the Muslims to fight because of the injustice and aggression that befell them. Allah the Almighty is able to grant them victory and humiliate their enemy. Those who were forced to leave their homes for no reason other than that they converted to Islam and said, “Our Lord is Allah alone.” If it were not for what Allah has prescribed of repelling injustice and falsehood by fighting, the truth would have been defeated in every nation and the earth would have been destroyed and places of worship would have been demolished, including the monasteries of monks, the churches of Christians, the temples of Jews, and the mosques of Muslims in which they pray and mention the name of Allah often. Whoever strives to support the religion of Allah, Allah will support him against his enemy. Allah is Strong, and cannot be defeated. He is Mighty, and cannot be harmed. He has subdued the creation and seized their forelocks. Those whom We have promised Our victory are those who, if We establish them in the land and make them successors therein, establish prayer by performing it at its appointed times and within its limits, and give the zakat of their wealth to its people, and enjoin all that God has enjoined of His rights and the rights of His servants, and forbid all that God and His Messenger have forbidden. And to God alone belongs the final destination of all matters, and the outcome is for piety.
m-0679	"And if your people belie you, O Messenger, then before them in belying their messengers were the people of Noah, Aad, Thamud, the people of Abraham, the people of Lot, and the people of Midian, who belied Shu`ayb and denied Pharaoh and his people Moses. So I did not hasten to punish these nations, but rather I gave them respite, then I seized each one of them with the punishment. So how was My denial of their disbelief and denial, and exchanging the blessings they had with punishment and destruction? And if your people belie you, O Messenger, then before them in belying their messengers were the people of Noah, Aad, Thamud, the people of Abraham, the people of Lot, and the people of Midian, who belied Shu`ayb and denied Pharaoh and his people Moses. So I did not hasten to punish these nations, but rather I gave them respite, then I seized each one of them with the punishment. So how was My denial of their disbelief and denial, and exchanging the blessings they had with punishment and destruction? Pharaoh and his people Moses, so I did not hasten to punish these nations, but I gave them respite, then I took each of them with the punishment. So how was my denial of them for their disbelief and denial and changing the blessing they had with punishment and destruction?

Many of the unjust towns, because of their disbelief, We destroyed their people. Their homes are in ruins, emptied of their inhabitants, their wells are not used for drinking, and their high, decorated palaces did not protect their people from the evil of the punishment.

Did not the deniers of Quraysh travel through the land to see the traces of those who were destroyed, so they could reflect with their minds and take heed, and hear their news with contemplation and take heed? For blindness is not blindness of sight, but rather the blindness that destroys is blindness of insight from perceiving the truth and taking heed."
m-0680	And the unbelievers of Quraysh hasten you, O Messenger, because of their extreme ignorance of the punishment with which you warned them when they persisted in disbelief. And Allah will not fail to fulfill what He promised them of punishment, for it must occur. And He hastened that for them in this world on the Day of Badr. And indeed, one day with Allah, which is the Day of Resurrection, is like a thousand years of what you count of the years of this world. And many of the towns were unjust because their people persisted in disbelief, so I granted them respite and did not hasten the punishment upon them, so they were deceived. Then I seized them with My punishment in this world, and to Me is their return after their destruction, so I will punish them with what they deserve.
m-0681	Say, O Messenger, O mankind, I am only a warner to you, conveying from Allah His Message. So those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and that has been established in their hearts, and done righteous deeds, for them is pardon for their sins and forgiveness, with which He will cover their sins and a good provision that will not cease, which is Paradise. And those who strive in plotting to invalidate the verses of the Qur’an by denying them, being submissive and overpowering, those are the people of the blazing Fire. They will enter it and remain therein forever. ... And that settled in their hearts and they did righteous deeds for them with God, forgiveness for their sins and pardon for what they committed of disobedience and a good provision that does not cease, which is Paradise. And those who strive in plotting to invalidate the verses of the Qur’an by denying, disobeying and overpowering, those are the people of the blazing Fire. They will enter it and remain in it forever.
m-0682	And We did not send before you, O Messenger, any messenger or prophet except that when he recited the Book of Allah, Satan cast into his recitation whisperings and doubts to turn people away from following what he reads and recites. But Allah nullifies the plot of Satan, removing his whisperings and confirming His clear verses. And Allah is Knowing of what was and what will be. Nothing is hidden from Him. He is Wise in His estimation and command. This action of Satan was only to make it a test for those in whose hearts there is doubt and hypocrisy, and for the hard-hearted polytheists who are not affected by rebuke. And indeed, the wrongdoers among these and those are in intense enmity toward Allah and His Messenger, and in opposition to the truth, far from the right path. And let the people of knowledge who distinguish between truth and falsehood with their knowledge know that the Noble Qur’an is the truth revealed from Allah to you, O Messenger, with no doubt in it and no way for Satan to it, so that their faith increases and their hearts submit to it. And indeed, Allah is the Guide of those who believe in Him and His Messenger to the clear path of truth, which is Islam. He saves them thereby from misguidance. And the disbelievers who deny will not cease to be in doubt about what you have brought them of the Qur’an until The Hour will come to them suddenly while they are still denying it, or there will come to them the punishment of a Day in which there is no good, which is the Day of Resurrection. The sovereignty and authority on this Day belong to God alone, and He, glory be to Him, will judge between the believers and the disbelievers. Those who believed in God and His Messenger and did righteous deeds will have eternal bliss in Paradise. Those who denied the Oneness of God, belied His Messenger, and denied the verses of the Qur’an will have a punishment that will disgrace and humiliate them in Hell.
m-0683	"And those who go forth from their homes seeking the pleasure of Allah and the victory of His religion - whether they are killed fighting the disbelievers or die without fighting - Allah will surely provide for them Paradise and its pleasures that never cease or end. And indeed, Allah, the Most High, is the best of providers. Allah will surely admit them to the entrance they love, which is Paradise. And indeed, Allah is Knowing of those who go forth in His cause. And whoever goes forth seeking the worldly life, He is Forbearing toward those who disobey Him, so He does not hasten to punish them. This is the matter that We have related to you about admitting the emigrants to Paradise. And whoever is attacked and wronged, He has permitted him to respond to the wrongdoer in the same manner, and there is no blame upon him. But if the wrongdoer returns to harming him and transgressing, then Allah will support the wronged and wronged one, since it is not permissible for him to be attacked because he is seeking revenge for himself. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Forgiving. He pardons the sinners, so He does not hasten to punish them and forgives their sins. That is He who has prescribed for you these just rulings. He is the Truth and He is Able to do whatever He wills. And from His power is that He includes what is missing from the hours of the night in the hours of the day and includes what is missing from the hours of the day in the hours of the night. And indeed, Allah is All-Hearing. For every voice, He is All-Seeing of every action, nothing is hidden from Him.

That is because Allah is the true God, to whom worship is due, and that what the polytheists worship besides Him of idols and rivals is falsehood that neither benefits nor harms. And that Allah is the Most High over His creation in essence, power and might, the Exalted above likenesses and rivals, the Great in His essence and names, for He is greater than everything.

Have you not seen, O Prophet, that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and the earth becomes green with the plants that grow in it? Indeed, Allah is Kind to His servants by extracting plants from the earth with that water. He is All-Aware of their interests.

To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, in creation, dominion and servitude. Everyone is in need of His management and favor. Indeed, Allah is the Rich, who does not need anything, the Praiseworthy in every situation.

Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is on the earth of beasts and cattle, crops and fruits, and inanimate objects for your riding and food and all your benefits, just as He has subjected to you the ships that sail in the sea by His power and command, carrying you with your luggage to wherever you wish from Countries and places, and He is the One who holds the heavens and preserves them so that they do not fall upon the earth and those on it perish except by His permission, glory be to Him. Indeed, God is to the people Kind and Merciful in what He has subjected to them of these things and others as a favor from Him to them. And He is God Almighty who gave you life by creating you from nothingness, then He causes you to die when your lives come to an end, then He brings you to life by resurrection to hold you accountable for your deeds. Indeed, man is ungrateful for what has appeared of the signs indicating the power of God and His Oneness."
m-0684	"For every nation of the past, We made a law and a worship which We commanded them to do, and they acted upon it. So let not the polytheists of Quraysh dispute with you, O Messenger, concerning your law and what Allah has commanded you to do in the rituals and all types of worship. Call to the Oneness of your Lord and to sincerely worship Him and to follow His command. Indeed, you are on a straight religion with no crookedness in it.

And if they insist on arguing with you in falsehood regarding what you are calling them to, then do not argue with them, but say to them, ""Allah knows best what you do of disbelief and denial."" They are stubborn and obstinate.

Allah the Most High will judge between the Muslims and the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences in religion. In this verse is good etiquette in responding to those who argue out of stubbornness and arrogance.

Did you not know, O Prophet, that Allah knows what is in the heaven and the earth with complete knowledge, and He has established it in the Preserved Tablet? Indeed, that knowledge is an easy matter for Allah, for whom nothing is impossible.

And the disbelievers of Quraysh insist on associating partners with Allah with Him, despite the apparent falsehood of what they are upon. They worship gods for which no proof has been revealed in any of Allah's books that they are suitable for worship, and they have no knowledge of what they have invented. And they have fabricated it against Allah, but it is only a matter in which they followed their fathers without evidence. So when the time of reckoning comes in the Hereafter, the polytheists will have no helper to aid them or to avert the punishment from them. And when the clear verses of the Qur’an are recited to these polytheists, you will see the hatred evident on their faces. They almost attack the believers who call them to Allah Almighty and recite His verses to them. Say to them, O Messenger, “Shall I not inform you of what is more hateful to you than hearing the truth and seeing those who call to it? The Fire has been prepared for the disbelievers in the Hereafter. And wretched is the place to which they will end up.”"
m-0685	O people, a parable has been made, so listen to it and ponder it. The idols and rivals that you worship besides Allah will not be able together to create a single fly, so how about creating something greater? They are not able to extract what the fly takes from them. Is there any weakness after that? They are both weak together. The weakest of those who seek, who is the worshipped besides Allah, is that they cannot extract what the fly has taken from them, and the weakest of those who are sought, who is the fly. So how can these idols and rivals be taken as gods and be thus humiliated? These polytheists have not glorified Allah as He should be glorified, since they have made partners for Him, while He is the Strong Who created everything, the Mighty Who cannot be defeated. Allah, the Most High, chooses from among the angels messengers to His prophets, and He chooses from among the people messengers to convey His messages to creation. Allah is All-Hearing of the words of His servants, All-Seeing of all things and of whom He chooses for the message from among His creation. He, the Most High, knows what is in the hands of His angels and messengers before He creates them, and He knows what will happen after their demise. To Allah alone do matters return. Allah, the Most High, chooses from Angels are messengers to His prophets, and He chooses messengers from among people to convey His messages to creation. God hears the words of His servants and sees all things and whom He chooses for the message from among His creation. He, glory be to Him, knows what is in the hands of His angels and messengers before He creates them, and He knows what will happen after their demise. To God alone do all matters return.
m-0686	O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, bow and prostrate in your prayers and worship your Lord alone, with no partner for Him, and do good that you may succeed. And strive hard against your souls and stand up completely for the command of Allah and call people to His path and strive with your wealth, your tongues and your souls, sincerely intending it for Allah, the Almighty, the Majestic, submitting your hearts and your limbs to Him. He has chosen you to carry this religion and has bestowed upon you a blessing by making your law tolerant, with no restriction or severity in its obligations and rulings as was the case with some nations before you. This tolerant religion is the religion of your father Abraham. Allah has named you Muslims before in the previous revealed books and in this Qur’an. He has singled you out with this choice so that the Seal of the Messengers Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, may bear witness over you that he conveyed to you the message of his Lord and you may be witnesses over the nations that His Messengers conveyed to them what Allah informed you of in His Book. So you must recognize the value of this blessing and be grateful for it and preserve the landmarks of Allah’s religion by performing the prayer with its pillars and conditions and paying the obligatory zakat and O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger Muhammad, bow and prostrate in your prayers and worship your Lord alone, with no partner for Him, and do good that you may succeed, and strive against yourselves and stand up completely for the command of Allah, and call people to His path, and strive with your wealth, your tongues, and yourselves, sincerely intending for Allah, the Almighty, and submitting your hearts and limbs to Him. He has chosen you to carry this religion, and He has bestowed upon you a favor by making your law easy, without any restriction or severity in its obligations and rulings, as was the case with some nations before you. This easy-going religion is the religion of your father Abraham, and Allah has named you Muslims before in the previous revealed books and in this Qur’an, and He has singled you out with this choice so that the Seal of the Messengers Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, may bear witness over you that he conveyed to you the message of his Lord, and you may be witnesses over the nations that their messengers conveyed to them what Allah informed you of in His Book. So you must recognize this. The blessing is its destiny, so be grateful for it and preserve the features of God’s religion by performing the prayer with its pillars and conditions and paying the obligatory zakat and seek refuge in God Almighty and put your trust in Him, for He is the best protector for those who turn to Him and the best supporter for those who seek His aid.
m-0687	"Those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and act according to His law have succeeded

Those whose characteristics include being humble in their prayers, devoting their hearts to it and calming their limbs

And those who leave behind all that is not good in words and actions

And those who purify their souls and their wealth by paying the zakat on their wealth of all kinds

And those who guard their private parts from what Allah has forbidden of adultery, sodomy and all indecencies

Except for their wives or those their right hands possess of female slaves, there is no blame upon them and no harm in having intercourse with them and enjoying them because Allah has made them permissible

Whoever seeks to enjoy someone other than his wife or female slave is one of those who have transgressed from what is permissible to what is forbidden and has exposed himself to the punishment and wrath of Allah

And those who guard everything that they have been entrusted with, fulfilling all their covenants

And those who are constant in performing their prayers at their appointed times in the prescribed manner as reported from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace

These believers are the inheritors of Paradise

Those who inherit the highest and middle stations of Paradise, they are therein eternally, their pleasure never ending and never disappearing"
m-0688	"And We created Adam from clay taken from all over the earth.

Then We created his children, reproducing from a sperm-drop, which is the sperm of men, that comes out of their loins and settles firmly in the wombs of women.

Then We made the sperm-drop into a clot, that is, red blood. Then We made the clot after forty days into a lump of flesh, that is, a piece of flesh the size of a chewed one. Then We made the soft lump of flesh into bones, and We clothed the bones with flesh. Then We developed it into another creation by breathing the soul into it. So blessed be Allah, Who has perfected everything He has created.

Then you, O humans, after the stages of life and the expiration of ages, will die.

Then, after death and the expiration of the world, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection alive from your graves for reckoning and recompense."
m-0689	And We have certainly created above you seven heavens, one above the other, and We are not unaware of creation, so We do not neglect a creature nor do We forget it. And We sent down from the sky water in proportion to the need of the creatures, and We made the earth a resting place for this water. And indeed, We are Able to take away the settled water. And in this is a threat and warning to the wrongdoers. So We created with this water for you gardens of palm trees and grapes, in which you have fruits of many kinds and shapes, and from which you eat. And We created with it for you the olive tree, which grows around Mount Sinai, from which oil is pressed, and it is used as a condiment. And indeed, O people, in camels, cows, and sheep there is a lesson for you to consider by their creation. We give you to drink from what is in their bellies of milk, and for you in them are many other benefits, such as wool and hides and the like, and from them you eat. And on camels and ships, on land and sea, you are carried.
m-0690	"And We sent Noah to his people with the call to monotheism, and he said to them, ""Worship Allah alone; you have no god worthy of worship other than Him, the Most High, the Most Great."" So worship Him sincerely, then will you not fear His punishment? But the nobles of his people denied him and said to the common people, ""He is a man like you, in no way distinguished from you, and he does not want by his words anything but leadership and superiority over you. And if Allah had willed to send us a messenger, He would have sent him from the angels. We have never heard of anything like this among our fathers and grandfathers who came before us."" And Noah was only a man possessed by madness, so wait until he recovers and abandons his call or dies, and you will be relieved of him.

The nobles of his people denied him and said to the common people, ""He is a man like you, in no way distinguished from you, and he does not want by his words anything but leadership and superiority over you."" And if Allah had willed to send us a messenger, He would have sent him from the angels. We have never heard of anything like this among our fathers and grandfathers who came before us. And Noah said, ""My Lord, help me against my people."" Because of their denial Me regarding what you conveyed to them of your message

So We inspired him, ""Make the ship in our sight and with our command for you and with our assistance, and you are in our protection and care."" So when Our command comes to punish your people by drowning and the flood begins, water springs forth forcefully from the oven, which is the place where they bake bread, as a sign of the coming of the punishment. So enter into the ship from every living thing, male and female, so that the offspring may remain, and enter your family except for those who deserve the punishment for their disbelief, such as your wife and your son. And do not ask me for the salvation of your wrongdoing people, for they will inevitably be drowned."" In this verse, the attribute of the eye is proven for God Almighty in a manner befitting Him, without likening or specifying.

So when you ascend the ship, settled on it, you and those with you, safe from drowning, then say, ""Praise be to God, who has saved us from the disbelieving people.""

And say, ""My Lord, make easy for me the blessed and secure descent, and You are the best of those who grant a place of descent."" In this is a teaching from God Almighty to His servants when they descend, that they should say this.

Indeed, in the salvation of the believers and the destruction of the disbelievers, there are clear signs of the truthfulness of the Messengers of God in what they brought from God, and We are testing the nations by sending Messengers to them before the occurrence of Punishment for them"
m-0691	"Then We created after the people of Noah another generation, the people of Aad.

So We sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, Hud, peace be upon him, who said to them, ""Worship God alone. You have no true deity other than Him. Will you not then fear His punishment if you worship other than Him?""

The nobles and notables from among his people who disbelieved in God and denied the life of the Hereafter and were led astray by the luxury of life that He had bestowed upon them in this world said, ""This is not he who calls you to the Oneness of God except a human being like you who eats from the same kind of food and drinks from the same kind of drink.

And if you follow an individual like you, then indeed you will be losers by abandoning your gods and following him.

How can you believe what he promises you, that when you die and become dust and crumbled bones, you will emerge from your graves alive?

Far from the truth is what you are promised, O people, that after your death you will emerge alive from your graves.

Our life is only in this world. Our fathers die among us and our sons live, and we will not be brought out alive again.

And this who calls you to faith is not but a man who has invented They lied to God and we do not believe what he said to us.

So their messenger called upon his Lord, saying, “My Lord, help me against them because of their denial of me.”

And God, answering his call, said, “In a little while they will regret it.” That is, after a short time, these deniers will regret it.

And it was not long before a violent blast came to them with a wind with which God destroyed them, so they all died and became like the scum of a torrent that floats on the water. So destruction for these wrongdoers and distance for them from the mercy of God. So let the listeners beware of denying their messenger, lest what happened to their predecessors happen to them."
m-0692	Then We created after these deniers other nations and creatures, such as the people of Lot, Shu`ayb, Job, and Jonah, may the blessings and peace of God be upon them all. None of these deniers’ nations preceded the appointed time of their destruction, nor did they delay it. Then We sent Our messengers to those nations, one after the other. Whenever a messenger called his nation, they denied him, so We sent them after the other with destruction and devastation. Nothing remained except the news of their destruction, and We made them stories for those after them, who would take them as a lesson, destruction, and devastation for a people who do not believe in the messengers and do not obey them.
m-0693	Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our nine signs, which are the staff, the hand, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, the blood, the flood, the years, and a decrease in fruits, as a clear proof that would subdue the hearts, so that the hearts of the believers would submit to it and the proof would be established against the obstinate. We sent them to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and the nobles of his people, but they were too arrogant to believe in Moses and his brother. They were a people who were arrogant toward the people and oppressed them with injustice. We sent them to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and the nobles of his people, but they were too arrogant to believe in Moses and his brother. They were a people who were arrogant toward the people and oppressed them with injustice. We sent them to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and the nobles of his people, but they were too arrogant to believe in Moses and his brother. They were a people who were arrogant toward the people and oppressed them with injustice. We sent them to Pharaoh, the ruler of Egypt, and the nobles of his people, but they were too arrogant to believe in Moses and his brother. They were a people who were arrogant toward the people and oppressed them with injustice. They said, “Shall we believe two individuals like us, while their people from the Children of Israel are under our command, obedient and humbled to us?” So they denied them in what they had brought. And We gave Moses the Torah so that his people might be guided by it to the truth. And We made Jesus, the son of Mary, and his mother a sign indicating Our power when We created him without a father, and We made for them a shelter in a high place on the earth, level for them to settle on, in which there is fertility and running water, apparent to the eyes.
m-0694	"O Messengers, eat from the good and lawful provision and do righteous deeds. Indeed, I am Knowing of what you do. Nothing of your deeds is hidden from Me. The address in the verse is general to the Messengers, peace be upon them, and their followers. The verse is evidence that eating lawful food helps in doing good deeds and that the consequences of what is unlawful are dire, including the rejection of supplications. Your religion, O group of prophets, is one religion, which is Islam, and I am your Lord, so fear Me by obeying My commands and avoiding My prohibitions. The followers split into parties and sects in religion, making their religions into religions after they were ordered to unite. Each party is pleased with its opinion, claiming that it is on the right path and the other is on falsehood. This is a warning against partisanship and division in religion. So leave them, O Messenger, in their misguidance and ignorance of the truth until the punishment descends upon them. Do these disbelievers think that what We provide them with of wealth and children in this world is hastening good for them that they deserve? We only hasten good for them as a trial and a lure, but they do not feel that. Do these disbelievers think that what We provide them with of wealth and children in this world is hastening good for them that they deserve? We hasten for them good only as a trial for them and a lure, but they perceive not that.

Those who, out of fear of their Lord, are fearful and apprehensive of that with which Allah has frightened them.

And those who believe in the verses of Allah in the Qur’an and act upon them.

And those who sincerely worship Allah alone and do not associate others with Him.

And those who strive hard in good and righteous deeds, but their hearts are fearful that their deeds will not be accepted and that they will not save them from the punishment of their Lord when they return to Him for reckoning.

Those are the ones who strive hard in obedience. Their habit is to hasten to every good deed and they are the forerunners in good deeds."
m-0695	And We do not charge any of Our servants except what he can do. And their deeds are recorded with Us in the Book of Enumeration of Deeds which the angels raise up. It speaks the truth about them, and none of them is wronged. But the hearts of the disbelievers are in deep error from this Qur’an and what is in it. And they have, along with their polytheism, evil deeds which Allah gives them respite to do, so that they may incur the wrath and punishment of Allah. Until, when We seize the luxurious and the arrogant among them with Our punishment, at once they raise their voices, beseeching and seeking help. Then it is said to them, “Do not cry out and do not seek help today. Indeed, you cannot help yourselves, nor can anyone help you against the punishment of Allah.” The verses of the Qur’an were recited to you so that you might believe in them, but you were averse to hearing them, believing in them, and acting upon them, as one who turns back on his heels does. You do that, being arrogant toward people without right, because of the Sacred House of Allah, saying, “We are its people, and we will not be defeated therein,” and you converse around it with evil speech. Have they not pondered the Qur’an and recognized its truth? Or has it prevented them from believing that a Messenger and a Book have come to them? Their forefathers came with the like of it, but they denied it and turned away from it. Or is it that their Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, is not known to them, so they deny him? Rather, they think he is mad. They have lied. He only brought them the Qur’an, monotheism, and the true religion, and most of them hate the truth out of envy and malice. If God had prescribed for them what would agree with their desires, the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined. Rather, We have brought them what is in their honor and glory, which is the Qur’an, so they turn away from it. Rather, what prevents them from believing is that you, O Messenger, ask them for a reward for your call to them, so they were stingy. You did not do that, for what is with God of reward and giving is better, and He is the best of providers. No one is able to provide like His provision, glory be to Him. And you, O Messenger, are calling your people and others to a sound religion, which is the religion of Islam. And those who do not believe in the resurrection and the reckoning and do not work for them through the sound religion are inclined to other than it. And if We had mercy on them and removed from them what they are suffering from of drought and hunger, they would have persisted in disbelief and obstinacy. They are perplexed and confused. We have certainly tested them with various kinds of calamities, but they did not submit to their Lord, nor did they call upon Him in humility when they descended. Until, when We opened for them a door of severe punishment in the Hereafter, at once they are therein despairing of every good, perplexed, not knowing what to do.
m-0696	"And it is He who created for you hearing to perceive what is heard, and sight to perceive what is seen, and hearts to understand them. However, your gratitude for these successive blessings upon you is little and not worth mentioning.

And it is He who created all people on earth, and to Him you will be gathered after your death, and He will reward you for what you have done of good or evil.

And He alone is the One who gives life from nothingness and causes death after life, and to Him belongs the succession of night and day and their differences. Do you not understand His power and His Oneness?

But the disbelievers did not believe in resurrection, but rather repeated the saying of their ancestors who denied it.

They said, “If we die and our bodies and bones dissolve in the dust of the earth, will we live again?” This cannot happen and is not conceivable.

This speech was said to our fathers before, just as you are saying it to us, O Muhammad, but we did not see it as a reality. This is nothing but the falsehoods of the ancients.

Say to them, “To whom belongs this earth and those in it, if you have knowledge?”

They will certainly acknowledge that it belongs to God, He is its Creator and Owner.

Say to them, “Does that not remind you that He is able to resurrect and bring about resurrection?”

Say, “Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and the Lord of the Mighty Throne, who is the greatest and highest of all creations?”

They will say, Surely He is Allah, so say to them, “Will you not fear His punishment if you worship other than Him?” Say, “Who owns everything? Who has the treasures of everything? Who protects those who seek His protection? No one is able to protect and defend those whom Allah wants to destroy, nor repel the evil that Allah has decreed, if you know that?” They will reply, “All of that is for Allah.” Say to them, “How can your minds be lost, and you be deceived and distracted from the Oneness of Allah and His obedience and belief in the matter of resurrection and the Hereafter?” Rather, We have brought these deniers the truth in what We sent Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with, and they are liars in their polytheism and denial of resurrection.” Allah did not make a son for Himself, nor would there be another deity with Him, because if there were more than one deity, each deity would be unique among His creatures, and there would be conflict between them, as is the case with the kings of the world, and the order of the universe would be disrupted. Allah, the Most High, is far removed from their description of Him as having a partner or a son. He alone knows what is hidden from His creation and what they have seen, so Allah, the Most High, is far removed from the partner that they claim."
m-0697	"Say, O Messenger, ""My Lord, if You show me in these polytheists what You promise them of Your punishment, then do not destroy me with what You destroy them with, and save me from Your punishment and wrath, and do not place me among the polytheists, the wrongdoers, but make me among those with whom You are pleased."" Say, O Messenger, ""My Lord, if You show me in these polytheists what You promise them of Your punishment, then do not destroy me with what You destroy them with, and save me from Your punishment and wrath, and do not place me among the polytheists, the wrongdoers, but make me among those with whom You are pleased."" And indeed, We are able to show you what We promise them of punishment. If your enemies wrong you, O Messenger, in word or deed, do not respond to them with wrong, but repel their wrong with kindness from you to them. We know best what these polytheists describe of polytheism and denial, and We will recompense them for it with the worst recompense. Say, O Prophet, ""My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the temptation of the devils and their tempting whispers to falsehood and corruption and turning away from the truth. And I seek refuge in You, O Lord, from their presence in any of my affairs."" Say, O Prophet Lord, I seek refuge in You from the temptations of the devils and their tempting whispers to falsehood, corruption, and turning away from the truth. I seek refuge in You, O Lord, from their presence in any of my affairs."
m-0698	"Allah the Almighty tells us about the state of the dying disbeliever or the one who has neglected His command, until when he is on the verge of death and sees what punishment has been prepared for him, he says, “My Lord, return me to this world so that I may make up for what I wasted of faith and obedience.” He does not have that right, so he will not be granted what he asked for nor will he be given respite, for it is only a word he says, a word that will not benefit him and he is not truthful in it. If he were returned to this world, he would return to what he was forbidden from, and the deceased will remain in the barrier and the isthmus between this world and the Hereafter until the Day of Resurrection. When the Day of Resurrection comes and the angel in charge blows the horn and people are resurrected from their graves, then there will be no boasting about lineage at that time as they used to boast about it in this world, and no one will ask anyone. Whoever has many good deeds and their scales of deeds are heavy with them when they are held accountable, then those are the ones who will win Paradise. Whoever has few good deeds on the scales and their bad deeds are heavier, the greatest of which is polytheism, then those are the ones who will fail and lose themselves in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally. The fire will burn their faces while they are frowning therein, their lips will be constricted and their teeth will be exposed. It will be said to them, “Were you not…” Verses of the Qur’an are recited to you in this world, but you used to deny them.

When I conveyed to them their messengers and warned them, they will say on the Day of Resurrection, “Our Lord, our pleasures and our desires, which were decreed upon us in Your prior knowledge, have overcome us, and we were, in our actions, astray from guidance.”

Our Lord, take us out of the Fire and return us to this world. If we return to error, then we are wrongdoers and deserve punishment.

Allah the Almighty will say to them, “Remain in the Fire, humiliated, and do not address Me.” At that, their supplication and hope were cut off.

Indeed, there was a group of My servants, and they were the believers, who used to call upon Him, “Our Lord, we have believed, so conceal our sins and have mercy upon us, for You are the best of the merciful.”

But you were busy mocking them until you forgot to mention Allah, and you continued to deny them, and you used to laugh at them in mockery and derision.

Indeed, I have rewarded this group of My believing servants with the victory of Paradise because of their patience in the face of harm and obedience to Allah.

And the wretched ones in the Fire will be asked, “How many years did you remain in this world and how much of obedience to Allah did you waste therein?”

They will say, due to the horror of the situation and the severity of the torment, “We remained therein a day or part of a day.” So ask the accountants who count the months and the days. He will say to them, “You have not remained but a short time. If you had been patient in obeying God, you would have won Paradise if you had known that.” This is because the period of their stay in this world is very short compared to the length of their time in the Fire."
m-0699	"Did you think, O creation, that We created you indifferently, with no command or prohibition, no reward or punishment, and that you will not be returned to Us in the Hereafter for reckoning and recompense?

So exalted is Allah, the King who controls everything, who is true, and His promise is true, and His threat is true, and everything from Him is true, and He is sanctified from creating anything in vain or foolishly. There is no god but Him, Lord of the Noble Throne, who is the greatest of creations.

And whoever worships, along with the One Allah, another god who has no proof of his deserving worship, then his recompense is only for his evil deeds with his Lord in the Hereafter. Indeed, there is no success or salvation for the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection.

And say, O Prophet, “My Lord, overlook sins and have mercy, for You are the best of those who have mercy on a sinner, accepting his repentance and not punishing him for his sin.”"

m-0700	This is a great Surah of the Qur’an which We have revealed and made it obligatory to act upon its rulings, and We have revealed in it clear evidence so that you, O believers, may remember these clear verses and act upon them. The adulterous man and woman who have never been married, the punishment for each of them is one hundred lashes with a whip. It is established in the Sunnah that with this lashing, they should be banished for a year. And do not let compassion for them lead you to leave the punishment or reduce it if you believe in Allah and the Last Day, acting according to the rulings of Islam. And let a number of believers attend the punishment as a warning, a warning, an admonition, and a consideration. The adulterer will not be satisfied except with marrying a fornicatress or a polytheist who does not acknowledge the prohibition of fornication, and the adulteress will not be satisfied except with marrying a fornicator or a polytheist who does not acknowledge the prohibition of fornication. As for the chaste men and women, they will not be satisfied with that. And this marriage is forbidden to the believers. This is clear evidence of the prohibition of marrying an adulteress until she repents, and likewise the prohibition of marrying an adulterer until he repents.
m-0701	And those who accuse chaste souls, whether men or women, of immorality without four just witnesses, flog them with a whip of eighty stripes and do not accept their testimony ever after. And those are the ones who are outside the obedience of Allah. But whoever repents and regrets and turns back from his accusation and amends his work, then indeed Allah will forgive his sin and have mercy on him and accept his repentance.
m-0702	"And those who accuse their wives of adultery and have no witnesses to their accusation except themselves, each one of them must testify before the judge four times, saying: I bear witness by God that I am truthful in what I accuse her of adultery, and he must add to the fifth testimony a call against himself that he deserves the curse of God if he is lying in what he says.And those who accuse their wives of adultery and have no witnesses to their accusation except themselves, each one of them must testify before the judge four times, saying: I bear witness by God that I am truthful in what I accuse her of adultery, and he must add to the fifth testimony a call against himself that he deserves the curse of God if he is lying in what he says.And with his testimony, the wife deserves the punishment of adultery, which is stoning to death, and this punishment cannot be averted from her unless she testifies in return for his testimony four times by God that he is lying in his accusation of adultery, and she must add to the fifth testimony a call against herself that she deserves the wrath of God if her husband is truthful in his accusation of her, and in this case they are separated ... He is a liar in accusing her of adultery, and she adds in the fifth testimony the invocation against herself that she deserves the wrath of God if her husband is truthful in his accusation against her, and in this case they are separated. And if it were not for God’s favor and mercy upon you, O believers, by this legislation for husbands and wives, He would have made permissible for the liar among those who curse each other what he invoked against himself, and God is Forgiving to those of His servants who repent, and He is Wise in His law and management."
m-0703	"Those who came with the most heinous lie, which is accusing the Mother of the Believers Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her) of immorality, are a group affiliated with you, the Muslims. Do not think that their words are bad for you, rather they are good for you, because it includes the exoneration of the Mother of the Believers and her integrity, and the praise of her memory, and the elevation of ranks, and the expiation of sins, and the testing of the believers for every individual who spoke the slander, as a punishment for his action of sin, and the one who bore most of it, and he is Abdullah bin Ubay bin Salul, the leader of the hypocrites, may Allah curse him, for him there is a great punishment in the Hereafter, which is eternity in the lowest level of Hell. Why did not the believing men and women think well of each other when they heard that slander, which is safety from what they accused them of, and they said, “This is an obvious lie against Aisha (may Allah be pleased with her)?” Why did not the slanderers bring four just witnesses to their words? When they did not do that, then those are the liars in the sight of Allah. And were it not for Allah’s grace and mercy upon you, such that His kindness encompassed you in your religion and your worldly life, and He did not hasten your punishment and accepted the repentance of those among you who repented, He would have afflicted you because of what you were involved in with a punishment. GreatWhen you receive the slander and pass it on with your mouths, and it is a false statement and you have no knowledge of it, and they are forbidden to speak falsehood and speak without knowledge, and you think that it is something insignificant, while in the sight of Allah it is great, and in this is a strong warning against being lenient in spreading falsehoodWhy did you not say when you heard it what is permissible for us to speak this lie, to purify you, O Lord, from saying that about the wife of your Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for it is a great lie in terms of sin and deserving of guiltAllah reminds you and forbids you from ever returning to such an act of false accusation if you believe in itAnd Allah explains to you the verses that include the legal rulings and sermons, and Allah is All-Knowing of your actions, Wise in His law and management"
m-0704	Those who love to spread immorality among Muslims, such as slandering them with adultery or any bad saying, will have a painful punishment in this world by carrying out the prescribed punishment on them and other worldly calamities, and in the Hereafter they will have the punishment of Hell if they do not repent. And God alone knows their lies and knows the interests of His servants and the consequences of things, and you do not know that. And if it were not for the grace of God upon those who fell into the slanderous talk and His mercy towards them, and that God has great mercy on His believing servants in their immediate and future lives, He would not have explained these rulings and sermons, and He would have punished in the immediate life of those who disobeyed His command.
m-0705	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not follow the ways of Satan. And whoever follows the ways of Satan, he commands him to do ugly and reprehensible deeds. And were it not for the grace of Allah upon the believers and His mercy towards them, not one of them would ever be purified from the filth of his sin. But Allah, by His grace, purifies whom He wills. And Allah is Hearing of your words and Knowing of your intentions and your deeds. And let not those who are virtuous in religion and wealthy swear not to maintain relations with their poor and needy relatives and immigrants and to withhold support from them because of a sin they have committed. And let them overlook their wrongdoing and not punish them. Do you not love that Allah should overlook you? So overlook them. And Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful towards them. And in this is the encouragement to pardon and forgive even if they are met with wrongdoing.
m-0706	Those who accuse chaste, unaware, believing women of adultery, whose hearts have not considered it, are expelled from the mercy of Allah in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have a great punishment in the fire of Hell. This verse is evidence of the disbelief of whoever curses or accuses a wife of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) of evil. That punishment will be on the Day of Resurrection, the day when their tongues will bear witness against them as to what they have spoken, and their hands and feet will speak as to what they have done. On that day, Allah will give them their full recompense for their deeds in justice, and they will know in that great gathering that Allah is the manifest truth, that He is the truth, and His promise is true, and His threat is true, and everything in Him is true, and He does not wrong anyone by as much as an atom’s weight. Every evil person among men and women, and words and deeds, is appropriate for the evil person and is compatible with him, and every good person among men and women, and words and deeds, is appropriate for the good person and is compatible with him. The good men and women are innocent of the evil that the evil person accuses them of. They will have forgiveness from Allah that will take away their sins and a generous provision in Paradise.
m-0707	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you have asked permission of their inhabitants to enter and greeted them. The wording of that from the Sunnah is “As-salamu ‘alaykum.” Is it better for you to enter? Asking permission is better for you, so that you may remember by doing so the commands of Allah and obey him. If you do not find anyone in the houses of others, do not enter them until you find someone who gives you permission. If he does not give you permission, but rather says to you, “Go back,” then go back and do not insist, for going back then is purer for you, because a person has conditions that he does not like anyone to know about, and Allah is Knowing of what you do, and He will reward every worker according to his work. However, there is no blame on you for entering without permission houses that are not designated for the residence of specific people, but rather for those who need them to enjoy them, such as houses prepared as charity for the wayfarer on the roads of travelers and other facilities, for in them there are benefits and a need for those who enter them, and in asking permission there is hardship, and Allah knows your conditions, apparent and hidden.
m-0708	And tell the believing women to lower their gaze from what is not lawful for them of women and private parts and guard their private parts from what Allah has forbidden of adultery, sodomy, exposing private parts and the like. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do in what He commands them and forbids them. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze from what is not lawful for them of private parts and guard their private parts from what Allah has forbidden. And do not show their adornment to men, but strive to conceal it except for the outward garments that are customarily worn if there is nothing in that that invites temptation by it. And let them draw their head coverings over the openings of their chests, covering their faces to complete their covering. And do not show their hidden adornment except to their husbands when they see of them what no one else sees. And some of them, such as the face, neck, hands and forearms, are permissible for their fathers or the fathers of their husbands, or their sons or the sons of their husbands, or their brothers or the sons of their brothers or the sons of their sisters, or their Muslim women but not the disbelieving women or the slaves they own or the male followers. Those who have no interest or need for women, such as fools who follow others for food and drink only, or young children who have no knowledge of women’s private matters and in whom desire has not yet been felt. Women should not be struck when they walk with their feet so that they may hear the sound of their hidden adornments, such as anklets and the like. O believers, return to obeying God in what He has commanded you of these beautiful qualities and praiseworthy morals, and abandon the immoral morals and qualities of the people of ignorance, hoping that you will win the good of this world and the Hereafter.
m-0709	And marry, O believers, those who have no husband from among the free men and women and the righteous from among your male and female slaves. If he who desires to marry for the sake of chastity is poor, Allah will enrich him from His abundant provision. And Allah is Bountiful, Abundant in goodness, Great in bounty, Knowing of the conditions of His servants. And those who are unable to marry due to their poverty or otherwise, let them seek chastity from what Allah has forbidden until Allah enriches them from His bounty and makes marriage easy for them. And those who want to be freed from slaves, male and female, by contracting with their masters for some money to be paid to them, then their owners must contract with them for that if they know that they are good in terms of maturity, ability to earn a living, and righteousness in religion. And they must give them some of the money or reduce what they have been contracted for. And it is not permissible for you to force your female slaves to fornicate for the sake of money. How can that happen from you when they desire chastity and you refuse it? In this is the utmost denunciation of their ugly action. And whoever forces them to fornicate, then Allah, the Most High, is Forgiving to them after their compulsion, and the sin is upon the one who forced them. And indeed, We have sent down to you, O people, verses of the Qur’an as clear proofs of the truth and as examples of the news of previous nations, the believers and the disbelievers among them, and what happened to them and upon them, as an example and a lesson for you and an admonition by which whoever fears God and is wary of His punishment will be admonished.
m-0710	"Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. He manages the affairs therein and guides their people. He is the Light, and His veil is light. By it the heavens and the earth and what is in them are illuminated. The Book of Allah and His guidance are light from Him, the Exalted. Were it not for His light, the darknesses would have piled up one upon the other. The example of His light that guides to Him, which is faith and the Qur’an, is in the heart of the believer as a niche, which is a hole in a wall that does not pass through, in which is a lamp. The hole collects the light of the lamp so that it does not disperse. That lamp is in a glass as if, due to its clarity, it were a shining planet like pearls. The lamp is lit from the oil of a blessed tree, which is the olive tree. It is neither eastern only, so the sun does not reach it at the end of the day, nor western only, so the sun does not reach it at the beginning of the day. Rather, it is in the middle of a place on the earth, neither to the east nor to the west. Its oil, due to its clarity, almost glows by itself before the fire touches it. But when the fire touches it, it glows with a profound glow. Light upon light. It is a light from the shining of oil upon the light from the kindling of fire. That is the example of guidance that shines in the heart of the believer. Allah guides and grants success to follow the Qur’an whomever He wills. He sets forth examples for the people so that they may understand His examples and His wisdom. Allah is All-Knowing. All-Knowing, nothing is hidden from HimThis shining light in the mosques that Allah has ordered to raise their status and construction and to mention His name in them by reciting His Book, glorifying and praising Him, and other types of remembrance, in which He prays to Allah in the morning and eveningMen who are not distracted by trade or sale from remembering Allah, establishing prayer, and giving zakat to those who are entitled to it. They fear the Day of Resurrection, when hearts will fluctuate between hope for salvation and fear of destruction, and eyes will fluctuate, looking at what fate they will beSo that Allah may give them the reward of their best deeds and increase them from His grace by multiplying their good deeds. Allah provides for whom He wills without account, but rather He gives him a reward that his deeds cannot reach, without counting or measuring."
m-0711	And those who disbelieved in their Lord and denied His messengers, their deeds which they thought would benefit them in the Hereafter, such as maintaining family ties, freeing prisoners, and other things, are like a mirage, which is what is seen like water on flat ground at noon. A thirsty person thinks it is water, but when he comes to it, he does not find it. So the disbeliever thinks that his deeds will benefit him, but when the Day of Resurrection comes, he will not find any reward for them, and he will find God, the Most High, lying in wait for him, so He will fully repay him for his deeds. And God is swift in reckoning, so let not the ignorant be impatient for that promise, for it will inevitably come true. Or their deeds will be like darknesses in a deep sea, upon which is a wave, above which is another wave, and above it is a dense cloud, intense darkness, one upon another. If the observer puts out his hand, he cannot come close to seeing it because of the intensity of the darkness. So the disbelievers have accumulated upon them the darkness of polytheism, misguidance, and corruption of deeds. And whoever God has not given a light from His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet to guide him, then he has no guide.
m-0712	Did you not know, O Prophet, that to Allah is glorified whoever is in the heavens and the earth of the creatures and the birds with their wings spread in the sky glorifying their Lord? Every creature has been guided by Allah how to pray to Him and glorify Him. He, glory be to Him, is All-Knowing of what every worshipper and glorifier does. Nothing of it is hidden from Him, and He will reward them for that. To Allah alone belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He has authority over them, and to Him is the return on the Day of Resurrection. Did you not see that Allah, glory be to Him, drives the clouds to wherever He wills, then gathers them after they have dispersed, then makes them pile up and sends down rain from between them, and sends down hail from the clouds that resemble mountains in their greatness, and strikes with it whomever He wills of His servants and diverts it from whomever He wills of them according to His wisdom and decree? The light of that lightning in the clouds, due to its intensity, almost blinds those who look at it. Among the signs of Allah’s power, glory be to Him, is that He turns the night and the day by one coming after the other and their difference in length and shortness. Indeed in that is a sign that everyone who has insight will consider. And Allah, glory be to Him, created everything that moves on The earth is made of water, so water is the origin of its creation. Some of these animals crawl on their bellies, like snakes and the like. Some of them walk on two legs, like humans. Some of them walk on four legs, like animals and the like. God Almighty creates whatever He wills, and He is capable of all things.
m-0713	"We have sent down in the Qur’an clear signs guiding to the truth, and Allah guides and directs whomever He wills of His servants to the straight path, which is Islam.The hypocrites say, “We believe in Allah and in what the Messenger brought, and we obeyed their command.” Then groups of them turn away after that and do not accept the judgment of the Messenger. And those are not believers.And when they are called in their disputes to what is in the Book of Allah and to His Messenger to judge between them, at once a group of them turns away and does not accept the judgment of Allah and the judgment of His Messenger, even though it is the truth about which there is no doubt.And if the truth is on their side, then they come to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, obediently and submissively to his judgment, knowing that he judges with truth.Is the reason for their turning away the disease of hypocrisy in their hearts, or their doubt in the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, or is it their fear that the judgment of Allah and His Messenger may be unjust? No, they do not fear injustice, but the reason is that they are the wrongdoers and the wicked.as for the true believers, their habit when they are called to refer their disputes to the Book of Allah and the judgment of His Messenger is to accept the judgment and say, “We have heard what was said to us and we have obeyed whoever called us to that.” And those are the successful, the triumphant. And those who obey Allah and His Messenger in the commands and prohibitions and fear the consequences of disobedience and are wary of Allah’s punishment, these are the ones who will win the bliss in Paradise. And the hypocrites swore by Allah the most ardent of their efforts in the most solemn oaths, “If you command us, O Messenger, to go out for jihad with you, we will go out.” Say to them, “Do not swear falsely, for your obedience is known to be by the tongue only. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what you do and will reward you for it.” Say, O Messenger, to the people, “Obey Allah and obey the Messenger.” If they turn away, then the Messenger is only responsible for doing what he was commanded to do in conveying the message, and everyone is responsible for doing what they were charged with in compliance. If you obey him, you will be guided to the truth. And the Messenger is only responsible for conveying the message of his Lord clearly."
m-0714	Allah has promised victory to those among you who believe and do righteous deeds, that He will give them the land of the polytheists and make them successors therein, just as He did with their predecessors among the believers in Allah and His Messengers, and that He will make their religion, which He has chosen for them, which is Islam, a mighty and established religion, and that He will change their state from fear to security if they worship Allah alone and remain steadfast in obeying Him and do not associate anything with Him. And whoever disbelieves after that succession, security, empowerment, and complete authority and denies the blessings of Allah, then those are the ones who have gone beyond the obedience of Allah. And establish prayer completely and give zakah to those who are entitled to it and obey the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, hoping that Allah will have mercy upon you. Do not think that those who disbelieve can frustrate Allah on earth. Rather, He is able to destroy them and return them in the Hereafter to the Fire. The ugliness of this return and destiny is a general directive for the nation, even though the address in it is to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
m-0715	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, command your male and female slaves and free children under the age of puberty to ask permission when entering upon you during the three times of your private parts: before the dawn prayer because it is the time to get out of the clothes for sleeping and put on the clothes for wakefulness, and the time to take off the clothes for the afternoon siesta, and after the evening prayer because it is the time for sleeping. These three times are private parts for you and covering is less. As for other times, there is no blame if they enter without permission because they need to enter upon you, circling around you to serve you. And as Allah has explained to you the rules of asking permission, He explains to you His verses, His rulings, His proofs, and the laws of His religion. And Allah is Knowing of what is good for His creation, Wise in His management of their affairs. And if the children among you reach the age of puberty and are charged with the rulings of the law, then they must ask permission if they want to enter at all times, just as adults ask permission. And as Allah explains the etiquette of asking permission, Allah explains to you His verses. And Allah is Knowing of what is good for His servants, Wise in His legislation. And the old women who have stopped enjoying themselves and lusting because of their old age, should not covet men. For marriage and men do not covet them as well, then there is no blame on them if they put on some of their clothes like the cloak that is over the clothes, not showing or exposing their adornment, and wearing these clothes to cover and be modest is better for them, and Allah is Hearing of your words and Knowing of your intentions and deeds. There is no sin on those who have excuses, such as the blind, the lame, and the sick, for leaving obligatory matters that they are unable to do, such as jihad and the like, which depend on the sight of the blind or the safety of the lame or the health of the sick. And there is no blame on yourselves, O believers, if you eat from the houses of your children or from the houses of your fathers or mothers or brothers or sisters or paternal uncles or aunts or maternal uncles or maternal aunts or from the houses that you have been entrusted to guard in the absence of their owners with their permission or from the houses of friends. And there is no blame on you if you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, whether inhabited or uninhabited, let some of you greet one another with the greeting of Islam, which is: Peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings, or Peace be upon us and upon the righteous slaves of Allah, if There is no one who has made this greeting permissible by God, and it is blessed, it increases affection and love, it is good and beloved by the listener, and with such clarification God shows you the features of His religion and His verses so that you may understand them and act upon them.
m-0716	The true believers are those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law. If they were with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, on a matter that brought them together for the benefit of the Muslims, none of them should leave until they ask his permission. Those who ask your permission, O Prophet, are those who truly believe in Allah and His Messenger. If they ask your permission for some of their needs, then give permission to whomever you wish of those who asked permission to leave for an excuse, and ask Allah for forgiveness for them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of the sins of His repentant servants, Most Merciful to them. Do not say, O believers, when you call the Messenger of Allah, O Muhammad, or O Muhammad ibn Abdullah, as some of you say to one another. Rather, honor him and say, O Prophet of Allah, O Messenger of Allah. Allah may know the hypocrites who leave the Prophet’s gathering, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, secretly without his permission, seeking refuge with one another. So let those who disobey the command of the Messenger of Allah beware lest a trial or evil befall them or a painful and grievous punishment befall them in the Hereafter. Beware, whatever is in the heavens and the earth, in creation, dominion, and worship, belongs to Allah. His knowledge encompasses all that you are upon, and the Day when the servants will return to Him in the Hereafter. He informs them of their deeds and rewards them for them. God is All-Knowing of everything. Their deeds and conditions are not hidden from Him.
m-0717	The blessings of Allah are great, His bounties are many, and His attributes are perfect. Glory be to Him, the Most High, who sent down the Qur’an, the distinction between truth and falsehood, to His servant Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, to be a messenger to mankind and jinn, frightening them of the punishment of Allah. He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He has not taken a son, nor has He had a partner in His dominion. He is the One who created everything and proportioned it in a manner that suits it from creation, in accordance with what His wisdom requires, without any deficiency or defect.
m-0718	The polytheists of the Arabs took deities besides Allah that could not create anything, and Allah created them and created them, and they do not possess for themselves the power to repel harm or bring benefit, nor can they cause the living to die or revive the dead or raise any of the dead alive from their graves. The disbelievers in Allah said, “This Qur’an is nothing but a lie and a slander that Muhammad invented, and other people helped him in that.” They committed a terrible injustice and came up with a heinous lie, for the Qur’an is not something that a human being could invent. They said about the Qur’an, “It is the hadiths of the ancients written in their books, which Muhammad copied, and they are read to him morning and evening.” Say, O Messenger, to these disbelievers, “The One who sent down the Qur’an is Allah, whose knowledge encompasses what is in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is Forgiving to whoever repents from sins and transgressions, Merciful to them, as He did not hasten to punish them.”
m-0719	"The polytheists said, ""What is wrong with this one who claims to be the Messenger of Allah - meaning Muhammad - eating food like us and walking in the markets seeking sustenance? Why did Allah not send with him an angel to testify to his truthfulness or send down to him from the sky a treasure of wealth or have him have a great garden from whose fruit he could eat?"" And these wrongdoers and deniers said, ""You do not follow, O believers, except a man who has magic that has overcome his mind."" The polytheists said, ""What is wrong with this one who claims to be the Messenger of Allah - meaning Muhammad - eating food like us and walking in the markets seeking sustenance? Why did Allah not send with him an angel to testify to his truthfulness or send down to him from the sky a treasure of wealth or have him have a great garden from whose fruit he could eat?"" And these wrongdoers and deniers said, ""You do not follow, O believers, except a man who has magic that has overcome his mind?"" Look, O Messenger, how the deniers said about you those strange sayings that resemble parables in their strangeness in order to reach the point of denying you. Thus, they strayed far from the truth and could not find a way to it to correct the lies and slander they said about you. Greatness May God’s blessings and bounties be multiplied. If He wills, He will grant you, O Messenger, something better than what they wished for you. He has granted you in this world many gardens interspersed with rivers, and He has granted you great palaces therein."
m-0720	"They did not deny you because you eat food and walk in the markets, but they denied the Day of Resurrection and the recompense therein. And We have prepared for those who deny the Hour a blazing Fire that will burn with them.When the Fire sees these deniers on the Day of Resurrection from a distant place, they will hear the sound of its boiling and roaring from the intensity of its wrath upon them.And when they are thrown into a very narrow place in Hell, with their hands chained to their necks, they will call for their own destruction in order to be saved from it.It will be said to them, in despair, “Do not call for your destruction today just once, but many times, for that will only increase your grief, for there is no escape for you.”Say to them, O Messenger, “Is this Fire that has been described to you better or the Garden of Eternal Bliss that has been promised to those who fear the punishment of their Lord? It was a reward for them for their deeds and a destination to which they will return in the Hereafter.”For these obedient ones in Paradise, whatever they desire of the pleasures of bliss, their enjoyment therein is eternal. Their entry into it was from your Lord, O Messenger, a promise that is being fulfilled, that the righteous servants of God ask for, and God does not fail in His promise."
m-0721	And on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will gather the polytheists and what they used to worship besides Him, and He will say to these worshipped ones, “Did you mislead these servants of Mine from the path of truth and command them to worship you, or did they go astray from the path and worship you of their own accord?” The worshipped ones besides Allah will say, “Glory be to You, our Lord, for what these people did. It is not right that we should take other than You as allies and befriend them. But You gave enjoyment to these polytheists and their fathers with wealth and well-being in this world until they forgot Your remembrance and associated others with You. They were a people who were destroyed and overcome by misery and failure.” Then it will be said to the polytheists, “These people whom you worshipped have lied to you in your claim against them. So here you are, unable to repel the punishment from yourselves or to help them. And whoever associates others with Allah, wronging himself and worshipping other than Allah and dying in that state, Allah will punish him with a severe punishment.” And We did not send before you, O Messenger, any of Our messengers except that they were human beings who ate food and walked in the markets. And We made some of you, O people, for others as a trial and a test with guidance. And misguidance and wealth and poverty, health and sickness, will you be patient and do what God has enjoined upon you and thank Him so that your Master will reward you, or will you not be patient and deserve punishment? And ever is your Lord, O Messenger, Seeing of who is impatient or patient, and of who is ungrateful or thankful.
m-0722	"And those who do not expect to meet their Lord after their death, because of their denial of Him, say, “Why did the angels not come down to us to inform us that Muhammad is truthful, or we could see our Lord clearly so that he could inform us of his truthfulness in his message?” They have become arrogant and haughty, as they dared to say this and have transgressed the limits in their transgression and disbelief.On the Day when they will see the angels at the time of death, in the grave, and on the Day of Resurrection, in a manner other than that which they had proposed, not to give them glad tidings of Paradise, but to say to them, “Allah has made Paradise a forbidden place for you.”And We presented to them the manifestations of goodness and righteousness, and We made them in vain and useless, like scattered dust, which is what is seen in the light of the sun from a light dust. This is because work does not benefit in the Hereafter unless its doer has faith in Allah, sincerity towards Him, and following His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.the companions of Paradise on the Day of Resurrection will be better settled than the people of Hell, and will have better dwellings in Paradise, for their comfort will be complete and their bliss will not be tainted by any turbidity.And remember, O Messenger, that Day when the sky will split open and from its openings will appear thin white clouds, and Allah will send down The angels of the heavens will surround the creation on that Day, when the Day of Judgment will come, and Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, will come to decide the judgment between the servants, in a manner befitting His Majesty.The true kingship on this Day belongs to the Most Merciful alone, and none else. This Day will be very difficult for the disbelievers because of the punishment and painful torment that will befall them.And remember, O Messenger, the Day when the wrongdoer will bite his hands in regret and remorse, saying, “Oh, I wish I had accompanied the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and followed him in adopting Islam as a path to Paradise.” And he will regret, saying, “Oh, I wish I had not taken the disbeliever so-and-so as a friend, following him and loving him. This friend led me astray from the Qur’an after it had come to me.” And the accursed Satan is always a deserter to man. In these verses is a warning against befriending a bad companion, for it may be a reason for his companion to enter the Fire.And remember, O Messenger, the Day when the wrongdoer will bite his hands in regret and remorse, saying, “Oh, I wish I had accompanied the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and followed him in adopting Islam as a path to Paradise.” And he will regret, saying, “Oh, I wish I had not taken the disbeliever so-and-so as a friend.” And remember, O Messenger, the Day when the wrongdoer will bite his hands in regret and sorrow, saying, “Oh, I wish I had accompanied the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and followed him in adopting Islam as a path to Paradise.” And he will regretfully say, “Oh, I wish I had not taken the disbeliever, so-and-so, as a friend, whom I would follow and love. This friend has led me astray from the Qur’an after it came to me.” And the accursed Satan has always been a deserter to man. And in these verses there is a warning against befriending an evil companion, for it may be a reason for one’s companion to be thrown into Hell."
m-0723	"The Messenger said, complaining about what his people had done: “O Lord, my people have abandoned this Qur’an and deserted it, persisting in their turning away from it, neglecting to contemplate it, act upon it, and convey it.” This verse contains a great warning for those who abandon the Qur’an and do not act upon it.And just as We have made enemies for you, O Messenger, from among the criminals of your people, We have made for every prophet an enemy from among the criminals of his people. So be patient as they were patient. And sufficient is your Lord as a guide, a leader, and a helper to help you against your enemies. And in this is consolation for His Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace.And those who disbelieved said: “Why was the Qur’an not sent down to Muhammad all at once like the Torah, the Gospel, and the Psalms?” God Almighty said: “Thus have We sent it down in parts to strengthen your heart and increase your reassurance, so that you may understand it and bear it. And We have explained it with certainty and respite.”And the polytheists will not come to you, O Messenger, with an argument or a doubt except that We will bring you the true answer and the best explanation of it.Those are the disbelievers who will be dragged on their faces to Hell, and those are the worst of people in status and the furthest from the truth."
m-0724	"And We gave Moses the Torah and made with him his brother Aaron as a helper for him. Then We said to them, ""Go to Pharaoh and his people who denied the proofs of Our Lordship and Divinity."" So they went to them and called them to believe in Allah and obey Him and not associate partners with Him. But they denied them, so We destroyed them with a great destruction. And We drowned the people of Noah with the flood when they denied him. And whoever denies a messenger has denied all messengers. And We made their drowning a lesson for mankind. And We made for them and for those who followed their path in denial on the Day of Resurrection a painful punishment. And We destroyed 'Aad, the people of Hud, and Thamud, the people of Salih, and the companions of the well, and many nations between the people of Noah and 'Aad. And Thamud and the people of the Messenger, none knows them except Allah.and all the nations We showed them the arguments and made clear the evidence to them and removed the excuses from them, and yet they did not believe, so We destroyed them with a grievous punishment.And indeed, the polytheists of Mecca used to pass in their travels by the city of the people of Lot, which was the city of Sodom, which was destroyed by stones from the sky, but they did not take heed from it, rather they did not expect a return on the Day of Resurrection in which they would be punished."
m-0725	"And when these deniers see you, O Messenger, they will mock you, saying, ""Is this he who claims that Allah has sent him as a messenger to us? He was about to turn us away from the worship of our idols with the strength of his argument and his explanation, had we not remained steadfast in worshipping them?"" And they will know when they see what they deserve of punishment, who is more misguided in religion, he or Muhammad. Look, O Messenger, in amazement at the one who obeys his own desires as he obeys Allah. Will you be a guardian over him until you bring him back to faith? Or do you think that most of them hear the verses of Allah with contemplation or understand what is in them? They are not but like beasts in not benefiting from what they hear. Rather, they are even more astray in path than them."
m-0726	"Have you not seen how Allah extended the shadow from dawn to sunrise? Had He willed, He could have made it fixed and stable, and the sun would not remove it? Then We made the sun a sign by which His conditions are known. Then the shadow shrinks little by little. So whenever the sun rises higher, its decrease increases. That is evidence of Allah’s power and greatness, and that He alone is deserving of worship. And Allah is the One Who made the night a cover for you with its darkness just as clothing covers you. And He made sleep a rest for your bodies. And He made the day for you so that you may spread out on the earth and seek your livelihood. And He is the One Who sends the winds that carry the clouds, giving good tidings to the people of rain, as a mercy from Him. And We send down from the sky water by which to purify ourselves, that We may bring forth vegetation in a place where there is no vegetation, and revive the barren land after its death, and We water it. That water is from what We have created many of the livestock and people.And it is He who sends the winds that carry the clouds, giving good tidings to the people of rain, as a mercy from Him. And We send down from the sky water by which to purify ourselves, that We may bring forth vegetation in a place where there is no vegetation, so that the barren land may live after its death. And We give water to many of the livestock and people.And We have certainly sent down rain on one land rather than another, that those upon whom We have sent down rain may remember the favor of Allah upon them, and give thanks to Him, and that those who were prevented from it may remember, and hasten to repent to Allah, the Most High, the Most Great, that He may have mercy on them and give them water. But most of the people refused except in denial of Our favors upon them, as they say, “We have given rain because of such-and-such a star.”And if We willed, We could have sent to every city a warner, calling them to Allah, the Almighty, the Majestic, and warning them of His punishment. But We have made you, O Messenger, a messenger to all the people of the earth, and We have commanded you to convey this Qur’an to them, so do not obey the disbelievers in abandoning any of what you were sent with. Rather, exert your utmost effort in conveying the message, and strive against the disbelievers with this Qur’an with a great striving, without any slackness.And if We willed, We could have sent to every city a warner, calling them to Allah, the Almighty, the Majestic. And Allah is the One Who mixed the two seas, the fresh and palatable, and the salty and very salty, and placed between them a barrier that prevents each one of them from corrupting the other and preventing one from reaching the other. And He is the One Who created from the semen of man and woman male and female offspring, and from this arose kinship by blood and marriage. And your Lord is Able to create what He wills. Despite all these proofs of Allah’s power and His favor upon His creation, the disbelievers worship besides Allah that which neither benefits them if they worship Him nor harms them if they abandon His worship. And the disbeliever is an aid to Satan against his Lord by associating partners with Him in the worship of Allah, supporting him in his disobedience."
m-0727	"And We have not sent you, O Messenger, except as a bringer of good tidings to the believers of Paradise and a warner to the disbelievers of the Fire. Say to them, “I do not ask of you any reward for conveying the message, but whoever wants to be guided and follow the path of truth to his Lord and spend in His pleasure, I will not force you to do so, but it is better for yourselves.” And put your trust in Allah, who has all the meanings of perfect life, as befits His Majesty, who does not die and is free from the attributes of imperfection. Allah is sufficient as an expert in the sins of His creation. Nothing of them is hidden from Him, and He will hold them accountable for them and reward them for them. He who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days, then He established Himself on the Throne, that is, He rose and ascended in a manner befitting His Majesty. He is the Most Gracious, so ask, O Prophet, one who is well-informed about Him. He means by that His noble Self, for He is the One who knows His attributes, His greatness, and His majesty. No one among mankind knows Allah better or is more knowledgeable about Him than His servant and Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And when it is said to the disbelievers, “Prostrate to the Most Gracious and worship Him,” they say, “We do not know the Most Gracious. Should we prostrate to what you command us to prostrate to in obedience to your command?” And He increases them. Their call to prostrate to the Most Gracious is a departure from faith and aversion from HimThe blessings of the Most Gracious are great and His goodness is abundant, who made the great stars in the sky with their stations and made in it a sun that shines and a moon that illuminates And He is the One who made the night and the day alternate, one succeeding the other for whoever wants to take heed, including faith in the Manager and Creator, or wants to thank God Almighty for His blessings and favors"

And grant me good praise and a beautiful memory among those who come after me until the Day of Resurrection. And make me one of Your servants to whom You will inherit the delights of Paradise.” This is a supplication from Abraham, peace be upon him, that God would rescue his father from misguidance to guidance, so He would forgive him and forgive him, as Abraham had promised his father by supplicating for him. When it became clear to him that he would continue in disbelief and polytheism until he died, he disavowed him. And do not cause me to be humiliated on the Day when people will emerge from the graves for reckoning and recompense. The Day when neither wealth nor children will benefit any of the servants, except for he who comes to God with a heart that is sound from disbelief and hypocrisy. And viceAnd do not let humiliation befall me on the Day when people emerge from the graves for judgment and recompense, the Day when neither wealth nor children will benefit any of the servants, except for he who comes to Allah with a heart free from disbelief, hypocrisy and viceAnd do not let humiliation befall me on the Day when people emerge from the graves for judgment and recompense

One of them is believed in a word and adds to it more than a hundred lies.

And the poets, their poetry is based on falsehood and lies, and the misguided and deviant like them go along with them. Have you not seen, O Prophet, that they wander aimlessly like a wanderer, delving into every art of lying and falsehood, tearing apart honor, attacking lineages, and insulting chaste women, and that they say what they do not do, and they exaggerate in praising the people of falsehood. And they belittle the people of truth

Allah excepted from the poets those poets who were guided by faith, did righteous deeds, and frequently mentioned Allah, so they wrote poetry about the oneness of Allah, the Most High, and praising Him, the Most High, and defending His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and they spoke with wisdom, exhortation, and good manners They defended Islam by satirizing those who satirized it or satirized its Messenger in response to the infidel poets. Those who wronged themselves with polytheism and sins and wronged others by denying their rights or assaulting them or with false accusations will know which of the sources of evil and destruction they should return to. It is a place of evil. We ask God for safety and wellness."
m-0743	ٱ ... Confused are those who will have the worst punishment in this world - killing, captivity, humiliation and defeat - and they will be the most deprived of people in the Hereafter. And you, O Messenger, are receiving the Qur’an from God, the Wise in His creation and management, who encompasses all things in knowledge.
m-0744	"Remember the story of Moses when he said to his family on his way from Midian to Egypt, "I have seen a fire. I will bring you news from it that will guide us on the way, or I will bring you a flame of fire so that you may warm yourself from the cold." When Moses reached the fire, God called him and informed him that this was a place that God had sanctified and blessed, so He made it a place to speak to Moses and send him, and that God had blessed those in the fire and those around it from the angels. God, the Lord of creation, is glorified above that which is not befitting of Him. O Moses, I am God, the only one worthy of worship, the Almighty, the Victorious in My vengeance against My enemies, the Wise in the management of My creation. Throw down your staff. So he threw it down and it became a snake. When he saw it moving lightly like a swift snake, he turned and fled and did not return to it. God reassured him by saying, "O Moses, do not fear. Those whom I have sent with My message do not fear in My sight. But whoever transgresses the limit with a sin and then repents and exchanges the goodness of repentance for the ugliness of the sin, then I am Forgiving of him, Merciful to him. So let no one despair of God's mercy and forgiveness. Put your hand into your bosom and it will come out white as snow, without leprosy." Nine miracles, which are the hand, the staff, the years, the decrease in fruits, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, and the blood, to support you in your message to Pharaoh and his people, for they were a people who disbelieved in the command of God. When Moses came to the fire, God called him and informed him that this was a place that God had sanctified and blessed, so He made it a place to speak to Moses and send him, and that God had blessed those in the fire and those around it from the angels, and to glorify God, the Lord of creation, from what is not befitting of Him, O Moses, indeed I am God, the only one worthy of worship, the Almighty, the Victorious in My vengeance against My enemies, the Wise in the management of My creation.

So when these miracles came to them, clear and evident, by which whoever looked at them could see the truth of what they indicated, they said, “This is clear and evident magic.” And they denied the nine miracles, which were clear evidence of the truth of Moses’ prophethood and the truth of his call, and they denied with their tongues that they were from God, although they were certain of them in their hearts, an assault on the truth and arrogance in acknowledging it. So look, O Messenger, at what was the fate of those who disbelieved in the signs of God and corrupted the earth, when God drowned them in the sea. And in that is a lesson for those who take heed."
m-0745	"And We gave David and Solomon knowledge, so they acted upon it and said, ""Praise be to Allah, who has favored us with this over many of His believing servants."" And in the verse is evidence of the honor of knowledge and the elevation of its people. Solomon inherited from his father David in prophecy, knowledge, and kingship. Solomon said to his people, ""O people, we have learned and understood the speech of birds, and we have been given of everything that need calls for. Indeed, what Allah has given us is the clear favor that distinguishes us from others."" And he gathered for Solomon his soldiers from the jinn, humans, and birds in a march for them, so despite their great number, they were not neglected. Rather, each species had someone to bring them back, the first to the last, so that they would all stand in order. Until, when they reached the Valley of the Ants, an ant said, ""O ants, enter your dwellings, lest Solomon and his soldiers destroy you,"" while they did not know that. So he smiled, laughing at the words of this ant, because of its understanding and guidance to warn the ants, and he sensed the blessing of Allah upon him, so he turned to Him, calling out, ""O my Lord, inspire me and guide me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and my parents, and to do righteous work that pleases You from me, and admit me by Your mercy into The bliss of Your Paradise with Your righteous servants whose deeds You are pleased with
Until, when they reached the Valley of the Ants, an ant said, “O ants, enter your dwellings, lest Solomon and his soldiers destroy you while they do not know about it.” So he smiled, laughing at the words of this ant because of its understanding and guidance to the warning of the ants, and he sensed the blessing of God upon him, so he turned to Him, supplicating, “O my Lord, inspire me and grant me success to be grateful for Your blessing which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and to do righteous work that pleases You from me, and admit me by Your mercy into the bliss of Your Paradise with Your righteous servants whose deeds You are pleased with.”"
m-0746	And Solomon inspected the condition of the birds subservient to him and the condition of those that were absent. And he had a well-known, distinguished hoopoe, but he did not find it. So he said, “What is the matter with me that I do not see the hoopoe that I know? Has he concealed it from me? Or has he been absent from me, and I did not see him because of his absence?” And when it became clear that he was absent, he said, “I will surely punish this hoopoe with a severe punishment for his absence, as a discipline for him, or I will slaughter him as a punishment for what he did when he neglected what he was subservient to, or let him bring me a clear proof in which there is an excuse for his absence.” And the hoopoe remained for a short time, then he came back. So Solomon rebuked him for his absence and his staying behind, and the hoopoe said to him, “I know what you did not know about the matter in a comprehensive manner, and I have come to you from the city of Sheba in Yemen with news of a serious matter, and I am certain of it. I found a woman ruling the people of Sheba, and she has been given everything from the causes of this world, and she has a throne of great stature on which she sits to manage her kingdom.” I found her and her people worshipping the sun, turning away from the worship of God, and Satan made their evil deeds that they were doing seem good to them, so he turned them away from believing in God and His Oneness, so they are not guided to God and His Oneness and worship of Him alone. Satan made that seem good to them so that they would not prostrate to God, who brings forth what is hidden and concealed in the heavens and the earth, such as rain, plants, and other things, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. God, there is no god worthy of worship except Him, Lord of the Mighty Throne. Satan made that seem good to them so that they would not prostrate to God, who brings forth what is hidden and concealed in the heavens and the earth, such as rain, plants, and other things, and He knows what you conceal and what you reveal. God, there is no god worthy of worship except Him, Lord of the Mighty Throne. Solomon said to the hoopoe, “We will reflect on the news that you have brought us. You have spoken the truth.” Solomon said to the hoopoe, “We will contemplate the news you have brought us. Are you telling the truth in this or are you lying? Go with this letter of mine to the people of Sheba and give it to them. Then move away from them, close enough to hear their speech and observe what they say.”
m-0747	"The hoopoe went and threw the letter to the queen, so she read it and gathered the nobles of her people and heard her say to them, ""A letter of great importance has reached me from a person of great importance."" Then she explained what was in it and said, ""It is from Solomon and it begins with, 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Do not be arrogant and do not be haughty about what I have called you to, but come to me, submitting to God in monotheism and obedience, submitting to Him."" Then she explained what was in it and said, ""It is from Solomon and it begins with, 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Do not be arrogant and do not be haughty about what I have called you to, but come to me, submitting to God in monotheism and obedience, submitting to Him."" She said, ""O nobles, advise me in this matter. I would not decide on a matter except in your presence and with your advice."" They responded to her, ""We are people of strength in numbers and equipment, and people of courage and bravery in the intensity of war. The matter is entrusted to you, and you are the one with the opinion, so consider what you command us to do, for we are listening to your command and obedient to you."" She said, warning them against confronting Solomon with hostility and explaining to them the evil consequences of fighting, ""If you do not accept this, then you will be rewarded."" Kings, when they enter a town by force and oppression, destroy it and humiliate its honorable people, kill and take captives. This is their constant and established custom to make people fear them. I am sending to Solomon and his people a gift containing precious wealth, to treat him with it and await what the messengers will bring back. She said, warning them against confronting Solomon with hostility and explaining to them the evil consequences of fighting: When kings enter a town by force and oppression, they destroy it and humiliate its honorable people, kill and take captives. This is their constant and established custom to make people fear them. I am sending to Solomon and his people a gift containing precious wealth, to treat him with it and await what the messengers will bring back. When the queen’s messenger brought the gift to Solomon, he said, denouncing it and speaking of God’s blessings upon him, “Do you provide me with money to please me? What God has given me of prophethood, kingship and abundant wealth is better and more excellent than what He has given you. Rather, you are the ones who rejoice in the gift that is given to you because you are worthy of it.” Boasting of the world and showing off with it
And Solomon, peace be upon him, said to the messenger of the people of Sheba, “Go back to them, for by God we will come to them with soldiers that they will not be able to resist or confront, and we will expel them from their land, humiliated and disgraced, if they do not submit to the religion of God alone and abandon the worship of anyone other than Him.”"
m-0748	"Solomon said, addressing those whom Allah had subjected to him from among the jinn and mankind, ""Which of you will bring me the throne of her great kingdom before they come to me in submission and obedience?"" A strong, powerful rebel from among the jinn said, ""I will bring it to you before you rise from this seat of yours. And indeed, I am strong enough to bear it, trustworthy in what is in it. I will bring it as it is, without diminishing anything from it or changing it."" He who had knowledge of the Scripture said, ""I will bring you this throne before your eyelids recede when you move to look at something."" So Solomon gave him permission. So he called upon Allah and the throne was brought. When Solomon saw it present before him, fixed by him, he said, ""This is from the bounty of my Lord, who created me and created the entire universe, to test me. Will I be grateful thereby in recognition of His favor upon me, or will I be ungrateful by neglecting to be grateful?"" And whoever is grateful to Allah for His favors, then the benefit of that returns to him. And whoever denies the favor and neglects to be grateful, then indeed, my Lord is independent of His gratitude, Generous. He bestows His goodness in this world on the grateful and the ungrateful. Then He will hold them accountable and reward them in the Hereafter. Solomon said to those with him, ""Change the throne of her kingdom on which she sits to a state that you will not recognize when you see it, so that we may see if you are guided to its recognition."" Or are you among those who are not guided?

So when the Queen of Sheba came to Solomon in his council, she was asked, “Is this your throne?” She said, “It resembles it.” So it became clear to Solomon that she had been right in her answer, and she knew the power of God and the truth of Solomon’s prophethood, peace be upon him. He said, “And we were given knowledge of God and His power before her, and we were obedient to the command of God, following the religion of Islam.”

And what prevented her from worshipping God alone was what she used to worship besides God Almighty. She was a disbeliever and grew up among a people of disbelievers and continued in their religion. Otherwise, she had the intelligence and insight to know the truth from falsehood, but false beliefs take away the insight of the heart.

She was told to enter the palace, and its courtyard was of glass with water underneath it. When she saw it, she thought it was water with waves moving, and she uncovered her legs to wade in the water. Solomon said to her, “It is a smooth courtyard of clear glass and the water is underneath it.” So she realized the greatness of Solomon’s kingdom and said, “My Lord, I have wronged myself in what I was doing of polytheism.” She submitted, following Solomon, entering the religion of the Lord of the worlds, all of them."
m-0749	"And We sent to Thamud their brother Salih, [saying], “Believe in the Oneness of Allah and do not make with Him another god.” But when Salih came to them, calling them to the Oneness of Allah and to worship Him alone, his people became two groups, one of whom believed in him and the other disbelieved in his call, each of them claiming that the truth was with him. Salih said to the disbelieving group, “Why do you hasten to disbelieve and do evil deeds that will bring you punishment, and delay faith and doing good deeds that will bring you reward? Why do you not seek forgiveness from Allah first and repent to Him, hoping that you will be shown mercy?” Salih’s people said to him, “We have a bad omen about you and those with you who have entered your religion.” Salih said to them, “Whatever good or evil befalls you, Allah has decreed for you and will repay you for it. Rather, you are a people who are tested by prosperity and adversity, good and evil.” In the city of Salih, which is Al-Hijr, located in the northwest of the Arabian Peninsula, there were nine men whose business was to spread corruption on earth, without any mingling of goodness with it. These nine said to each other, “They will swear by Allah that each one of them will swear to the others, ‘We will come to Salih suddenly at night and kill him and his family, then we will say to the heir of the blood, Of his relatives, we were present at their killing, and we are truthful in what we said.

And they plotted this trick to destroy Salih and his family, as a plot from them, but We aided Our Prophet Salih, peace be upon him, and seized them with the punishment by surprise, and they did not expect Our plot against them as a reward for their plot.

So look, O Messenger, with a look of consideration at the consequence of the treachery of these people towards their Prophet Salih. We destroyed them and their people, all of them.

Those are their dwellings, empty, with none of them in them. God destroyed them because of their injustice to themselves through polytheism and the denial of their Prophet. Indeed in that destruction and devastation is a lesson for a people who know what We did to them. This is Our way with those who deny the messengers.

And We saved Salih and the believers in him from what befell Thamud of destruction, who were fearing the punishment of God through their faith."
m-0750	"And remember Lot, when he said to his people, ""Do you commit the most hideous deed while you know its ugliness? Is it that you approach men from behind out of lust instead of women? Rather, you are a people who are ignorant of Allah's right over you?"" Thus you have disobeyed His command and disobeyed His Messenger with your ugly deed, which no one in the worlds has ever done before you?

And remember Lot, when he said to his people, ""Do you commit the most hideous deed while you know its ugliness? Is it that you approach men from behind out of lust instead of women? Rather, you are a people who are ignorant of Allah's right over you."" Thus you have disobeyed His command and disobeyed His Messenger with your ugly deed, which no one in the worlds has ever done before you?

The people of Lot had no answer to him except to say to one another, ""Expel the family of Lot from your city. Indeed, they are people who abstain from approaching males."" They said that to them in mockery of them.

So We saved Lot and his family from the punishment that would befall the people of Lot, except for his wife; We destined her to be among those remaining in the punishment until she perished with The lost because she was an aid to her people in their ugly actions, pleased with them. And We rained down upon them from the sky destructive stones of clay. So ugly was the rain of the warners against whom the proof was established."
m-0751	"Say, O Messenger, praise and thanks be to Allah, and peace and security from Him upon His servants whom He has chosen for His message. Then ask the polytheists of your people, is Allah, who possesses benefit and harm, better, or what they associate with Him, who possesses neither benefit nor harm for himself or for others? And ask them, who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you from the sky water, and brought forth thereby gardens of beautiful appearance, whose trees you could not have produced had Allah not sent down water upon you from the sky? Indeed, His worship, glory be to Him, is the truth, and the worship of anything other than Him is falsehood. Is there a deity with Allah who did these actions so that He would be worshipped along with him and associated with him? Rather, these polytheists are a people who deviate from the path of truth and faith, so they equate others with Allah in worship and glorification? Is the worship of what you associate with your Lord better, or the One who made for you the earth a stable place and made rivers in its midst and made for it mountains as fixed places and placed between the fresh and salty seas a barrier so that one does not spoil the other? Is there a deity with Allah who did that so that you associate with Him in your worship? Rather, most of these polytheists do not know the extent of Allah’s greatness, so they associate with Him. Imitation and injustice
Is the worship of what you associate with God better, or the one who answers the distressed when he calls upon Him and removes the evil that has befallen him and makes you successors to those who preceded you on earth? Is there a deity with God who bestows these blessings upon you? Little do you remember and consider. Therefore you have associated with God other than Him in His worship
Is the worship of what you associate with God better, or the one who guides you in the darknesses of the land and sea when you go astray and the paths become dark to you, and who sends the winds as good tidings with which He has mercy on His servants, of rain that revives the dead land? Is there a deity with God who does any of that for you so that you call upon Him instead of Him? God is exalted and sanctified above what they associate with Him.
And ask them: Who creates creation and then annihilates it when He wills and then restores it? And who provides for you from the sky by sending down rain and from the earth by growing crops and other things? Is there a deity other than God who does that? Say: Bring your proof if you are truthful in your claim that God Almighty has a partner in His kingdom and worship
Say, O Messenger, to them: No one in the heavens or on the earth knows what God has kept to Himself of the unseen, nor They do not know when they will be resurrected from their graves when the Hour comes. Rather, their knowledge is complete in the Hereafter, so they are certain of the Hereafter and what is in it of terrors when they witness it, and they were in doubt about it in this world, rather their insights were blind to it. Say, O Messenger, to them, no one in the heavens or on the earth knows what Allah has kept to Himself of the unseen. Nor do they know when they will be resurrected from their graves when the Hour comes. Rather, their knowledge is complete in the Hereafter, so they are certain of the Hereafter and what is in it of terrors when they witness it, and they were in doubt about it in this world, rather their insights were blind to it."
m-0752	"And those who denied the Oneness of God said, ""Shall we and our fathers be resurrected alive in our form after our death after we have become dust?""

We were promised this resurrection before, we and our fathers, but we did not see the truth of it and we did not believe in it. This promise is nothing but what the ancients wrote of lies in their books and invented.

Say, O Messenger, to these deniers, ""Travel through the land and look at the dwellings of those who were before you of the criminals. How was the end of those who denied the messengers? God destroyed them for their denial. And God will do to you the same as they did if you do not believe.""

And do not grieve over the polytheists' turning away from you and their denial of you, and do not let your breast be constricted by their plotting against you, for God is your supporter against them.

And the polytheists of your people say, O Messenger, when will this promise of punishment that you and your followers are threatening us with come true if you are truthful in what you are threatening us with?

Say to them, O Messenger, ""Perhaps some of that which you are hastening of God's punishment has drawn near to you.""

And your Lord is full of favor to the people in not hastening their punishment. For their disobedience to Him and their disbelief in Him, but most of them do not thank Him for that, so they believe in Him and sincerely worship Him.

And indeed, your Lord knows what the hearts of His creation conceal and what they reveal.

And there is nothing hidden from the sight of creation in the heavens and the earth except that it is in a clear book with God. That book has encompassed all that was and what will be."
m-0753	"This Qur’an tells the Children of Israel the truth about most of the things in which they differed.

And this Qur’an is a guidance from misguidance and a mercy from punishment for whoever believes in it and is guided by its guidance.

Indeed, your Lord will judge between those who differed among the Children of Israel and others with His judgment concerning them. He will take revenge on the wrongdoer and reward the doer of good. He is the Exalted in Might, the Victorious. His judgment, the All-Knowing, is not rejected. So truth is not confused with falsehood for Him."
m-0754	So, O Messenger, rely on Allah in all your affairs and trust in Him, for He is sufficient for you. You are on the clear truth about which there is no doubt. O Messenger, you cannot hear the truth from one whose heart Allah has sealed and killed, nor can your call be heard from one whose hearing Allah has deafened to hearing the truth when they turn away from you. For the deaf person does not hear the call when he is coming, so how about when he turns away from it and retreats? O Messenger, you cannot guide from misguidance one whom Allah has blinded from guidance and right conduct. You cannot hear except those who believe in Our verses, for they are Muslims, obedient, and responsive to what you have called them to.
m-0755	And if the punishment is due to their persistence in sins and tyranny and their turning away from Allah’s law and judgment until they become among the worst of His creation, We will bring forth for them from the earth at the end of time a sign from the major signs of the Hour, which is the beast that will tell them that the people who denied the resurrection were not believing in the Qur’an and Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his religion, nor acting. And on the Day of Resurrection We will gather from every nation a group of those who deny Our proofs and arguments, the first of them will be detained by the last of them so that they will all gather, then they will be driven to the reckoning. Until when there comes from every nation a group of those who deny Our signs and they gather, Allah will say, “Did you deny My signs that I sent down to My messengers and the signs that I established as evidence of My Oneness and My entitlement to worship alone, and you did not comprehend their falsehood until you turned away from them and denied them, or what were you doing?” And the word of punishment was due to them because of their injustice and denial, so they do not utter an argument with which to repel from themselves the evil punishment that has befallen them. Until when there comes from every nation a group of those who deny By Our signs, then they gathered together. Allah said, “Did you deny My signs which I sent down to My messengers and the signs which I established as evidence of My Oneness and My deservingness alone to be worshipped, and you did not comprehend their falsehood until you turned away from them and denied them? Or what were you doing?” And the word of punishment was justified against them because of their injustice and denial, so they do not utter an argument to defend themselves from the evil punishment that has befallen them. Have these deniers of Our signs not seen that We have made the night for them to rest in and sleep, and the day for them to see in, to strive for their livelihood? Indeed, in their arrangement is evidence for a people who believe in the perfection of Allah’s power and His Oneness and the greatness of His blessings. And remember, O Messenger, the Day when the Angel will blow the trumpet, and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be terrified with intense terror from the terror of the blast, except for those whom Allah has exempted from terror, whom He has honored and protected from terror. And all creatures will come to their Lord, humbled and obedient. And you will see the mountains, thinking they are standing still, while they are moving rapidly, like the broken clouds that the winds move. This is from the making of Allah who He created everything well and perfected it. God is All-Knowing of what His servants do, good and evil, and He will reward them for that.
m-0756	"Whoever brings the Oneness of Allah, faith in Him, worshipping Him alone, and doing righteous deeds on the Day of Resurrection, will have a great reward from Allah that is better than that and more excellent, which is Paradise, and they will be safe on the Day of Greatest Terror. 

Whoever brings polytheism and evil, reprehensible deeds, their recompense will be that Allah will throw them on their faces into the Fire on the Day of Resurrection, and it will be said to them, as a rebuke, “Are you being recompensed except for what you used to do in the world?” Say, O Messenger, to the people, “I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city, which is Mecca, who has forbidden His creation to shed unlawful blood therein, or to wrong anyone therein, or to hunt its game, or to cut down its trees, and to Him belongs all things. I have been commanded to worship Him alone, without anyone else, and I have been commanded to be among those who submit to His command and hasten to obey Him, and to recite the Qur’an to the people. Whoever is guided by what is in it and follows what I have brought, then the best of that and his recompense is for himself. Whoever strays from the truth, say, O Messenger, “I am only a warner to you of the torment and punishment of Allah if you do not believe.” Then I am one of the messengers who warned their people, and it is not in my hands. Of guidance is something
Say, O Messenger, to the people, I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city, which is Mecca, who has forbidden His creation to shed unlawful blood therein, or to wrong anyone therein, or to hunt its game, or to cut down its trees. And to Him belongs all things, glory be to Him. And I have been commanded to worship Him alone, without anyone else, and I have been commanded to be among those who submit to His command and hasten to obey Him, and to recite the Qur’an to the people. So whoever is guided by what is in it and follows what I have brought, then the best of that is for himself, and his reward is for himself. And whoever strays from the truth, then say, O Messenger, I am only a warner to you of the punishment and chastisement of Allah if you do not believe. I am one of the messengers who warned their people, and I have no hand in guidance.
Say, O Messenger, the beautiful praise of Allah. He will show you His signs in yourselves and in the heaven and the earth, and you will recognize them with a knowledge that will guide you to the truth and make falsehood clear to you. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do, and He will reward you for that."
m-0757	"TA SIM The speech on the disconnected letters was previously mentioned at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

These are the verses of the Qur’an that I have revealed to you, O Messenger, explaining everything that the servants need in their worldly life and their afterlife

We relate to you the news of Moses and Pharaoh in truth for a people who believe in this Qur’an and believe that it is from Allah and act according to His guidance

Indeed, Pharaoh was arrogant and transgressed in the land and divided its people into separate groups. He oppressed a group of them, and they were the Children of Israel. He slaughtered their sons and enslaved their women. Indeed, he was of the corrupters on the land

And We desired to bestow favor upon those whom Pharaoh oppressed in the land and make them leaders in goodness and callers to it and make them inherit the land after the destruction of Pharaoh and his people

And to establish them in the land and make Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers see from this oppressed group what they feared of their destruction and the loss of their kingdom and their expulsion from their homes at the hands of a newborn from the Children of Israel"
m-0758	"And We inspired the mother of Moses when she gave birth to him and feared that Pharaoh would slaughter him as he slaughtered the sons of the Children of Israel, to nurse him in peace and security. Then if you fear that his affair will be known, put him in a box and throw him into the Nile without fear of Pharaoh and his people killing him and without grieving over his separation. Indeed, We are returning your son to you and sending him as a messenger. So she put him in a box and threw him into the Nile. Pharaoh’s helpers found him and took him. The consequence of that was that Allah made him an enemy and a source of grief to them. So their destruction was at his hand. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their helpers were sinful and polytheists. And We inspired the mother of Moses when she gave birth to him and feared that Pharaoh would slaughter him as he slaughtered the sons of the Children of Israel, to nurse him in peace and security. Then if you fear that his affair will be known, put him in a box and throw him into the Nile without fear of Pharaoh and his people killing him and without grieving over his separation. Indeed, We are returning your son to you and sending him as a messenger. So she put him in a box and threw him into the Nile. Pharaoh’s helpers found him and took him. The consequence of that was that Allah made him an enemy and a grief to them, so their destruction was at his hand. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their helpers were sinful and polytheists.

And Pharaoh's wife said to Pharaoh, ""This child will be a source of joy for me and for you. Do not kill him, for we may gain from him something better, or we may adopt him as a son."" And Pharaoh and his people did not realize that their destruction was at his hand.

And the heart of Moses' mother became empty of everything in this world except the concern for Moses and his remembrance. She was about to reveal that he was her son, had We not strengthened her, so she was patient and did not reveal him, so that she would be among the believers in the promise of Allah, certain of it.

And Moses' mother said to his sister when she threw him into the river, ""Follow the traces of Moses, how will he be treated?"" So she followed his traces and saw him from a distance, and Pharaoh's people did not know that she was his sister and that she was following his news.

And We forbade Moses from nursing mothers to suckle from them before We returned him to his mother. His sister said, ""Shall I direct you to a family who will raise him well and nurse him, and who are compassionate toward him?"" So they agreed to that.

So We returned Moses to his mother so that her eye would be comforted by him, and We fulfilled her promise to her. By the promise when he returned to her safe from the killing of Pharaoh, and do not grieve over his separation, and know that the promise of God is true in what He promised her of returning him to her and making him one of the messengers. Indeed, God does not fail in His promise, but most of the polytheists do not know that the promise of God is true."
m-0759	When Moses reached the peak of his strength and his mind was perfected, We gave him wisdom and knowledge by which he could recognize the legal rulings. And as We rewarded Moses for his obedience and goodness, We reward those who are best among Our servants. Moses entered the city in secret at a time when its people were unaware. He found two men fighting in it, one of them from the people of Moses from the Children of Israel and the other from the people of Pharaoh. The one from the people of Moses sought victory over the one from his enemy, so Moses struck him with the palm of his hand and he died. Moses said when he killed him, “This is from the instigation of Satan, for he stirred up my anger until I struck this man, and he perished. Indeed, Satan is an enemy to the son of Adam, misleading from the path of guidance.” His enmity is apparent. This action of Moses, peace be upon him, was before the prophethood. Moses said, “My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself by killing the soul which you did not command me to kill, so forgive me for that sin.” So Allah forgave him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of the sins of His servants, Merciful to them. Moses said, “My Lord, since You have bestowed upon me repentance and forgiveness and many blessings, I will never be an aid to anyone in his disobedience and crime.” So Moses became in the city of Pharaoh, fearful and awaiting news of what the people were talking about. In his affair and the affair of his victim, he saw his companion yesterday fighting another Copt and asking him for victory. Moses said to him, “You are indeed very misguided and clearly astray.” When Moses wanted to strike the Copt, he said, “Do you want to kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant on earth, and you do not want to be among those who make peace between people.”
m-0760	A man came running from the end of the city and said, “O Moses, the nobles of Pharaoh’s people are plotting to kill you and consulting with one another. So leave this city. I am one of your sincere advisors who are concerned about you.” So Moses left Pharaoh’s city, fearful and waiting for the pursuer to catch up with him and seize him. He called upon God to save him from the wrongdoing people.
m-0761	"When Moses went to the land of Midian and left the authority of Pharaoh, he said, ""Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the best way to Midian."" When he reached the water of Midian, he found a group of people watering their livestock. He found two women apart from the people, holding back their sheep from the water because of their inability and weakness to compete with the men. They waited until the people's livestock left, then they watered their livestock. When Moses, peace be upon him, saw them, he felt sorry for them and said, ""What is the matter with you?"" They said, ""We cannot compete with the men, nor can we water until the people have watered, and our father is an old man who cannot water his livestock because of his weakness and age."" So Moses watered the livestock of the two women, then he turned to the shade of a tree and took shelter under it. He said, ""My Lord, indeed I am in need of whatever good you bring me, such as food."" And he was very hungry. Then one of the two women for whom he had watered came walking toward him shyly and said, ""My father invites you to give you the reward for having watered our livestock."" So Moses went with her to her father. When he came to her father, he told him his story. With Pharaoh and his people. Her father said to him, ""Do not fear. You have escaped from the unjust people, who are Pharaoh and his people, since they have no authority in our land."" One of the two women said to her father, ""O my father, hire him to tend your livestock. The best one you can hire for herding is the one who is strong and trustworthy, and you do not fear his betrayal in what you entrust him with."" The old man said to Moses, ""I want to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine on the condition that you be my hired hand in tending my livestock for eight years in return for that. If you complete ten years, that will be a favor from you. I do not want to make it difficult for you by making it ten. You will find me, God willing, among the righteous in good company and fulfilling what you said."" Moses said, ""That which you said stands between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I spend in work, I will have fulfilled my obligation to you, so I will not ask for more than that. God is the Guardian and Preserver of what we say. He watches over us and knows what we have agreed upon."""
m-0762	When the Prophet of God, Moses, peace be upon him, had fulfilled his companion’s term of ten years, which was the most complete of the two terms, and he traveled with his family to Egypt, he saw a fire on the side of the mountain. Moses said to his family, “Wait a minute and wait. I have seen a fire. Perhaps I will bring you some news from it, or I will bring you a flame of fire that you may warm yourselves by.” When Moses came to the fire, God called to him from the side of the valley to the right of Moses, in the blessed spot, from the side of the tree, “O Moses, indeed I am God, Lord of the worlds. Throw down your staff.” So Moses threw it down, and it became a serpent, darting about. When Moses saw it writhing as if it were a genie of snakes, he turned away fleeing from it and did not turn back out of fear. Then his Lord called to him, “O Moses, come to Me and fear not. Indeed, you are among those who are safe from every harm.” When Moses came to the fire, God called to him from the side of the valley to the right of Moses, in the blessed spot, from the side of the tree, “O Moses, indeed I am God, Lord of the worlds. Throw down your staff.” So Moses threw it down, and it became a serpent, darting about. When Moses saw it writhing as if it were a genie of snakes, he turned away. Fleeing from it and did not turn back from fear, then his Lord called to him, “O Moses, come to Me and do not fear. Indeed, you are among those who are safe from every harm.” Put your hand into the opening of your shirt and bring it out, it will come out white as snow, without disease or leprosy. And close your hand to you so that you may be safe from fear. These two things that I have shown you, O Moses, of the staff turning into a snake and making your hand white, shining, without disease or leprosy, are two signs from your Lord to Pharaoh and the nobles of his people. Indeed, Pharaoh and his chiefs were a disbelieving people.
m-0763	"Moses said, ""My Lord, I have killed a person from among Pharaoh's people, and I fear that they will kill me. And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I in speech. So send him with me as a helper who will confirm me and explain to them what I say to them. I fear that they will deny me when I say to them, 'Indeed, I have been sent to them.'"" God said to Moses, ""We will strengthen you through your brother, and We will make for you both a proof against Pharaoh and his people, so that they will not harm you. You, Moses and Aaron, and those who believe in you, are the victorious ones over Pharaoh and his people because of Our signs and what they indicate of the truth."""
m-0764	"And when Moses came to Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our proofs and arguments, bearing witness to the truth of what Moses brought from his Lord, they said to Moses, ""This that you have brought us is nothing but magic that you have fabricated falsely and in vain. We have never heard of this to which you call us among our ancestors who passed before us."" And Moses said to Pharaoh, ""My Lord knows best who is right among us, who has brought guidance from Him, and who has the good end in the Hereafter. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not attain what they seek."" And Pharaoh said to the nobles of his people, ""O chiefs, I do not know of any god for you other than me who deserves worship. So, O Haman, kindle for me a fire upon the clay until it hardens, and build for me a lofty building that I may see the God of Moses whom he worships and calls to worship. Indeed, I think that he is one of the liars in what he says."" And Pharaoh and his soldiers became arrogant in the land of Egypt without right, from believing in Moses and following him in what he called them to, and they thought that after their death they would not be resurrected. So We seized Pharaoh and his soldiers and threw them all into the sea and drowned them, so see. O Messenger, how was the end of those who wronged themselves and disbelieved in their Lord?

And We made Pharaoh and his people leaders to the Fire, to be followed by the people of disbelief and immorality, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped. This is because of their disbelief and their denial of the Messenger of their Lord and their insistence on that.

And We pursued Pharaoh and his people in this world with disgrace and wrath from Us upon them, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among those whose actions are abhorrent and who are removed from the mercy of Allah.

And We had already given Moses the Torah after We had destroyed the nations that were before him, such as the people of Noah, Aad, Thamud, the people of Lot, and the people of Madyan. In it were insights for the Children of Israel, so that they might see what benefits them and what harms them, and in it was mercy for whoever among them acts upon it, that perhaps they might remember the favors of Allah upon them and thank Him for them and not be ungrateful to Him."
m-0765	And you, O Messenger, were not on the western side of the mountain from Moses when We charged him with Our command and prohibition, nor were you among the witnesses to that, so that it might be said that it reached you by this route. But We created nations after Moses, and they remained for a long time, so they forgot the covenant of Allah and abandoned His command. And you were not residing among the people of Madyan, reading to them Our book, so that you might know their story and tell it. But that news that you brought about Moses is a revelation and a witness to your message. And you, O Messenger, were not on the side of Mount Tur when We called to Moses, nor did you witness any of that, so that you might learn it. But We sent you as a mercy from your Lord, that you might warn a people to whom no warner had come before you, so that they might remember the good that you brought and do it, and the evil that you prohibited and avoid it.
m-0766	"And had it not been that a punishment should be sent down upon these disbelievers because of their disbelief in their Lord, they would say, ""Our Lord, why did You not send us a messenger before, so we could follow Your signs revealed in Your Book and be among the believers in You?"" But when Muhammad came to these people as a warner to them, they said, ""Why was not this one who was sent to us given the like of what was given to Moses of physical miracles and a Book revealed all at once?"" Say, ""O Messenger, did the Jews not disbelieve in what was given to Moses before?"" They say, ""In the Torah and the Qur'an, they are two magics that cooperate in their magic."" And they say, ""We are disbelievers in both of them."" Say, ""O Messenger, bring a book from God that is more upright than the Torah and the Qur'an, and I will follow it, if you are truthful in your claim."" But if they do not respond to you by bringing the book, and they have no argument left, then know that they only follow their desires, and no one is more astray than he who follows his desires without guidance from God. Indeed, God does not guide to the truth the wrongdoing people who disobeyed the command of God and transgressed His limits."
m-0767	"And We have explained and clarified the Qur’an as a mercy to your people, O Messenger, that they may remember and be admonished by it.

Those to whom We gave the Scripture before the Qur’an, and they are the Jews and Christians who did not change, believe in the Qur’an and in Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him.

And when this Qur’an is recited to those to whom We gave the Scripture, they say, “We believe in it and act according to what is in it. Indeed, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, we were, before its revelation, Muslims, monotheists.” So the religion of Allah is one, and it is Islam.

Those whose descriptions were mentioned above will be given the reward for their deeds twice for their belief in their Book and their belief in the Qur’an because of their patience. Among their descriptions is that they repel evil with good, and from what We have provided them, they spend in the way of goodness and righteousness. And when these people hear falsehood from the speech, they do not listen to it and say to us, “Our deeds, we do not deviate from them, and for you are your deeds and their burden is upon you.” So we do not occupy ourselves with responding to you, and you do not hear from us anything but good, and we do not address them according to your ignorance, because we do not want the path of the ignorant nor do we like it. This is one of the best things that the callers to Allah say.

He guides whomever He wills to guide to faith and grants him success to it, and He knows best who is fit for guidance, so He guides him."
m-0768	The infidels of Mecca said, “If we follow the truth that you have brought us and disavow the saints and the gods, we will be snatched from our land by killing and capturing and plundering wealth.” Did We not make them established in a secure land in which We have forbidden people to shed blood and which brings to it the fruits of all things as provision from Us? But most of these polytheists do not know the value of these blessings upon them, so that they may thank and obey the One Who bestowed them upon them. And many of the people of the towns We destroyed when their livelihood distracted them from believing in the messengers, so they disbelieved and transgressed. So those were their dwellings, and only a little of them were inhabited after them. And We are the inheritors of the servants. We cause them to grow, then they return to Us, and We reward them for their deeds. And your Lord, O Messenger, would not destroy the towns around Mecca in your time until He sent to its mother, which is Mecca, a messenger reciting to them Our verses. And We would not destroy the towns except while their people were wronging themselves by their disbelief in Allah and disobeying Him. Thus, they deserve punishment and chastisement.
m-0769	"And whatever you have been given, O people, of wealth and children, it is only a provision that you enjoy in this worldly life and an adornment with which to adorn oneself. And what is with Allah for those who obey Him and are loyal to Him is better and more lasting because it is everlasting and never ends. So do you not have minds, O people, with which to reflect and know good from evil? Is he to whom We have promised Paradise, who is to meet what He has promised and will go to it, like he to whom We have given enjoyment in the worldly life, and he enjoys it and prefers immediate pleasure over its deferred one? Then on the Day of Resurrection he will be among those brought forth for the reckoning and recompense. The two groups will not be equal, so let the wise choose for himself what is most worthy of choice, which is obedience to Allah and seeking His pleasure. And on the Day when Allah, the Almighty, will call out to those who associated with Him the saints and idols in this world, and He will say to them, “Where are My partners whom you claimed were My partners?” Those upon whom the punishment was justified, and they were the callers to disbelief, will say, “Our Lord, these are the ones whom We have led astray. We have led them astray as We led astray. We disavow to You their allegiance and support. They did not worship Us, but they worshipped The devils
And it will be said to the polytheists on the Day of Resurrection, ""Call upon your partners whom you used to worship besides God."" So they called upon them, but they did not respond to them, and they witnessed the punishment. If they had been guided to the truth in this world, they would not have been punished.

And on the Day when God calls upon these polytheists, He will say, ""How did you answer the messengers in what We sent them to you?""

So the arguments were hidden from them, so they did not know what to use as evidence, so they do not ask each other about what to use as evidence, a question of benefit.
As for the one who repents from the polytheists, and is sincere in worshipping God and doing what God and His Messenger have commanded him, he is among the successful in both abodes."
m-0770	And your Lord creates whatever He wills to create and chooses for His guardianship whomever He wills from among His creation. No one has any part in the command and choice. That is only for Allah, the Most High, and He is far above their association with Him. And your Lord knows what the hearts of His creation conceal and what they reveal. And He is Allah, there is no true deity other than Him. To Him belongs beautiful praise and thanks in this world and the Hereafter. And to Him you will be returned after your death for reckoning and recompense. Say, O Messenger, tell me, O people, if Allah made the night perpetually upon you until the Day of Resurrection, who is a god other than Allah who can bring you light by which you may be illuminated? Will you not hear with understanding and acceptance? Say to them, tell me, if Allah made the day perpetually upon you until the Day of Resurrection, who is a god other than Allah who can bring you a night in which you may rest and be calm? Will you not see with your eyes the difference between the night and the day? And of His mercy to you, O people, is that He made for you the night and the day and made them different, so He made this night darkness so that you may rest in it and your bodies may rest, and He made for you the day light so that you may seek your livelihood and thank Him for His favor upon you with that. And on the Day Allah will call out to these The polytheists will say to them, “Where are My partners whom you claimed in this world were My partners?” And We will extract from every nation of the disbelieving nations a witness, their prophet, who will testify to what happened in this world of their polytheism and their denial of their messengers. Then We will say to those nations who denied their messengers and what they brought from God, “Produce your proof for what you associated with God.” Then they will know that the conclusive proof is God’s against them and that the truth is God’s, and what they used to invent against their Lord will be removed from them. But that did not benefit them, rather it harmed them and led them to the fire of Hell.
m-0771	"Qarun was from the people of Moses, peace be upon him, and he exceeded his limits in his arrogance and tyranny over them. We gave Qarun from the treasures of wealth a great deal, so much so that its keys would be too heavy for many strong people to carry. When his people said to him, “Do not be arrogant with what you have of wealth. Indeed, Allah does not love those who are arrogant among His creation who do not thank Allah for what He has given them. Seek, from what Allah has given you of wealth, the reward of the Hereafter by working in it in obedience to Allah in this world. Do not neglect your share of this world by enjoying it in lawful ways without extravagance. Be good to people by giving charity as Allah has been good to you with this great wealth. Do not seek what Allah has forbidden you by transgressing against your people. Indeed, Allah does not love corrupters.” Qarun said to his people who admonished him, “I have only been given these treasures because of what I have of knowledge and power.” Did Qarun not know that Allah had destroyed before him nations who were stronger than him in power and more accumulating wealth? The criminals will not be asked about their sins, as Allah knows about them. They will only be asked a question of rebuke and confirmation, and Allah will punish them for what they have done. And he taught them from them
So Korah came out to his people in his finery, intending thereby to show his greatness and the abundance of his wealth. And when those who desired the adornments of the worldly life saw him, they said, “If only we had like that which Korah has been given of wealth, adornment, and status. Indeed, Korah has a great share of the world.” And those who were given knowledge of God and His law and knew the truth of matters said to those who said, “If only we had like that which Korah has been given.” Woe to you! Fear God and obey Him. The reward of God for those who believe in Him and His messengers and do righteous deeds is better than what Korah has been given. No one accepts this advice and is guided to it and acts upon it except the one who struggles with himself and is patient in obeying his Lord and avoids His disobedience."
m-0772	So We caused the earth to swallow up Qarun and his home. And he had no soldiers to help him other than Allah, nor could he be protected from Allah when He brought down His punishment upon him. And those who had wished for his situation the day before began to say, in pain and reflection and fearing the punishment to befall them, “Indeed, Allah expands the provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts whom He wills of them. Had Allah not been gracious to us and not punished us for what we said, He would have caused the earth to swallow us up as He did with Qarun. Do you not know that the disbelievers will not succeed, neither in this world nor in the Hereafter? That is the home of the Hereafter. We assign its delights to those who do not desire arrogance over the truth on the earth or corruption therein. And the good end is Paradise for those who fear Allah’s punishment, do good deeds, and avoid forbidden things. Whoever comes on the Day of Resurrection with sincere monotheism for Allah and righteous deeds in accordance with what Allah has prescribed, he will have a great reward better than that, and that good is Paradise and eternal bliss. And whoever comes with evil deeds, then those who do evil deeds will not be recompensed for their deeds except for what they used to do.”
m-0773	He who sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an and imposed on you its conveyance and adherence to it, will return you to the place from which you came, which is Mecca. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, “My Lord knows best who has brought guidance and who is clearly astray from the truth.” You, O Messenger, did not expect the Qur’an to be sent down to you, but Allah, the Most High, had mercy on you and sent it down to you. So be grateful to Allah for His blessings and do not be a helper to the people of polytheism and misguidance. Do not let these polytheists distract you from conveying the verses of your Lord and His proofs after He has sent them down to you. Convey the message of your Lord and do not be among the polytheists in anything. Do not worship another god with Allah, for there is no true god except Allah. Everything is perishable and fleeting except His Face. To Him belongs the judgement, and to Him you will be returned after your death for reckoning and recompense. In this verse, the attribute of the face is proven for Allah, the Most High, as befits His perfection and the greatness of His majesty.
m-0774	"Did not we already talk about the separate letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah?

I think that when people say, “We believe,” Allah will leave them without trial or testing.

And We have certainly tried those before them of the nations and tested them from those to whom We sent Our messengers. So Allah will surely make known with clear knowledge to mankind the truth of the truthful in their faith and the falsehood of the liars, that He may distinguish each group from the other.

Rather, I think that those who commit sins, such as polytheism and other things, will outstrip Us and will escape Us by themselves, so that we will not be able to control them. Evil is the judgment they make.

Whoever hopes to meet Allah and desires His reward, then the term Allah has set for resurrecting His creation for recompense and punishment will surely come soon. And He is the Hearer of words, the Knower of actions.

And whoever strives in the way of raising the word of Allah and strives against his soul by making it obey, then he only strives for his soul because he does that seeking reward for his striving. Indeed, Allah is independent of the deeds of all His creation. To Him belongs the kingdom and creation and the command.

And those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and do righteous deeds - We will surely erase from them their sins and reward them for their righteous deeds with the best of what they used to do."
m-0775	And We have enjoined upon man concerning his parents, that he should be dutiful to them and be good to them in word and deed. But if they endeavor to make you, O man, associate others with Me in worship, then do not obey their command. And seeking to associate others with God is included in all sins, so there is no obedience to any creature, whoever he may be, in disobeying God Almighty, as was confirmed from the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace: To Me is your destination on the Day of Resurrection, and I will inform you of what you used to do in this world of good and bad deeds, and I will reward you for them. And those who believed in God and His Messenger and did righteous deeds - We will surely admit them into Paradise among the righteous servants of God.
m-0776	"And among the people is he who says, ""We believe in Allah,"" but when the polytheists harm him, he is impatient at their punishment and their harm as he is impatient at the punishment of Allah and cannot endure the harm from Him, so he turns back from his faith. And if victory comes from your Lord, O Messenger, to the people of faith in Him, these apostates will surely say, ""Indeed, we were with you, O believers, and we gave you victory over your enemies."" Is not Allah better than anyone else of what is in the hearts of all His creation? And Allah will surely make known with clear knowledge those of creation who believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, and He will surely make known the hypocrites so that He may distinguish each group from the other. And those of Quraysh who denied the Oneness of Allah and did not believe in the threat and promise of Allah said to those of them who believed in Allah and acted according to His law, ""Leave the religion of Muhammad and follow our religion, for we will bear the burden of your sins."" But they will not bear any of their sins. Indeed, they are liars in what they said. And these polytheists will surely bear the burdens of themselves and the burdens of those they led astray and obstructed from the path of Allah, along with their own burdens, without any decrease. They will bear no sins from their followers, and they will be asked on the Day of Resurrection about the lies they used to fabricate."
m-0777	And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, calling them to monotheism and forbidding them from polytheism, but they did not respond to him, so Allah destroyed them with the Flood while they were wronging themselves in their disbelief and their transgression. So We saved Noah and those who followed him from among those who were with him in the ship, and We made that an example and a lesson for the worlds.
m-0778	And remember, O Messenger Abraham, peace be upon him, when he called his people to sincerely worship God alone and fear His wrath by performing His obligations and avoiding His disobedience. That is better for you, if you only knew what is better for you than what is worse for you. What you worship, O people, besides God are idols, and you invent a lie by calling them gods. Indeed, your idols that you worship besides God cannot provide you with anything. So seek provision from God, not from your idols, and sincerely worship Him and thank Him for His provision. You will be returned to God after your death, and He will reward you for what you have done. And if you, O people, deny our Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, in what he called you to of worshipping God alone, then groups before you denied their messengers in what they called them to of the truth, so the wrath of God befell them. And the Messenger Muhammad has no duty except to convey to you from God His message with clear communication, and he did.
m-0779	Do these people not know how Allah creates creation from nothing and then restores it after its annihilation, just as He began it the first time, a new creation? That is not difficult for Him. Indeed, that is easy for Allah, just as it was easy for Him to create it. Say, O Messenger, to those who deny resurrection after death: Travel through the earth and see how Allah created creation. It was not difficult for Him to create it in the beginning, so it is not difficult for Him to recreate it in the Hereafter. Indeed, Allah is Able to do all things. Nothing He wills is beyond His power. He punishes whomever He wills of His creation for what he has done in the past of his crime during the days of his life, and He has mercy on whomever He wills of them who repents, believes, and does righteousness. And to Him you will be returned, and He will recompense you for what you have done. And you, O people, will not be able to frustrate Allah on earth or in heaven if you disobey Him. And you have not besides Allah any guardian to oversee your affairs, nor any helper to aid you from Allah if He intends evil for you. And those who have rejected the proofs of Allah and denied His evidence and the meeting with Him on the Day of Resurrection - those have no hope of My mercy when they witness what has been prepared for them of punishment. And those will have a painful, painful punishment.
m-0780	"The only answer of the people of Abraham to him was that some of them said to each other, ""Kill him or burn him with fire."" So they threw him into it. But God saved him from it and made it cool and safe for him. Indeed, in Our saving of Abraham from the Fire are proofs and arguments for a people who believe in God and act according to His law. And Abraham said to his people, ""O my people, you only worshipped false gods besides God, which you took as a means of affection among yourselves in worldly life. You loved one another in worshipping them and loved one another in serving them. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will disown one another and curse one another, and your final destination will all be the Fire. And you will have no helper to prevent you from entering it."" So Lot believed Abraham and followed his religion. And Abraham said, ""Indeed, I am leaving the home of my people for the blessed land, which is Ash-Sham. Indeed, God is the Exalted in Might, Who cannot be overcome by the Wise in His plan."" And We gave him Isaac as a son, and after him Jacob as a son, and We placed among his descendants the prophets and the scriptures. And We gave him the reward of his trial among Us in this world - a good mention and a righteous son. And indeed, in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous."
m-0781	"And remember, O Messenger, Lot, when he said to his people, “Indeed, you commit an ugly deed, such as no one before you did before you in the world. Do you approach men from behind and block the travelers’ paths with your evil deeds? And do in your gatherings reprehensible deeds, such as mocking people, insulting passersby, and harming them with inappropriate words and deeds?” This is a notification that it is not permissible for people to gather together for the evil that Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. So the only response of the people of Lot to him was to say, “We have brought the punishment of Allah, if you are of the truthful in what you say and the fulfillers of what you promise.” And remember, O Messenger, Lot, when he said to his people, “Indeed, you commit an ugly deed, such as no one before you did before you in the world. Do you approach men from behind and block the travelers’ paths with your evil deeds? And do in your gatherings reprehensible deeds, such as mocking people, insulting passersby, and harming them with inappropriate words and deeds?” This is a notification that it is not permissible for people to gather together for the evil that Allah and His Messenger have forbidden. So it was not The response of the people of Lot to him was that they said, ""We have brought the punishment of Allah, if you are of the truthful in what you say and the fulfillers of what you promise."" He said, ""My Lord, help me against the corrupt people by sending down the punishment upon them, since they innovated the immorality and persisted in it."" So Allah answered his prayer. When the angels came to Abraham with the good news from Allah about Isaac and after Isaac his son Jacob, the angels said to Abraham, ""Indeed, we are going to destroy the people of the city of the people of Lot, which is Sodom. Indeed, its people were wronging themselves by their disobedience to Allah."" Abraham said to the angels, ""Indeed, Lot is in it, and he is not among the wrongdoers."" The angels said to him, ""We know best who is in it. We will surely save him and his family from the destruction that will befall the people of his city, except for his wife, who was among those who remain destroyed."" When the angels came to Lot, he was upset because he thought they were human guests, and he was saddened by their presence, knowing the evil of his people's actions. They said to him, ""Do not fear for us; your people will not reach us, and do not grieve over what we have told you about who we are to destroy. Indeed, we will save you."" From the torment that has descended upon your people, and save your family with you, except for your wife, for she is to perish among those who perish from her people.

Indeed, We are sending down upon the people of this city a punishment from the sky because of their disobedience to God and their commission of immorality.

And We have certainly left clear traces of the dwellings of the people of Lot for a people who understand the lessons and benefit from them."
m-0782	"And We sent to Madyan their brother Shu`ayb, and he said to them, ""O my people, worship God alone and devote worship to Him alone. You have no deity other than Him. And hope through your worship for the reward of the Last Day. And do not spread corruption and disobedience on the earth, nor persist in it. But repent to God from it and return [to Him]."" But the people of Madyan denied Shu`ayb in what he had brought them from God of the message, so a severe earthquake seized them, and they became in their home fallen down, perishing."
m-0783	And We destroyed Aad and Thamud, and it was clear to you from their dwellings that they were ruined and empty of them, and that Our punishment had befallen them all. And Satan made their evil deeds seem good to them, so he turned them away from the path of Allah and from the path of faith in Him and His messengers. And they were insightful in their disbelief and misguidance, admiring Him, thinking that they were on the right path and correctness, while they were drowning in misguidance. And We destroyed Qarun, Pharaoh, and Haman, and Moses had already brought them all clear proofs, but they were arrogant and haughty in the land. And they were not going to escape Us; rather, We had power over them. So We seized each of those mentioned with Our punishment because of his sin. Among them were those upon whom We sent stones of layered clay, and they were the people of Lot. And among them were those whom the blast seized, and they were the people of Salih and the people of Shu`ayb. And among them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow, like Qarun. And among them were those whom We drowned, and they were the people of Noah, Pharaoh, and his people. And Allah would not have destroyed these for the sins of others, so He would have wronged them by destroying them without justification, but they were wronging themselves. By enjoying the blessings of their Lord and worshipping others besides Him
m-0784	The parable of those who have taken idols as protectors other than Allah, hoping for their support, is like the parable of the spider who made a house for herself to protect herself, but it did not avail her at all when she needed it. So likewise these polytheists, their protectors whom they have taken other than Allah did not avail them at all. And indeed, the weakest of houses is the spider’s house. If they had known that, they would not have taken them as protectors, for they neither benefit them nor harm them. Indeed, Allah knows what they associate with Him of rivals, and that they are nothing in reality, but rather are merely names that they have named, neither benefiting nor harming. And He is the Exalted in Might in His vengeance upon those who disbelieve in Him, the Wise in His management and creation. And these examples We present to the people so that they may benefit from them and learn from them, and none understands them except those who have knowledge of Allah, His verses, and His law.
m-0785	Allah created the heavens and the earth with justice and equity. Indeed, in His creation is a great indication of His power and His uniqueness in divinity. He singled out the believers because they are the ones who benefit from that. Recite what has been revealed to you of this Qur’an and act upon it. Perform the prayer within its limits. Maintaining the prayer prevents its doer from falling into sins and wrongdoings. This is because the one who establishes it and completes its pillars and conditions has his heart enlightened, his faith increased, his desire for good strengthened, and his desire for evil decreased or disappeared. And remembering Allah in prayer and other than it is greater, bigger, and better than everything. And Allah knows what you do of good and evil, so He will reward you for that with the most complete and most perfect reward.
m-0786	And do not argue, O believers, with the Jews and Christians except with good manners and beautiful speech and calling to the truth by the easiest way that leads to that, except for those who have deviated from the path of truth and are stubborn and obstinate and have declared war on you. So fight them with the sword until they believe or pay the jizyah willingly and are humbled. And say, “We believe in the Qur’an that was sent down to us and we believe in the Torah and the Gospel that were sent down to you. And our God and your God is One. He has no partner in His divinity or in His Lordship or in His names and attributes. And we are submissive to Him, humbled in obedience to what He has commanded us and forbidden us from.” And just as We sent down the Books, O Messenger, to those before you of the Messengers, We have sent down to you this Book confirming the previous Books. So those to whom We gave the Book from among the Children of Israel and they recognized it as it should be known, believe in the Qur’an. And among these Arabs from Quraysh and others are those who believe in it. And no one denies the Qur’an or doubts its clear proofs and evidence except the disbelievers whose habit is denial and stubbornness.
m-0787	"Among your clear miracles, O Messenger, is that you did not read a book or write letters with your right hand before the Qur’an was revealed to you, and they know that. If you had been a reader or a writer before revelation came to you, the falsifiers would have doubted that and said, “You learned it from previous books or copied it from them.”

Rather, the Qur’an is clear and evident verses indicating the truth, preserved by scholars. None denies Our verses and rejects them except the stubborn wrongdoers who know the truth and deviate from it.

The polytheists say, “Why were not signs and arguments sent down to Muhammad from his Lord that we could see, like the she-camel of Salih and the staff of Moses?” Say to them, “Indeed, the matter of these verses is with Allah. If He wills, He will send them down, and if He wills, He will withhold them.” I am only a warner to you, warning you of the severity of His punishment and His punishment, making clear the path of truth from falsehood.

Is it not enough for these polytheists in their knowledge of your truthfulness, O Messenger, that We have sent down to you the Qur’an, which is recited to them? Indeed, in this Qur’an is mercy for the believers in this world and the Hereafter, and a reminder for them to remember, with what is in it of lessons and admonitions.

Say, “Sufficient is Allah between me and you as a witness to my truthfulness, that I am His Messenger.” And because of your denial of me and your rejection of the truth that I have brought from God, He knows what is in the heavens and the earth, and nothing in them is hidden from Him. And those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in God despite these clear proofs - it is they who are the losers in this world and the Hereafter."
m-0788	"And these polytheists among your people are hastening you, O Messenger, with the punishment in mockery. And had it not been that Allah has set a time for their punishment in this world that cannot be advanced or delayed, the punishment would have come to them when they asked for it. And it will come to them suddenly while they do not perceive it or sense it.

They are hastening you with the punishment in this world, and it will inevitably come to them, either in this world or in the Hereafter. And indeed, the punishment of Hell in the Hereafter will surround them, and they will have no escape from it.

On the Day of Resurrection, the punishment of Hell will cover the disbelievers from above their heads and from beneath their feet. The Fire will cover them from all sides. And Allah will say to them at that time, ""Taste the recompense for what you used to do in this world, of associating partners with Allah and committing crimes and sins."""
m-0789	O My servants who have believed, if you are in distress from showing faith and worshipping Allah alone, then emigrate to Allah's spacious land and devote worship to Me alone. Every living soul will taste death. Then to Us you will be returned for reckoning and recompense. And those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and done what they were commanded of righteous deeds - We will surely admit them into high chambers in Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. Yes, the reward of those who work in obedience to Allah is these chambers in the Gardens of Bliss. Indeed, those gardens mentioned are for the believers who were patient in worshipping Allah and held fast to their religion and relied on Allah for their provisions and for fighting their enemies. How many a creature does not store its food for tomorrow as the son of Adam does? Allah, the Most High, provides for it as He provides for you. He is the Hearer of your words, the Knower of your actions and the thoughts of your hearts.
m-0790	"And if you ask, O Messenger, the polytheists, who created the heavens and the earth in this wondrous system and subjected the sun and the moon, they will surely say, “Allah alone created them.” So how can they be turned away from believing in Allah, the Creator and Manager of all things, and worship other than Him? So be amazed at their falsehood and lies. Allah, the Exalted, expands provision for whomever He wills of His creation and restricts it for others, because of His knowledge of what is good for His servants. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of all your conditions and affairs. Nothing is hidden from Him. And if you ask, O Messenger, the polytheists, who sent down water from the clouds and thereby caused the earth to grow after its dryness, they will surely say, acknowledging, “Allah alone is the One Who sent that down.” Say, “Praise be to Allah, Who has made Your proof manifest against them.” Rather, most of them do not understand what benefits them or what harms them. Had they understood, they would not have associated with Allah other than Him. And this worldly life is nothing but amusement and play, with which hearts play and bodies play because of the adornments and desires in it, then it quickly disappears. Indeed, the Hereafter is the true, everlasting life in which there is no death, if only people knew. That is because they preferred the abode of mortality over the abode of eternity.

So when the disbelievers board ships at sea and fear drowning, they worship Allah alone and are sincere in supplication to Him during their distress, but when He delivers them to land and the distress is removed from them, they return to their polytheism. They contradict themselves by this. They worship Allah alone at the time of distress and associate others with Him at the time of ease. Their polytheism, after Our favor upon them by saving them from the sea, is to result in disbelief in what We have bestowed upon them in their persons and their wealth, and to complete their enjoyment in this world. They will soon come to know the corruption of their deeds and the painful torment that Allah has prepared for them on the Day of Resurrection. In that is a threat and warning to them.

Did not the disbelievers of Mecca see that Allah made Mecca a safe sanctuary for them, where its people are safe for their lives and their wealth, while the people around them outside the sanctuary are being snatched away, not safe? So do they believe in polytheism and disbelieve in the favor of Allah with which He has singled them out, so they do not worship Him alone without anyone else? No one is more unjust than he who lies about Allah and attributes what he is upon of misguidance and falsehood to Allah, or denies the truth with which Allah sent His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Indeed, in the Fire is a dwelling for he who disbelieves in Allah, denies His Oneness, and denies His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And the believers who struggle against the enemies of Allah, the self, and Satan, and are patient in the face of trials and harm for the sake of Allah, Allah will guide them to the paths of goodness and make them steadfast on the straight path. And whoever has this characteristic is a doer of good to himself and to others. Indeed, Allah, the Most High, the Most Great, has blessed whoever does good among His creation with victory, support, protection, and guidance."
m-0791	Didn't we already talk about the disconnected letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah? The Persians defeated the Romans in the lowest land of Ash-Sham to Persia. The Romans will defeat the Persians in a period of time not exceeding ten years and not less than three. The whole matter before and after the victory of the Romans is in God Almighty. And on the day the Romans defeat the Persians, the believers will rejoice in God's victory for the Romans over the Persians.

m-0792	"Did not these deniers of Allah's messengers and meeting Him reflect on Allah's creation of them and that He created them and they were nothing? Allah created the heavens and the earth and everything between them only to establish justice, reward and punishment, and to indicate His Oneness and His power and a specified term to which they will end, which is the Day of Resurrection? And indeed, many people are ungrateful and deny the meeting with their Lord, out of ignorance on their part that their return will be to Allah after their annihilation and their heedlessness of the Hereafter. Did not these deniers of Allah, who are heedless of the Hereafter, travel on the earth, contemplating and considering, so that they could see how the reward of the nations who denied Allah's messengers was, such as 'Aad and Thamud, who were stronger than them in bodies and more able to enjoy life, as they tilled the land and planted it and built palaces and inhabited them, so they populated their worldly life more than the people of Mecca populated their worldly life, but their construction and the length of their life did not benefit them, and their messengers came to them with clear proofs and shining evidence, but they denied them, so Allah destroyed them. Allah did not wrong them with that destruction, but they wronged themselves with polytheism and disobedience.

m-0793	"O you who believe, glorify Allah and declare Him free from any partner, companion or son, and describe Him with the attributes of perfection with your tongues and realize that with all your limbs when you go to bed, when you wake up, at dusk and at noon, and to Him be praise and thanks in the heavens and the earth, during the night and the day. O you who believe, glorify Allah and declare Him free from any partner, companion or son, and describe Him with the attributes of perfection with your tongues and realize that with all your limbs when you go to bed, when you wake up, at dusk and at noon, and to Him be praise and thanks in the heavens and the earth, during the night and the day. Allah brings the living out of the dead, just as a human being comes out of a sperm-drop and a bird comes out of an egg, and He brings the dead out of the living, just as a sperm-drop comes out of a human being and an egg comes out of a bird, and He revives the earth with plants after it has dried up and become dry. And like this revival, you, O people, will emerge from your graves alive for the reckoning and reward. And among the signs of Allah that indicate His greatness and the perfection of His power is that He created your father Adam from dust, then you are human beings who reproduce and spread out on the earth. You seek from the bounty of Allah
And among His signs that indicate His greatness and the perfection of His power is that He created for you, O men, from your kind, mates that your souls may find peace and tranquility in them, and He has put between the woman and her husband love and compassion. Indeed in that creation of Allah are signs that indicate Allah’s power and His Oneness for a people who reflect and ponder.
And among the signs of the divine power is the creation of the heavens and their elevation without pillars, and the creation of the earth with its vastness and extension, and the difference in your languages ​​and the diversity of your colors. Indeed in this is a lesson for everyone with knowledge and insight.
And among the signs of this power is that Allah made sleep a rest for you at night or during the day, since in sleep you obtain rest and go away fatigue, and He made for you the day in which you spread out to seek provision. Indeed in that are signs of the perfection of Allah’s power and the effectiveness of His will for a people who listen to the sermons with contemplation, reflection and consideration.
And among the signs of His power, glory be to Him, is that He shows you lightning so that you fear the thunderbolts and hope for rain, and He sends down rain from the clouds and revives the earth after its drought and dryness. Indeed in this is a sign of the perfection of Allah’s power and the greatness of His wisdom. And His kindness to all who have a mind to guide them.

And among His signs that indicate His power is the establishment of the heavens and the earth and their stability and firmness by His command, so they did not shake nor did the heavens fall to the earth. Then, when Allah calls you to the resurrection on the Day of Resurrection, at once you will emerge from the graves in haste.

And to Allah alone belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, from the angels, mankind, jinn, animals, plants, and inanimate objects. All of these are obedient to His command and subject to His perfection.

And Allah alone is He who begins creation from nothingness and then brings it back to life after death. And bringing back to life after death is easier for Allah than starting their creation, and both are easy for Him. And to Him, glory be to Him, is the highest description in everything with which He is described. There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. He is the Mighty, who cannot be overcome. The Wise in His words, actions, and management of the affairs of His creation."
m-0794	Allah has set forth an example for you, O polytheists, from among yourselves. Do you have any of your male and female slaves who share your provision and see that you and them are equal in it? Do you fear them as you fear free partners in dividing your wealth? You will never be satisfied with that. How can you be satisfied with that in the presence of Allah, that you make a partner for Him from among His creation? And with such a statement, we show the proofs and arguments for those with sound minds who benefit from it. Rather, the polytheists followed their desires by imitating their fathers without knowledge, so they shared with them in ignorance and misguidance. No one is able to guide those whom Allah has led astray because of their persistence in disbelief and stubbornness. And these people have no supporters who can save them from the punishment of Allah. So, O Messenger, establish your face, you and those who follow you, and continue upon the religion that Allah has prescribed for you, which is Islam, upon which Allah has created people. So your remaining upon it and adhering to it is adhering to the nature of Allah, which is belief in Allah alone. There is no change in the creation of Allah and His religion. It is the straight path that leads to the pleasure of Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and His Paradise. But most people do not know that what I have commanded you to do. O Messenger, this is the true religion and no other. Return to God with repentance and sincerity in your work for Him, and fear Him by doing what He commands and avoiding what He prohibits, and establish prayer completely with its pillars, obligations, and conditions, and do not be among those who associate others with God in worship. Do not be among the polytheists and people of whims and innovations who have changed their religion and altered it, taking some of it and leaving some of it according to their whims, and have become sects and parties that follow their leaders, parties, and opinions, helping each other in falsehood, each party rejoicing and happy with what they have, judging for themselves that they are on the right and others on falsehood.
m-0795	"And when hardship and affliction befall the people, they call upon their Lord sincerely to remove the affliction from them. But when He has mercy on them and removes their affliction, at once a party of them return to polytheism again and worship other than Him along with Allah.

So enjoy, O polytheists, the ease and abundance in this world. And you will soon know what torment and punishment you will receive.

Or have We sent down upon these polytheists a clear proof and a decisive Book that speaks of the truth of their polytheism and their disbelief in Allah and His signs?

And when We let the people taste a blessing from Us of health, well-being and ease, they rejoice in that with a joy of arrogance and evil, not a joy of gratitude. But if illness, poverty, fear and distress befall them because of their sins and transgressions, at once they despair of that being removed. This is the nature of most people in times of ease and hardship.

Do they not know that Allah expands provision for whom He wills as a test whether he will be grateful or ungrateful, and He restricts it for whom He wills as a test whether he will be patient or impatient? Indeed in that is expansion. And the restriction is for signs for a people who believe in God and know the wisdom and mercy of God."
m-0796	So, O believer, give your relative his due right of kinship, charity, and other righteous deeds, and give to the poor and needy who have lost their way, zakat and charity. This giving is better for those who desire the pleasure of Allah by their deeds, and those who do these deeds and other good deeds, they are the ones who will win the reward of Allah and will be saved from His punishment. And whatever you give in loans with the intention of usury and seeking an increase in that loan so that it will increase and grow in the wealth of people, it will not increase with Allah, but rather He will wipe it out and nullify it. And whatever you give in zakat and charity to those who are deserving, seeking the pleasure of Allah and seeking His reward, this is what Allah will accept and multiply for you many times over. Allah alone is the One Who created you, O people, then provided for you in this life, then He will cause you to die at the end of your appointed time, then He will raise you from the graves alive for the reckoning and recompense. Is there among your partners any who do any of that? Allah is far removed and sanctified from the association of these polytheists with Him. Corruption has appeared on land and sea, such as drought, lack of rain, and many diseases and epidemics, and this is due to the sins that people commit in order to be afflicted with them. By punishing some of the deeds they did in this world so that they repent to God Almighty and turn away from sins, so that their conditions improve and their affairs become straight.
m-0797	"Say, O Messenger, to those who deny what you have brought: Travel throughout the earth, reflecting and pondering, and see how was the end of the previous nations who denied, such as the people of Noah, Aad, and Thamud. You will find their end was the worst of ends and their final destination was the worst of destinations. Most of them were polytheists. So, O Messenger, direct your face toward the straight religion, which is Islam, carrying out its commands and avoiding its prohibitions, and hold fast to it before the Day of Resurrection comes. When that day comes, which no one can avert, the creation will be scattered in different groups to see their deeds. Whoever disbelieves, then upon him is the punishment of his disbelief, which is his eternity in the Fire. Whoever believes and does righteous deeds, then for themselves they prepare the dwellings of Paradise because of their adherence to the obedience of their Lord. 

That Allah may reward those who believed in Allah and His Messenger and did righteous deeds out of His bounty and kindness. Indeed, He does not love the disbelievers, due to His wrath and anger upon them."
m-0798	"And among the signs of Allah that indicate that He is the only true God, with no partner, and that His power is great, is sending the winds before the rain, bringing good tidings by stirring up the clouds, so that souls may be gladdened by that, and that He may let you taste of His mercy by sending down the rain by which the lands and people live, and that ships may sail in the sea by the command and will of Allah, and that you may seek of His bounty through trade and other things. Allah did that so that you may thank Him for His blessings and worship Him alone. And We had already sent before you, O Messenger, messengers to their people, bringing good tidings and warnings, calling them to monotheism and warning them against polytheism. They came to them with miracles and clear proofs, but most of them disbelieved in their Lord. So We took revenge on those among them who had committed evil deeds, so We destroyed them and gave victory to the believers, the followers of the messengers. And thus We will deal with those who deny you if they persist in denying you and do not believe. Allah, glory be to Him, is the One Who sends the winds, and they stir up clouds laden with water, and Allah spreads them in the sky as He wills and makes them into scattered pieces, so you see the rain coming out from between the clouds. Then when Allah drives it to His servants, at once they are They rejoice and rejoice that Allah has directed that to them

Although before the rain fell, they were in despair and hopelessness because of its withholding from them

So look, O observer, with a look of contemplation and reflection at the effects of rain on plants, crops and trees, how Allah revives the earth after its death, so He makes it grow and vegetate. Indeed, He who is able to revive this earth is the One who revives the dead, and He is over all things competent. Nothing is beyond His power

And if We send upon their crops and plants a destructive wind, and they see that their plants have been corrupted by that wind, and become yellow after their greenness, they will remain after seeing it disbelieving in Allah and denying His favors

For you, O Messenger, do not hear one whose heart is dead or whose ear is blocked from hearing the truth, so do not be alarmed or saddened by the lack of faith of these polytheists in you, for they are like the deaf and the dead, they do not hear or feel even if they were present, so how would it be if they were absent from you and turned away

And you, O Messenger, are not a guide for one whom Allah has blinded from the path of guidance. You do not hear a hearing of benefit except for those who believe in Our verses, so they are submissive Obedient to God's command"
m-0799	God Almighty is the One who created you from a weak, despised water, which is the sperm. Then, after the weakness of childhood, He made the strength of manhood. Then, after this strength, He made the weakness of old age and decrepitude. God creates whatever He wills of weakness and strength, and He is the All-Knowing of His creation, Able to do all things.
m-0800	"And on the Day of Resurrection, when Allah resurrects the creation from their graves, the polytheists will swear that they did not remain in this world except for a short period of time. They lied in their oath as they used to lie in this world and denied the truth that the messengers brought.

And those who were given knowledge and faith in Allah from the angels, the prophets and the believers will say, ""You have remained in what Allah has decreed of what preceded in His knowledge from the day you were created until you were resurrected. This is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know."" So you denied it in this world and denied it.

On the Day of Resurrection, the excuses they present will not benefit the wrongdoers, nor will they be asked to please Allah Almighty through repentance and obedience. Rather, they will be punished for their misdeeds and transgressions.

And We have already explained to the people in this Qur’an every example in order to establish the proof against them and prove the Oneness of Allah, the Most High. And if you, O Messenger, bring them any proof that proves your truthfulness, those who disbelieve in you will surely say, ""You, O Messenger, and your followers, are nothing but falsifiers in what you bring us of matters.""

And like that seal, Allah seals the hearts of those who do not know the truth of what You bring them, O Messenger, from God, these clear lessons and signs. So be patient, O Messenger, over the harm that befalls you from your people and their denial of you. Indeed, what God has promised you of victory, empowerment, and reward is true, without doubt. And do not let those who do not believe in the appointed time and do not believe in the resurrection and the reward provoke you away from your religion."
m-0801	"Did not we previously talk about the disconnected letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah?

These verses are verses of the Qur’an with the most profound wisdom.

These verses are guidance and mercy for those who do good deeds according to what Allah has revealed in the Qur’an and what His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has commanded them to do.

Those who perform the prayer completely at its appointed times and give the obligatory charity to those who are entitled to it, and they are certain of the resurrection and the reward in the Hereafter.

Those who are described by the previous attributes are clear from their Lord and light. And it is those who are the successful in this world and the Hereafter."
m-0802	And among the people is he who buys the amusement of speech, which is everything that distracts from obeying Allah and turns away from His pleasure, in order to mislead people from the path of guidance to the path of desire, and he takes the verses of Allah in mockery. For those is a punishment that will humiliate them and disgrace them. And when the verses of the Qur’an are recited to him, he turns away from obeying Allah and is arrogant, not taking it into consideration, as if he had not heard a thing, as if there was deafness in his ears. And whoever is in this state, give him tidings, O Messenger, of a painful, grievous punishment in the Fire on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and done righteous deeds which they were commanded - for them is eternal bliss in the Gardens. And their life in those Gardens is an eternal life that will not cease or disappear. Allah has promised them that with a true promise, and He, glory be to Him, does not fail in His promise. And He is the Exalted in Might in His command, the Wise in His management.
m-0803	God created the heavens and raised them without pillars as you see them, and He cast into the earth firm mountains so that it would not shake and move and spoil your life, and He spread on the earth various kinds of animals, and We sent down from the clouds rain, and We caused to grow thereby from the earth every beautiful, beneficial, and beautiful pair. All that you see is God’s creation, so show me, O polytheists, what your gods that you worship besides God have created. Rather, the polytheists are in clear error from the truth and righteousness.
m-0804	And We gave to a righteous servant of Ours, Luqman, wisdom, which is understanding of religion, soundness of mind, and correctness of speech. And We said to him, “Be grateful to Allah for His favors upon you. And whoever is grateful to his Lord, then the benefit of that will return to him. And whoever denies His favors, then indeed, Allah is free from need of his gratitude, and has no need of it. To Him is praise and thanks in every situation.” And remember, O Messenger, the advice of Luqman to his son when he said to him, admonishing him, “O my son, do not associate partners with Allah, lest you wrong yourself. Indeed, association is the greatest and most heinous of major sins.”
m-0805	And We have commanded man to be dutiful to his parents and to be kind to them. His mother bore him, weak and weak, and carried him and weaned him from breastfeeding within a period of two years. And We said to him, “Be grateful to God, then be grateful to your parents. To Me is the return, so I will reward each according to what he deserves.” And if your parents, O believing son, strive to make you associate others with Me in your worship of Me, of which you have no knowledge, or command you to commit a sin from the sins of God, do not obey them, because there is no obedience to a creature in disobedience to the Creator. And accompany them in this world in what is appropriate in that in which there is no sin. And follow, O believing son, the path of one who repents from his sin and returns to Me and believes in My Messenger Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. Then to Me is your return, and I will inform you of what you used to do in this world, and I will reward each worker for his work.
m-0806	O my son, know that if a bad or good deed is the size of a mustard seed, which is extremely small in the interior of a mountain, or in any place in the heavens or on the earth, then Allah will bring it on the Day of Resurrection and hold you accountable for it. Indeed, Allah is Kind to His servants and is All-Knowing of their deeds. O my son, perform the prayer completely with its pillars, conditions, and obligations. Enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong with kindness, gentleness, and wisdom according to your ability. Bear whatever harm befalls you in return for enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. Know that these commandments are among the things that Allah has commanded us to be keen on. Do not turn your face away from people when you speak to them or they speak to you, showing contempt for them and showing arrogance towards them. Do not walk on the earth among people arrogantly and haughtily. Indeed, Allah does not love anyone who is arrogant and boastful about himself, his appearance, and his speech. Be humble in your walk and lower your voice, do not raise it. Indeed, the ugliest and most hated of voices is the voice of donkeys, which are known for their dullness and loud voices.
m-0807	Have you not seen, O people, that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens of the sun, the moon, the clouds, and other things, and whatever is on the earth of animals, trees, water, and other things that are innumerable, and has encompassed you with His blessings, apparent in the bodies and limbs, and hidden in the minds and hearts, and what He has stored up for you of things that you do not know? And among the people is he who disputes the oneness of Allah and the sincerity of worship to Him without proof, explanation, or a clear book that explains the truth of his claim. And when it is said to these disputers about the oneness of Allah and the singling out of worship for Him alone, follow what Allah has revealed to His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, they say, “Rather, we follow what our fathers were upon of polytheism and the worship of idols.” Would they do that even if Satan were inviting them, by making their evil deeds and disbelief in Allah seem attractive to them, to the torment of the blazing Fire? Whoever sincerely worships Allah and intends his Lord, the Most High, and is good in his words and perfects his actions, has taken the most reliable path leading to the pleasure of Allah and His Paradise, and to Allah alone all matters return, so He rewards the doer of good for his good and the wrongdoer for his wrongdoing. And whoever disbelieves, do not grieve over him. O Messenger, do not grieve because you have fulfilled your duty of calling and conveying the message. To Us is their return and their destination on the Day of Resurrection. We will inform them of their evil deeds that they did in this world, then We will reward them for them. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of what their hearts conceal of disbelief in Allah and preference for obeying Satan. We will let them enjoy this fleeting world for a short time, then on the Day of Resurrection We will force them and drive them to a terrible punishment, which is the punishment of Hell. And if you ask, O Messenger, these polytheists who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely say, “Allah.” When they say that, then say to them, “Praise be to Allah, who has shown you the proof from yourselves.” Rather, most of these polytheists do not look or ponder who is to whom praise and thanks are due, so they have associated others with Him. To Allah belongs everything in the heavens and the earth, in ownership and in servants, in creation and in estimation. No one deserves worship except Him. Indeed, Allah is independent of His creation. To Him be praise and thanks in every situation.
m-0808	And if all the trees of the earth were to be sharpened as pens, and the sea were to be their ink, and were to be replenished with seven more seas, and the words of God were written with those pens and that ink, those pens would be broken, and that ink would be used up, but the perfect words of God, which no one can comprehend, would not be used up. Indeed, God is Mighty in His vengeance against those who associate others with Him, Wise in the management of His creation. And in the verse is proof of the attribute of speech for God Almighty in reality, as befits His majesty and perfection. Glory be to Him. He did not create you, O people, nor resurrect you on the Day of Resurrection in ease and simplicity except as He created a single soul and resurrected it. Indeed, God is Hearing of your words, Seeing of your deeds, and He will reward you for them.
m-0809	Have you not seen that Allah takes from the hours of the night and lengthens the day and shortens the night, and He takes from the hours of the day and lengthens the night and shortens the day? And He has subjected to you the sun and the moon, each running in its orbit for a known and specified term, and that Allah is aware of all the deeds of creation, whether good or evil, nothing of them is hidden from Him. All of this is from My great power, so that you may know and acknowledge that Allah is the Truth in His Essence, His attributes and His actions, and that what they call upon besides Him is falsehood, and that Allah is the Most High in His Essence, His power and His might above all His creation, the Great over all things, and everything other than Him is subject to Him, so He alone is worthy of being worshipped, without anyone else. Have you not seen, O observer, that ships sail in the sea by the command of Allah, as a blessing from Him to His creation, so that He may show you from His lessons and His proofs against you, by which you may take heed. Indeed, in the sailing of ships in the sea are signs for everyone who is patient about the prohibitions of Allah and grateful for His blessings. And when the polytheists board ships and the waves around them rise up like clouds and mountains, fear and panic from drowning overtake them, so they turn to Allah and sincerely call upon Him in their supplication. But when He delivers them to the land, some of them are intermediate and do not stand. I thank God in a perfect way, and among them is a disbeliever in God’s blessings and denies them. And none disbelieves in Our signs and proofs that indicate the perfection of Our power and Our Oneness except every traitor who breaks the covenant and denies God’s blessings upon him.
m-0810	O people, fear your Lord and obey Him by complying with His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. Beware of the Day of Resurrection when no father will avail his son, nor will a son avail his father at all. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth, there is no doubt about it. So do not be deceived by the life of this world and its adornments, lest you forget the Hereafter. And do not be deceived by Allah by a deceiver from among the devils of jinn and mankind. Indeed, Allah alone, and no one else, knows when the Hour will come. It is He who sends down rain from the clouds. No one else has power over that. He knows what is in the wombs of females, and He knows what every soul will earn tomorrow. No soul knows in what land it will die. Rather, Allah is the One who is the Special One with knowledge of all of that. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing, All-Aware, encompassing the apparent and the hidden. Nothing of it is hidden from Him.
m-0811	"Didn’t we already talk about the disconnected letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah?

This Qur’an that Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, brought, there is no doubt that it was sent down from God, the Lord of all creation.

Indeed, do the polytheists say that Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, fabricated the Qur’an? They lie. Rather, it is the established truth sent down to you, O Messenger, from your Lord, that you may warn thereby people to whom no warner came before you, that they may be guided and recognize the truth, believe in it, give it priority, and believe in you."
m-0812	Allah is He who created the heavens and the earth and what is between them in six days for a wisdom that He knows, and He is able to create them with a word, “Be,” and they are. Then He rose up, glory be to Him, that is, He ascended and rose above His throne in a manner befitting His majesty, not likening it to the creation of His creatures. You, O people, have no guardian to oversee your affairs or intercessor to intercede for you with Allah so that you may be saved from His punishment. Will you not learn a lesson and reflect, O people? So single out Allah with divinity and devote worship to Him. Allah, the Most High, manages the affairs of the creatures from the heavens to the earth, then that matter and management ascends to Allah in a day the measure of which is a thousand years of the days of this world that you count. That is the Creator who manages the affairs of the worlds. He knows everything that is hidden from sight, of what the hearts conceal and the souls conceal, and He knows what the eyes see. He is the Strong, the Manifest, who cannot be overcome. He is the Merciful to His believing servants. Allah is He who perfected the creation of everything and began the creation of man, who is Adam, peace be upon him, from clay. Then He made the offspring of Adam reproduce from a weak, delicate, insignificant drop. Then He completed the creation of man and perfected him and made him good. He created him and breathed into him of His spirit by sending the angel to him to breathe the spirit into him, and He gave you, O people, the blessing of hearing and sight by which you distinguish between sounds, colors, entities, and persons, and the blessing of reason by which you distinguish between good and evil, beneficial and harmful. Little do you thank your Lord for what He has bestowed upon you.
m-0813	The polytheists who deny the resurrection say, “When our flesh and bones have become dust in the earth, will a new creation be raised up?” They reject this, not seeking to reach the truth. Rather, it is injustice and stubbornness on their part, because they are disbelievers in meeting their Lord on the Day of Resurrection. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, “The Angel of Death who is assigned to you will take your souls when your appointed times have come to an end, and you will not be delayed for a single moment. Then you will be returned to your Lord, and He will reward you for all your deeds, if good, then good, and if evil, then evil.” And if you could but see, O you who are being addressed, when the criminals who denied the resurrection lower their heads before their Lord out of shame and disgrace, saying, “Our Lord, we have seen our ugliness and heard from You the confirmation of what Your messengers used to command us in this world, and we have repented to You, so return us to this world so that we may work in it in Your obedience. Indeed, we have now become certain of what we used to deny in this world, of Your Oneness and that You will resurrect those in the graves.” And if you could see, O you who are addressing, all of that, you would see a great matter and a grave matter. And if We had willed, We could have given these people The polytheists are guided and guided to faith, but the word from Me is true and obligatory, and I will fill Hell with people of disbelief and sins from among the jinn and all mankind, because they chose misguidance over guidance. It will be said to these polytheists when they enter Hell, “Taste the punishment because of your heedlessness of the Hereafter and your immersion in the pleasures of this world. Indeed, We have left you today in torment, and taste the torment of Hell that will not cease because of what you did in this world of disbelief in God and sins against Him.”
m-0814	Only those who believe in the verses of the Qur’an and act upon them are those who, when they are admonished by them or they are recited to them, prostrate themselves before their Lord in humility and obedience, and glorify Allah in their prostration with His praise, and they are not too proud to prostrate themselves before Him and to worship Him alone, with no partner or associate. The sides of those who believe in the verses of Allah rise from their beds of sleep, praying to their Lord in the night prayer, calling upon their Lord out of fear of punishment and hope for reward, and from what We have provided them they spend in the obedience of Allah and in His cause. No soul knows what Allah has stored for these believers that will delight the eye and open the chest as a reward for their righteous deeds.
m-0815	"Is he who was obedient to Allah and His Messenger, believing in His promise and His threat, like he who disbelieved in Allah and His Messengers and denied the Last Day? They are not equal in the sight of Allah.

As for those who believed in Allah and did what they were commanded, their reward is gardens to which they will take refuge and dwell in their delights, as a hospitality for them, as a reward for what they used to do in this world in obedience to Him.

As for those who disobeyed Allah and committed sins, their abode is Hell. Whenever they want to leave it, they will be returned to it and it will be said to them, as a rebuke and a rebuke, “Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny in this world.”

And We will surely make these wicked and disbelieving people taste the lesser punishment of trials, tribulations and calamities in this world before the greater punishment on the Day of Resurrection, when they will be tormented in the fire of Hell, perhaps they will return and repent from their sins.

And no one is more unjust to himself than he who was admonished by the proofs of Allah, then turned away from all that, so he did not learn from His admonitions, but rather was arrogant about them. Indeed, we are among the criminals who turned away from the signs of Allah and His proofs and did not benefit. It has avengers"
m-0816	"And We gave Moses the Torah just as We gave you, O Messenger, the Qur’an, so do not be in doubt about meeting Moses on the Night of the Isra’ and Mi’raj. And We made the Torah a guidance for the Children of Israel, calling them to the truth and to a straight path. And We made from the Children of Israel guides and callers to goodness, whom people would follow and call them to monotheism and worship of Allah alone and obey Him. They only attained this high degree when they were patient with Allah’s commands and abandoned His prohibitions and called to Him and endured harm in His path and were certain of Allah’s signs and proofs. Indeed, your Lord, O Messenger, will judge between the believers and the disbelievers from the Children of Israel and others on the Day of Resurrection with justice in matters of religion in which they differed. He will reward every person according to his deeds by admitting the people of Paradise to Paradise and the people of Hell to Hell. Has it not become clear to these disbelievers in the Messenger how many nations We destroyed before them, walking in their dwellings and seeing them with their own eyes, like the people of Hud, Salih, and Lot? Indeed in that are signs and admonitions by which the truth of the messengers that came to them is proven and the falsehood of what they are upon of polytheism. Will these disbelievers not hear of the messengers? God’s sermons and arguments, so that they may benefit from them
Have not those who deny the resurrection after death seen that We drive the water to the dry, rough land in which there is no vegetation, and We produce thereby crops of varying colors from which their livestock eat and their bodies are nourished, and they live by it? Will they not see these blessings with their own eyes and know that God, who did this, is able to revive the dead and raise them from their graves?"
m-0817	These polytheists hasten the punishment of Allah, saying, “When will this judgment be that will decide between us and you, that we will be punished, according to your claim, if you are truthful in your claim?” Say to them, O Messenger, “On the Day of Judgment, on which your punishment will befall you and you will see death, the faith of the disbelievers will not benefit them, nor will they be delayed for repentance and review.” So, O Messenger, turn away from these polytheists and do not care about their denial, and await what Allah will do with them. They are waiting and lying in wait for you to cause evil. So Allah will disgrace them and humiliate them and give you victory over them. And He has done so, and to Him is praise and thanks.
m-0818	O Prophet, continue to fear Allah by acting according to His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. Let the believers follow your example, for they are more in need of that than you. Do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is All-Knowing of all things, Wise in His creation, command, and management. And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord of the Qur’an and the Sunnah. Indeed, Allah is aware of everything you do and will reward you for it. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. And rely on your Lord and entrust all your affairs to Him. He is sufficient for you as a protector for those who trust in Him and turn to Him.
m-0819	Allah has not made for any human being two hearts in his chest, nor has He made your wives whom you declare to be sacred like your mothers. Zihar is when a man says to his wife, “You are to me like the back of my mother.” This was a divorce in the days of ignorance, so Allah made it clear that a wife does not become a mother in any case. Allah did not make adopted children sons in the Sharia, rather Zihar and adoption have no reality in terms of eternal prohibition, so the wife from whom Zihar is declared is not like the mother in terms of sanctity. Lineage is not established by adoption from a person saying to an adopted son, “This is my son.” This is verbal talk that has no reality and is not taken into account. Allah, the Exalted, speaks the truth and shows His servants His path and guides them to the path of righteousness. Attribute your adopted sons to their fathers, that is more just and upright in the sight of Allah. If you do not know their real fathers, then call them by the brotherhood of religion that unites you with them, for they are your brothers in religion and your clients in it. There is no sin upon you for any mistake you made that you did not do intentionally, but Allah will hold you accountable if you did so intentionally. And Allah is Forgiving to those who err, Merciful to those who repent from their sin. The Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, is closer to the believers than they are to themselves in matters of religion and the world. The sanctity of the wives of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, over his nation is like the sanctity of their mothers, so it is not permissible to marry the wives of the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, after him. The relatives among the Muslims are more entitled to inherit from each other in the ruling of God and His law than inheritance by faith and migration. In the beginning of Islam, the Muslims inherited from each other by migration and faith without kinship, then that was abrogated by the verse of inheritance, unless you, O Muslims, do to non-heirs a good deed by supporting, righteousness, maintaining ties, doing good, and making a will. This ruling mentioned was decreed and written in the Preserved Tablet, so you must act upon it. The verse states that the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, is more beloved to the servant than his own self, and that complete obedience to him is obligatory. It states that the Mothers of the Believers, his wives, may God bless him and grant him peace, are obligatory, and that whoever insults them has incurred loss.
m-0820	And remember, O Prophet, when We took from the prophets a firm covenant to convey the message, and We took the covenant from you and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus, the son of Mary - they were the messengers of strong will, according to the well-known. And We took from them a firm covenant to convey the message and to fulfill the trust and to be truthful to one another. God took that covenant from those messengers so that He might question the messengers about what their nations had answered them, so God would reward the believers with Paradise, and He has prepared for the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection a severe punishment in Hell.
m-0821	"O believers, remember the blessing of Allah Almighty that He bestowed upon you in Medina during the days of the Battle of the Confederates, which is the Battle of the Trench, when the polytheists from outside the city, and the Jews and hypocrites from Medina and its surroundings, gathered against you and surrounded you. Then We sent upon the confederates a violent wind that uprooted their tents and threw away their cooking pots. And We sent angels from the heaven that you did not see, so terror fell into their hearts. And Allah is Seeing of what you do. Nothing of that is hidden from Him.

Remember when they came upon you from above you, from the top of the valley from the east, and from below you, from the bottom of the valley from the west, and when the eyes were staring in intense confusion and astonishment, and the hearts reached the throats from the intensity of terror, and despair overcame the hypocrites, and the sayings increased, and you thought evil thoughts about Allah that He would not support His religion or make His word supreme.

In that difficult situation, the faith of the believers was tested, and the people were tested, and the believer was distinguished from the hypocrite, and they were greatly disturbed with fear and anxiety so that their faith would be clear and their certainty would increase.

And when He says The hypocrites and those in whose hearts there is doubt and they are weak in faith, what Allah and His Messenger have promised us of victory and empowerment is nothing but falsehood and delusion, so do not believe it.

And remember, O Prophet, the statement of a group of hypocrites calling to the believers from the people of Medina, “O people of Yathrib,” which is the old name for Medina, you will not stay in a losing battle, so return to your homes inside the city. And another group of hypocrites asked permission from the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to return to their homes, claiming that they were not fortified and they feared for them, but the truth is that they were not like that, and their only intention by that was to flee from the fighting.

If the army of the parties had entered Medina from its sides and then these hypocrites were asked about associating partners with Allah and turning away from Islam, they would have responded to that immediately, and they would not have delayed from associating partners with Allah except a little.

And these hypocrites had made a covenant with Allah through His Messenger before the Battle of the Trench that they would not flee if they witnessed the war nor delay if they were called to jihad, but they betrayed their covenant and Allah will hold them accountable for that and will ask them about that covenant, and the covenant of Allah is responsible for it and will be held accountable for it.

Say, O Prophet, to these hypocrites, “No, I will not Fleeing from battle for fear of death or being killed will not benefit you, for that will not delay your appointed time. If you flee, you will not enjoy in this world except for the limited amount of your lifespan, which is a very short time compared to the Hereafter. Say, O Prophet, to them: Who is it that can protect you from God or protect you from His punishment if He intends for you evil or intends for you mercy? Indeed, He is the Giver, the Withholder, the Harmer, the Beneficial. And these hypocrites will not find for themselves besides God any protector to befriend them or any helper to aid them."
m-0822	"Allah knows those who discourage people from jihad in the way of Allah and say to their brothers, ""Come and join us and leave Muhammad and do not witness any fighting with him, for we fear for you that you will perish with his perishing."" And despite their discouragement, they only come to battle rarely, out of hypocrisy, reputation, and fear of scandal. They are stingy with you, O believers, with money, soul, effort, and affection, because of the enmity and hatred in their souls, out of love for life and hatred for death. When the battle is present, they fear perishing, and you see them looking at you, their eyes rolling because their minds are gone, fearing being killed and fleeing from it, like the eyes of someone who is present at death. When the war ends and the terror is gone, they throw sharp, hurtful tongues at you. And you see them, when dividing the spoils, stingy and envious. Those are the ones who did not believe in their hearts, so Allah took away the reward of their deeds, and that is easy for Allah. The hypocrites think that the parties whom Allah defeated in the worst way did not go away, because of the intensity of their fear and cowardice. If the parties returned to Medina, those hypocrites would wish that they had been absent from Medina among the Bedouins. They inquire about your news and ask about your information. If they were among you, they would not have fought with you except a little, due to their great cowardice, humiliation, and weak faith."
m-0823	You, O believers, have had in the sayings, actions and conditions of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, a good example to follow, so adhere to his Sunnah, for only he who hopes for Allah and the Last Day and frequently remembers Allah, seeks His forgiveness and thanks Him in every situation follows it and follows it. When the believers saw the parties that had gathered around Madinah and surrounded it, they remembered that the time of victory was near, so they said: This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us of trial, tribulation and victory. So Allah fulfilled His promise and His Messenger was truthful in what he gave them. Looking at the parties only increased their faith in Allah, submission to His judgment and obedience to His command. Among the believers are men who fulfilled their covenants with Allah the Most High and were patient in hardship and distress and in times of battle. Among them are those who fulfilled their vows and were martyred in the way of Allah or died in sincerity and loyalty. Among them are those who await one of the two good things: victory or martyrdom. They did not change the covenant of Allah, nor did they break it, nor did they alter it, as the hypocrites did. So Allah may reward the people of truth because of their truthfulness and their trials, and they are the believers, and punish the hypocrites if He wills to punish them. That He does not guide them to sincere repentance before death, so they die in disbelief and deserve Hellfire, or that He forgives them by guiding them to repentance and turning back. Indeed, God is Forgiving of the sins of those who transgress against themselves if they repent, Merciful to them, as He guides them to sincere repentance.
m-0824	Allah returned the parties of disbelief from Medina disappointed, losing and angry, having attained no good in this world or in the Hereafter. Allah sufficed the believers in fighting with the means He had supported them with. Allah is Powerful, He cannot be overcome or subdued, Mighty in His kingdom and authority. Allah brought down the Jews of Banu Qurayzah from their fortresses for their assistance to the parties in fighting the Muslims, and He cast fear into their hearts, so they were defeated. You killed a group of them and took another group captive. Allah gave you, O believers, their land, their dwellings, and their movable property, such as jewelry, weapons, livestock, and immovable property, such as farms, houses, and impregnable fortresses. He gave you inheritance of a land that you had not been able to tread before because of its strength and its pride among its people. Allah is capable of all things, nothing is beyond His power.
m-0825	O Prophet, say to your wives who have gathered around you asking you for more support: If you desire the life of this world and its adornments, then come. I will provide for you something of what I have of this world and part from you without harm or injury. But if you desire the pleasure of Allah and the pleasure of His Messenger and what Allah has prepared for you in the home of the Hereafter, then be patient over what you are doing and obey Allah and His Messenger. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the good-doers among you a great reward. And they have chosen Allah and His Messenger and what Allah has prepared for them in the home of the Hereafter. O wives of the Prophet, whoever among you commits an apparent sin, the punishment will be doubled for her twice. Since their status is high, it is fitting that Allah should make the punishment of the sin committed by them severe, in order to protect their position and the position of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). That punishment is easy for Allah. And whoever among you obeys Allah and His Messenger and does what Allah has commanded, We will give her the reward of her work twice as much as the reward of any other woman, and We have prepared for her a noble provision, which is Paradise.
m-0826	O wives of the Prophet Muhammad, you are not like other women in virtue and status if you act in obedience to Allah and stay away from His disobedience. Do not speak to strangers in a soft voice that would tempt those in whose hearts there is immorality and sickness to unlawful desires. This is an etiquette that is obligatory for every woman who believes in Allah and the Last Day. Speak a word that is free from suspicion and that is not denied by the Shariah. Stay in your homes and do not leave them except for a need. Do not display your charms as the women of the first Jahiliyyah used to do in the times before Islam. This is an address to believing women in every age. O wives of the Prophet, perform the prayers completely at their appointed times and give zakat as Allah has prescribed. Obey Allah and His Messenger in their commands and prohibitions. Allah has only commanded you to do this in order to purify you and keep harm, evil and harm away from you, O family of the Prophet, including his wives and descendants, may Allah’s prayers and peace be upon him. And purify your souls with the utmost purity. Remember what is recited in your homes from the Qur’an and the hadith of the Messenger, may Allah’s prayers and peace be upon him, and act upon it and appreciate it as it should be appreciated, for it is from the blessings of Allah upon you. Allah has been kind to you when He has placed you in houses where the verses of God and the Sunnah are recited. He is well-acquainted with you when He chose you as wives for His Messenger.
m-0827	Verily, those who submit to the commands of Allah and those who submit, those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and those who obey, those who are truthful in their words and those who are truthful, those who are patient in refraining from lusts and in performing acts of obedience and in times of hardship and those who are patient, those who fear Allah and those who fear Him, those who give in charity in the obligatory and voluntary acts and those who give in charity, those who fast in the obligatory and voluntary acts and those who fast, those who guard their private parts from fornication and its preliminaries and from exposing private parts and those who guard, those who remember Allah much with their hearts and tongues and those who remember - Allah has prepared for these forgiveness for their sins and a great reward, which is Paradise.
m-0828	"And it is not appropriate for a believing man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed concerning them, to disobey it by choosing other than that which they have decreed concerning them. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has clearly strayed from the path of righteousness. And when you said, O Prophet, to the one upon whom Allah has bestowed the favor of Islam, and he is Zayd ibn Haritha, whom the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had freed and adopted, and you had bestowed the favor of emancipation upon him, “Keep your wife Zaynab bint Jahsh and do not divorce her, and fear Allah, O Zayd.” And you concealed, O Muhammad, in your soul what Allah had revealed to you about Zayd’s divorce of his wife and your marriage to her, and Allah, the Most High, will reveal what you have concealed, and you feared the hypocrites lest they say, “Muhammad married the divorced wife of his adopted son,” and Allah, the Most High, is more deserving of your fear. So when Zayd had satisfied his need of her and divorced her and her waiting period had expired, We married her to you so that she might be an example in abolishing the custom of forbidding marriage to the wife of an adopted son after her divorce, and there would be no sin or guilt upon the believers in marrying the wives of those whom they had adopted after their divorce if they had satisfied their need of them, and the command of Allah was to be carried out, with no obstacle. 335
There was no sin on the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, for what God made lawful for him of marrying a woman whom he adopted after divorcing her, just as He made it lawful for the prophets before him. It was God’s way with those who passed away before him. God’s command was a predestined decree that must happen.

Then God Almighty mentioned the past prophets and praised them for being the ones who conveyed God’s messages to the people and feared God alone and did not fear anyone else. God is sufficient to hold His servants accountable for all their deeds and to watch over them.

Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets. There is no prophethood after him until the Day of Resurrection. And God is All-Knowing of all your deeds. Nothing is hidden from Him."
m-0829	"O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, remember Allah with your hearts, tongues and limbs frequently and occupy your time with the remembrance of Allah Almighty in the morning and evening and after the obligatory prayers and during emergencies and causes, for that is a prescribed act of worship that calls for the love of Allah and restrains the tongue from sins and helps in every good

He is the One who has mercy on you and praises you and His angels pray for you to bring you out from the darkness of ignorance and misguidance to the light of Islam, and He is Merciful to the believers in this world and the Hereafter, and He does not punish them as long as they are obedient and sincere to Him

The greeting of these believers from Allah in Paradise on the day they meet Him is peace and safety for them from the punishment of Allah, and He has prepared for them A good reward, which is Paradise."

The greeting of these believers from Allah in Paradise on the day they meet Him is peace and security for them from the punishment of Allah. He has prepared for them a good reward, which is Paradise. O Prophet, indeed We have sent you as a witness over your nation by conveying the message to them and bringing good tidings to the believers among them of mercy and Paradise and a warner to the disobedient and the deniers from the Fire and calling to the oneness of Allah and worshipping Him alone by His command. You are a shining lamp for those who are enlightened by you. Your command is clear in what you have brought of the truth like the sun in Its radiance and illumination are denied only by the stubborn

You are a shining lamp for those who are enlightened by you. Your command is clear in what you have brought of the truth like the sun in its radiance and illumination. None denies it except the stubborn
And give good tidings, O Prophet, to the people of faith that they will have a great reward from God, which is the gardens of Paradise
And do not obey, O Messenger, the words of a disbeliever or a hypocrite and leave their harm and do not let that prevent you from conveying the message and trust in God in all your affairs and rely on Him, for He will suffice you in what concerns you of all the affairs of this world and the Hereafter"
m-0831	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if you have contracted marriage with women and have not consummated the marriage with them and then divorced them before you have had sexual intercourse with them, then you have no waiting period for them to count. So give them from your wealth a provision which they may enjoy according to their means, as a consolation to their feelings, and release them with beautiful concealment without harm or injury. O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful for you your wives to whom you have given their dowries, and We have made lawful for you those whom your right hand possesses of slave girls from what Allah has bestowed upon you, and We have made lawful for you marriage to the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you, and We have made lawful for you a believing woman who has given herself to you without a dowry if you wish to marry her exclusively for you. And no one else may marry a woman by gift. We have already made known what We have made obligatory upon the believers concerning their wives and slave girls, that they should not marry more than four women and whatever they wish of slave girls, and the stipulation of a guardian, a dowry, and witnesses against them. But We have made it easy for you in that. Unless it is made easy for others, lest your chest become constricted in marrying those you have married from these categories. And Allah is Forgiving of the sins of His believing servants, Merciful in making it easy for them. You may delay whomever you wish from your wives in the division of the night, and you may take with you whomever you wish from them, and whoever you ask from those whose division you have delayed, there is no sin upon you in this. This choice is closer to their rejoicing and not grieving, and they will all be satisfied with what you have apportioned to them. And Allah knows what is in the hearts of men of their inclination toward some women rather than others. And Allah is Knowing of what is in the hearts, Forbearing, and does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him. It is not permissible for you to take women after your wives who are in your protection and those whom We have permitted to you, and they are those mentioned in the previous verse, number 50 of this surah. And whoever is in your protection from the mentioned women, it is not permissible for you to divorce her in the future and bring another in her place, even if her beauty pleases you. As for adding to your wives without divorcing one of them, there is no blame upon you. As for what your right hand possesses of female slaves, it is permissible for you to take from them whomever you wish. And Allah is Ever-Aware of what is in the hearts. He is Forbearing, and does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him. Everything is watched over by a watcher who knows nothing.
m-0832	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except with his permission to eat food, not waiting for it to be cooked. But when you are invited, then enter, and when you have eaten, then leave without seeking comfort in a conversation between you. For your waiting and seeking comfort will annoy the Prophet, and he will be ashamed to send you out of the houses, although that is his right. And Allah is not ashamed to explain and make known the truth. And if you ask the wives of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, for something of the utensils of the house and the like, then ask them from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts than the thoughts that occur to men in the matter of women and to women in the matter of men. Seeing is a cause of temptation. And it is not appropriate for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah, nor to marry his wives after his death ever, because they are your mothers. And it is not permissible for a man to marry his mother. If the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, annoys you, and your marrying his wives after him is a great sin in the sight of Allah, this nation has complied with this command and avoided what Allah has forbidden. If you reveal anything on your tongues, O people, that which annoys the Messenger of Allah, then it is There is no sin on women for not covering themselves from their fathers, sons, brothers, brothers’ sons, sisters’ sons, believing women, and slaves owned by them, because of their great need for them in service. Fear God, O women, lest you transgress what He has set for you and show of your adornment what you should not show, or abandon the veil in front of those from whom you should cover yourself. Indeed, God is ever, over all things, a witness. He witnesses the deeds of His servants, both outwardly and inwardly, and He will reward them for them.
m-0833	Allah the Almighty praises the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, before the angels who are close to Him, and His angels praise the Prophet and pray for him, “O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, send blessings upon the Messenger of Allah and salute him with a salutation and glorification.” The description of sending blessings upon the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, has been established in the Sunnah in various ways, including: “O Allah, send blessings upon Muhammad and upon the family of Muhammad, as You sent blessings upon the family of Abraham, for You are Praiseworthy and Glorious.” O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as You blessed the family of Abraham, for You are Praiseworthy and Glorious. Those who harm Allah through polytheism or other sins, and harm the Messenger of Allah through words or actions, Allah will distance them and expel them from all good in this world and the Hereafter, and He will prepare for them in the Hereafter a punishment that will humiliate and disgrace them. Those who harm believing men and women through words or actions without committing a sin have committed the most heinous lie and falsehood, and have committed a clearly ugly sin for which they deserve punishment in the Hereafter.
m-0834	O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to let down over their heads and faces [part] of their outer garments and their coverings to cover their faces, chests and heads. That is more likely that they will be distinguished by covering and protection, so that no harm or injury will be exposed to them. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful, as He has forgiven you what is past and had mercy upon you by making clear to you what is lawful and what is unlawful.
m-0835	If those who conceal disbelief and outwardly show faith, and those in whose hearts is doubt and suspicion, and those who spread false news in the city of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), do not desist from their ugly deeds and evils, We will surely give you power over them. Then they will not reside with you therein except for a short time, banished from the mercy of Allah wherever they are found, captured and killed in a slaying, as long as they persist in hypocrisy and spreading false news among the Muslims for the purpose of sedition and corruption. The law and method of Allah with the hypocrites of previous nations is that they will be captured and killed wherever they are, and you will not find, O Prophet, any change or alteration in the way of Allah.
m-0836	"People ask you, O Messenger, about the time of the Resurrection, rejecting and denying it. Say to them, ""The knowledge of the Hour is with Allah only. And what makes you know, O Messenger? Perhaps its time is near. Indeed, Allah has expelled the disbelievers from His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, and has prepared for them in the Hereafter a blazing Fire, intensely hot, wherein they will abide forever. They will find no protector to protect them and defend them, nor any helper to aid them, and bring them out of the Fire. On the Day when the faces of the disbelievers will be turned over in the Fire, they will say, regretful and bewildered, ""If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed His Messenger in this world, then we would have been among the people of Paradise."" Indeed, Allah has expelled the disbelievers from His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, and has prepared for them in the Hereafter a blazing Fire, intensely hot, wherein they will abide forever. They will find no protector to protect them and defend them, nor any helper to aid them, and bring them out of the Fire. On the Day when the faces of the disbelievers will be turned over in the Fire, they will say, regretful and bewildered, ""If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed His Messenger in this world, then we would have been among the people of Paradise."" Therein they will never find a protector or protector, nor a helper to aid them and bring them out of the Fire. On the Day when the faces of the disbelievers will be turned over in the Fire, they will say, regretful and perplexed, “Oh, if only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed His Messenger in this world, then we would have been among the people of Paradise.” The disbelievers will say on the Day of Resurrection, “Our Lord, indeed we obeyed our leaders in misguidance and our elders in polytheism, and they led us away from the path of guidance and faith. Our Lord, punish them with a punishment like that with which You have punished us, and expel them from Your mercy with a severe expulsion.” This is evidence that obeying other than Allah in disobeying His command and the command of His Messenger leads to the wrath and punishment of Allah, and that the follower and the followed share in the punishment, so let the Muslim beware of that. The disbelievers will say on the Day of Resurrection, “Our Lord, indeed we obeyed our leaders in misguidance and our elders in polytheism, and they led us away from the path of guidance and faith. Our Lord, punish them with a punishment like that with which You have punished us, and expel them from Your mercy with a severe expulsion.” This is evidence that obeying other than Allah in disobeying His command and the command of his Messenger are a cause for God’s wrath and punishment, and the follower and the followed are both partners in the punishment, so let the Muslim beware of that."
m-0837	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not harm the Messenger of Allah by word or deed, and do not be like those who harmed the Prophet of Allah, Moses. Allah cleared him of what they said about him of lies and falsehood, and he was of great status and prestige with Allah. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, act in obedience to Him and avoid disobeying Him, lest you deserve punishment for that, and say in all your circumstances and affairs words that are upright and in accordance with what is right, free from lies and falsehood. If you fear Allah and speak words that are right, Allah will set right your deeds for you and forgive your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger in what He has commanded and forbidden has certainly attained the greatest honor in this world and the Hereafter.
m-0838	Indeed, We offered the trust which Allah had entrusted to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, but they declined to bear it and feared that they would not be able to fulfill it. And man bore it and committed himself to it despite his weakness. Indeed, he was extremely unjust and ignorant of himself. And man bore the trust so that Allah might punish the hypocrites who outwardly show Islam and conceal their disbelief, and the hypocrite women, and the polytheists in worshipping Allah other than Him, and that Allah might accept the repentance of the believing men and believing women by covering up their sins and leaving their punishment. And Allah is Forgiving to the repentant among His servants, Merciful to them.
m-0839	Praise be to God for His attributes, all of which are descriptions of perfection, and for His apparent and hidden blessings, religious and worldly, to whom belongs the kingdom of whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and to Him belongs complete praise in the Hereafter. He is the Wise in His actions, the All-Aware of the affairs of His creation. He knows everything that enters the earth from drops of water and what emerges from it from plants, minerals, and water, and what descends from the sky from rain, and the angels and books, and what ascends to them from the angels, and the actions of creation. He is the Most Merciful to His servants, so He does not hasten to punish their disobedient ones. He is the Forgiver of the sins of those who repent to Him and trust in Him.
m-0840	"The disbelievers who deny the Resurrection say, ""The Resurrection will not come to us."" Say to them, ""O Messenger, yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you, but no one knows the time of its coming except Allah, the Knower of the unseen, from whom nothing is hidden in the heavens or the earth, nor anything smaller or greater, but it is written in a clear Book, and it is the Preserved Tablet, that He may reward those who have believed in Allah and followed His Messenger and done righteous deeds. Those will have forgiveness for their sins and noble provision, and it is Paradise."" And the disbelievers who deny the Resurrection say, ""The Resurrection will not come to us."" Say to them, ""O Messenger, yes, by my Lord, it will surely come to you, but no one knows the time of its coming except Allah, the Knower of the unseen, from whom nothing is hidden in the heavens or the earth, nor anything smaller or greater, but it is written in a clear Book, and it is the Preserved Tablet, that He may reward those who have believed in Allah and followed His Messenger and done righteous deeds. Those will have forgiveness for their sins and noble provision, and it is Paradise."" And those who strive to avert [people] from the way of Allah and to deny His Messengers and to invalidate Our verses, defying Allah and overpowering His command, those will have the worst and most severe punishment. pain"
m-0841	"And those who have been given knowledge know that the Qur’an which has been sent down to you from your Lord is the truth and guides to the path of Allah, the Almighty, who cannot be overcome or prevented, but rather He has subdued everything and has overcome the Praiseworthy in His words, deeds and laws.

And those who disbelieve say to one another in mockery, “Shall we direct you to a man - they mean Muhammad - who tells you that when you die and your bodies are dispersed, you will be brought back to life and raised from your graves?” They say that out of their extreme denial.

This man has fabricated a lie against Allah or is he mad, so he speaks about what he does not know. The matter is not as the disbelievers say, but Muhammad is the most truthful of the truthful. And those who do not believe in the resurrection and do not work for it are in eternal torment in the Hereafter and are in misguidance far from the truth in this world.

Have these disbelievers who do not believe in the Hereafter not seen the greatness of Allah’s power in what is before them and behind them of the heaven and the earth, which dazzles the minds, and that they have encompassed them, if We will, We can cause the earth to swallow them up as We did with Qarun, or send down upon them pieces of torment as We did with the people of Shuaib, the sky rained fire upon them and burned them. Indeed, in that which We have mentioned of Our power is a clear proof for every servant who returns to his Lord in repentance, acknowledges His oneness, and is sincere in worship of Him."
m-0842	"And We gave David prophethood and a book and knowledge, and We said to the mountains and the birds, ""Glorify God with him."" And We made iron soft for him, and it was like dough, so he could dispose of it as he wished. ""Make perfect and wide breastplates, and measure the nails in the rings of the breastplates. Do not make the rings small, lest they weaken and the breastplates be unable to defend, nor make them large, lest they become heavy for the wearer. And work, O David, you and your family, in obedience to God. Indeed, I am Seeing of what you do. Nothing of it is hidden from Me."" And We subjected to Solomon the wind, running from the beginning of the day until midday, a month's journey, and from midday until nightfall, a month's journey, at the usual pace. And We made copper flow for him as water flows, so that he could do with it what he pleased. And We subjected to him some of the jinn who worked before him by permission of his Lord. And whoever of them turned away from Our command which We commanded him in obedience to Solomon, We will make him taste of the punishment of the blazing Fire. The jinn made for Solomon whatever he pleased of mosques for worship, and statues of copper and glass, and large bowls like basins in which water collects, and fixed pots that do not move from their places because of their size. And We said, O family of David, work in gratitude to God for what He has given him. He gave you that by obeying Him and complying with His command. Few of My servants are those who thank God much. David and his family were among the few."
m-0843	So when We decreed death for Solomon, nothing indicated to the jinn his death except the termites eating away at his staff on which he was leaning. So Solomon fell to the ground. At that the jinn knew that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in the humiliating punishment and hard work for Solomon, thinking that he was among the living. And in this verse there is a refutation of the belief of some people that the jinn know the unseen, for if they had known the unseen, they would have known of the death of Solomon, peace be upon him, and they would not have remained in the humiliating punishment.
m-0844	"The tribe of Saba in Yemen had in their dwelling a sign of Our power, two gardens on the right and on the left. Eat of the provision of your Lord and be grateful to Him for His blessings upon you. Indeed, your land is a noble land and pleasant air, and your Lord is Forgiving of you. But they turned away from the command of Allah and His thanks and denied the messengers, so We sent upon them a violent torrential flood that destroyed the dam and drowned the gardens. And We replaced their two fruitful gardens with two gardens of bitter fruit, which is an unpleasant taste, and tamarisk, which is a tree similar to the tamarisk that has no fruit, and a few jujube trees with many thorns. That change from good to evil was due to their disbelief and lack of gratitude for the blessings of Allah. And We do not punish with this severe punishment except the one who is excessive in his disbelief. His actions are recompensed like for like. But they turned away from the command of Allah and His thanks and denied the messengers, so We sent upon them a violent torrential flood that destroyed the dam and drowned the gardens. And We replaced their two fruitful gardens with two gardens of bitter fruit, which is an unpleasant taste, and tamarisk, which is a tree similar to the tamarisk that has no fruit. Fruit for him and a little of the jujube tree with many thorns. This change from good to evil is due to their disbelief and their lack of gratitude for the blessings of Allah. We do not punish with this severe punishment except the one who is excessively ungrateful in disbelief. His actions are recompensed like for like. And We made between the people of Sheba, who are in Yemen, and the towns which We blessed, which are the Levant, connected cities, some of which can be seen from others. And We made the journey in them a measured journey from one home to another, with no difficulty in it. And We said to them, ""Travel in those towns at any time you wish, by night or by day, in security, not fearing an enemy or hunger or thirst."" But in their transgression they grew tired of comfort and security and the ease of life, and they said, ""Our Lord, make our towns far apart so that our journey between them will be long, so that we will not find populous towns on our way."" And they wronged themselves with their disbelief, so We destroyed them and made them examples and stories for those who come after them. And We dispersed them with all dispersion, and their land was destroyed. Indeed, in what happened to Sheba is a lesson for everyone who is patient in the face of hardships and difficulties, grateful for the blessings of Allah Almighty."
m-0845	And Iblis thought, with an uncertain thought, that he would lead the children of Adam astray and that they would obey him in disobeying Allah. So his thought came true about them, so they obeyed him and disobeyed their Lord, except for a group of the believers in Allah, for they remained steadfast in obeying Allah. And Iblis had no power over these disbelievers to disbelieve, but the wisdom of Allah required him to suggest to the children of Adam to show what He knew from eternity, so that We might distinguish those who believe in the resurrection, reward, and punishment from those who are in doubt about that. And your Lord is Guardian over all things, preserving it and rewarding for it. Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists: Call upon those whom you claimed to be partners with Allah, so you worshipped them besides Him, from idols, angels, and human beings, and seek them in your needs, for they will not answer you, for they do not possess the weight of a small ant in the heavens or on the earth, and they have no partner in either of them. And none of these polytheists can help Allah in creating anything, rather Allah, the Most High, is the One Who is unique in creating, for He is the One Who is worshipped alone, and no one else deserves to be worshipped. And the intercession of the intercessor will not benefit. With God Almighty, except for those whom He permits. And from His greatness and majesty, the Almighty and Majestic, is that when He, glory be to Him, speaks with revelation and the people of the heavens hear His words, they tremble with awe until they are overcome by something like fainting. Then when the terror has gone from their hearts, they ask one another, “What did your Lord say?” The angels say, “He said the truth, and He is the Most High in His essence, His power, and the loftiness of His great power over all things.”
m-0846	Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists: Who provides for you from the heavens with rain and from the earth with plants and minerals and other things? They must acknowledge that He is Allah. If they do not acknowledge that, then say to them: Allah is the Provider. And indeed, one of the two parties, from us and from you, is upon guidance firmly established in it or in clear error immersed in it. Say: You will not be asked about our sins, nor will we be asked about your deeds, for we are innocent of you and your disbelief. Say: Our Lord will gather us and you on the Day of Resurrection, then He will judge between us with justice. He is the Opener, the Judge between His creation, the Knower of what should be judged, and of the conditions of His creation. Nothing is hidden from Him. Say: Show me with proof and evidence those whom you have associated with Allah and made partners with Him in worship. Have they created anything? The matter is not as they have described. Rather, He is the One truly worshipped, Who has no partner, the Mighty in His vengeance against those who associate partners with Him, the Wise in His words and deeds and in managing the affairs of His creation.
m-0847	"And We have not sent you, O Messenger, except to all mankind, as a bringer of good tidings of the reward of Allah and a warner of His punishment, but most of the people do not know the truth, so they turn away from it.

And these polytheists say, mockingly, “When will this promise which you promise us come to pass, that Allah will gather us together on it and then judge between us, if you are truthful in what you promise us?”

Say to them, O Messenger, “You have an appointment that will surely come to you, and it is the appointment of the Day of Resurrection. You will not delay it an hour for repentance, nor will you advance it an hour before it for punishment. So beware of that Day and prepare for it.”"
m-0848	"And those who disbelieve say, ""We will not believe in this Qur'an, nor in what preceded it of the Torah, the Gospel, and the Psalms."" Indeed, they have denied all the Books of Allah. And if you could but see, O Messenger, when the wrongdoers are detained before their Lord for the reckoning, exchanging speech among themselves, each blaming the other, you would have seen a terrible thing. The oppressed will say to those who were arrogant - and they are the leaders and chiefs who are astray and misguided - ""If it were not for you who led us astray from guidance, we would have believed in Allah and His Messenger."" The leaders will say to those who were oppressed, ""Did we prevent you from guidance after it had come to you? Rather, you were criminals when you entered into disbelief of your own free will."" And the oppressed will say to their leaders who were astray, ""Rather, it was your evil planning against us by night and by day that caused us to fall into destruction. So you used to ask us to disbelieve in Allah and make partners for Him in worship."" And the grief of both parties will be filled with them when they see the punishment that has been prepared for them, and We have placed shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved. They are not punished with this punishment except because of their disbelief in Allah and their evil deeds in this world and in the Hereafter."" The verse is a strong warning against following the advocates of misguidance and the imams of tyranny."
m-0849	"And We did not send to any city a messenger calling to the Oneness of Allah and to worship Him alone except that those immersed in pleasures and desires among its people said, ""Indeed, we are ungrateful for what you have brought, O Messengers."" And they said, ""We are more in wealth and children than you. And Allah has not given us these blessings except to please Him. And we will not be punished in this world or in the Hereafter."" Say to them, O Messenger, ""Indeed, my Lord expands provision in this world for whom He wills of His servants and restricts it for whom He wills, not out of love or hatred, but He does that as a test. But most people do not know that this is a test for His servants because they do not contemplate. And it is not your wealth or your children that bring you closer to Us and raise your ranks. But whoever believes in Allah and does righteous deeds - for them is double the reward of good deeds, so the good deed is ten times its like, up to whatever increase Allah wills. They are in the highest levels of Paradise, safe from punishment, death, and sorrows. And those who strive to invalidate our proofs and avert [people] from the path of Allah, making trouble and overpowering [others] - these are in the punishment of Hell on the Day of Resurrection, attended by the guards of Hell. They will not leave it. Say, O Messenger, to those who are deceived by wealth and children: My Lord expands provision for whomever He wills of His servants and restricts it for whomever He wills for a reason that He knows. And whatever you give of what He has commanded you, He will compensate you for it in this world with something else and in the Hereafter with reward. And He, glory be to Him, is the best of providers. So seek provision from Him alone and strive to use the means that He has commanded you to use."
m-0850	And remember, O Messenger, the Day when Allah will gather the polytheists and those worshipped besides Him from among the angels, then He will say to the angels, in a way of rebuke to those who worshipped them, “Did these worship you instead of us?” The angels will say, “We declare You, O Allah, free from having a partner in worship. You are our protector, the one we obey and worship alone. Rather, these used to worship devils; most of them believed in them and obeyed them.” On the Day of Gathering, the worshipped ones will not possess for the worshippers any benefit or harm, and We will say to those who wronged themselves through polytheism and disobedience, “Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny.” And when the clear verses of Allah are recited to the disbelievers of Mecca, they will say, “Muhammad is only a man who wishes to prevent you from worshipping the gods your fathers used to worship.” And they will say, “This Qur’an that you recite to us, O Muhammad, is nothing but a fabricated lie that you have brought from yourself and not from Allah.” And the disbelievers will say about the Qur’an when it has come to them, “This is nothing but obvious magic.” And We have not sent down to the disbelievers any books that they could read before the Qur’an, that would guide them to what they claim, that what they Muhammad brought it to them as magic. We did not send to them before you, O Messenger, any messenger warning them of Our punishment. And those before them, such as Aad and Thamud, denied Our messengers. And the people of Mecca did not attain a tenth of what We gave to the previous nations of strength, abundance of wealth, long life, and other blessings. So they denied My messengers in what they brought them, so We destroyed them. So see, O Messenger, how was My denial of them and My punishment of them.
m-0851	Say, O Messenger, to these stubborn deniers, I only advise you with one thing: that you rise up in obedience to God, two by two and one by one, then reflect on the state of your companion, the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and what has been attributed to him. He has no madness, and it is only a frightening thing for you and a warning of the torment of Hell before you experience its heat. Say, O Messenger, to the disbelievers, I have not asked you for any reward for the good that I have brought you, so it is yours. My reward that I await is only from God, who is aware of my deeds and your deeds. Nothing is hidden from Him, so He rewards everyone according to what he deserves.
m-0852	Say, O Messenger, to those who deny monotheism and the message of Islam, “My Lord casts falsehood with arguments from the truth, so He exposes it and destroys it. And God is the Knower of the unseen. Nothing is hidden from Him on earth or in heaven.” Say, O Messenger, “The truth and the great law have come from God, and falsehood has gone and its authority has diminished, so that falsehood has nothing left to initiate or restore.” Say, “If I deviate from the truth, then the sin of my error is upon myself, and if I remain steadfast upon it, then it is by the revelation of God which He reveals to me. Indeed, my Lord is All-Hearing of what I say to you. He is near to whoever calls upon Him and asks Him.” And if you could but see, O Messenger, when the disbelievers are terrified when they witness the punishment of God, you would see a tremendous matter. There is no escape for them nor a way out, and they are taken to the Fire from a place that is within easy reach. And the disbelievers say when they see the punishment in the Hereafter, “We believe in God and His Books and His Messengers.” How can they attain faith in the Hereafter and reach it from a distant place that has been separated from them? Its place is this world, and they disbelieved in it? They disbelieved in the truth in this world and denied the Messengers, and they cast suspicion from a place far from hitting the truth, in which they have no basis for their suspicion. Falsehood, so there is no way for them to reach the truth, just as there is no way for the shooter to reach the target from a far place. And the infidels were prevented from what they desired of repentance and returning to the world to believe, as God did with their counterparts from the infidels of previous nations. They were in doubt in the world about the matter of the messengers and the resurrection and the reckoning, which caused suspicion and anxiety. Therefore, they did not believe.
m-0853	Praise be to Allah for His attributes, all of which are descriptions of perfection, and for His apparent and hidden blessings, religious and worldly. He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and their originator, who made the angels messengers to whomever He wills of His servants, and for whatever He wills of His commands and prohibitions. And from the great power of Allah is that He made the angels possessors of wings, two, three, and four, with which they fly to convey what Allah has commanded. Allah increases in His creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is capable of all things, nothing is difficult for Him. Whatever Allah opens for people of provision, rain, health, knowledge, and other blessings, no one is able to withhold this mercy, and whatever He withholds of it, no one can send it after Him. Glory be to Him, the Most High. He is the Almighty, the Subduer of all things, the Wise, who sends mercy and withholds it according to His wisdom. O people, remember the blessing of Allah upon you in your hearts, tongues, and limbs. There is no creator for you other than Allah. He provides for you from the sky with rain and from the earth with water, minerals, and other things. There is no god but Him, alone, without partner. So how can you be turned away from His Oneness and worship? And if your people deny you, O Messenger, then messengers before Before you and to God, matters will return in the Hereafter, and He will reward each according to what he deserves. In this there is consolation for the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace.
m-0854	O people, indeed the promise of Allah of resurrection, reward and punishment is a firm truth. So do not let the worldly life deceive you with its desires and demands, and do not let Satan deceive you with Allah. Indeed, Satan is an enemy to the children of Adam, so take him as an enemy and do not obey him. Indeed, Satan is an enemy to the children of Adam, so take him as an enemy and do not obey him. Indeed, Satan is an enemy to the children of Adam. Indeed, Satan is an enemy to the children of Adam, so take him as an enemy and do not obey him. Indeed, he only calls his followers to misguidance that they will be among the companions of the blazing Fire. Those who have denied that Allah is the only true God and have denied what His Messengers have brought will have a severe punishment in the Hereafter. But those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and done righteous deeds will have forgiveness from their Lord and a passover for their sins after they have been covered for them, and they will have a great reward, which is Paradise. Is he for whom Satan has made his evil deeds seem good, such as disobeying Allah, disbelieving in Allah, and worshipping other gods and idols, so he sees them as good and beautiful, like he whom Allah has guided, so he sees the good as good and the bad as bad? Badly, for God misguides whom He wills of His servants and guides whom He wills, so do not destroy yourself with grief over the disbelief of these misguided ones. Indeed, God is All-Knowing of their ugliness and will recompense them for it with the worst recompense.
m-0855	And it is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir up the clouds, and We drive them to a barren land, and the water descends, and We revive thereby the earth after its dryness, and it becomes green with vegetation. Like that revival, Allah will revive the dead on the Day of Resurrection. Whoever seeks honor in this world or the Hereafter, let him seek it from Allah, and it will not be attained except through obedience to Him. For Allah belongs all honor. Whoever seeks honor in the creation, Allah will humiliate him. Whoever seeks honor in the Creator, Allah will honor him. To Him belong glory. His mention will ascend, and righteous deeds will raise him. And those who earn evil deeds will have a severe punishment, and their plotting will destroy and corrupt, and will not benefit them at all. And Allah created your father Adam from dust. Then He made his offspring from an extract of despised water. Then He made you men and women. And no female conceives or gives birth except with His knowledge. And no one lives long, so that his life is prolonged or his life is diminished, except that it is in a book with Him, and that is the Preserved Tablet. Before his mother conceives him and before she gives birth to him, Allah has enumerated all of that and He knew it before He created him. Nothing is added to what He has written for him, nor is anything diminished. Indeed, He created you and He knows your conditions and their writing in the Preserved Tablet is easy and simple for Allah.
m-0856	And the two seas are not alike. One is fresh, very fresh, and easily passes through the throat, relieving thirst. The other is salty, very salty. From each of the two seas you eat fresh fish, delicious in taste, and you extract adornments, which are pearls and coral, which you wear. And you see ships therein fording the waters, that you may seek of His bounty in trade and other things. In this is evidence of the power of Allah and His Oneness. Perhaps you will thank Allah for these blessings that He has bestowed upon you. And Allah brings some of the hours of the night into the day, and He increases the day in proportion to what was missing from the night, and He brings some of the hours of the day into the night, and He increases the night in proportion to what was missing from the day. And He has subjected the sun and the moon, running their course for a known time. He is the One who has done this. He is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs all dominion. And those whom you worship besides Allah do not possess so much as a date stone, which is the thin white shell that is on the kernel. If you, O people, call upon these deities besides Allah, they do not hear your call, and if they heard, hypothetically, they would not answer you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown you. And no one will tell you, O Messenger, who is more truthful than Allah, the All-Knowing, the All-Aware.
m-0857	O people, you are the ones who need Allah in everything, you cannot do without Him for the blink of an eye, and He, glory be to Him, is independent of people and of every thing of His creation, the Praiseworthy in His Essence, His Names and Attributes, the Praised for His blessings, for every blessing to people is from Him, so to Him is praise and thanks in every situation. If Allah wills, He can destroy you, O people, and bring another people who obey Him and worship Him alone. Your destruction and the bringing of a creation other than you is not impossible for Allah, rather, that is easy and simple for Allah. And no sinful soul shall bear the sin of another soul, and if a soul burdened with sins asks who will bear its sins, it will not find anyone who will bear anything for it, even if the one it asked was a relative of its father or brother or the like. You only warn, O Messenger, those who fear the punishment of their Lord in secret and perform the prayer as it should be performed, and whoever purifies himself from polytheism and other sins, he only purifies himself, and to Allah, glory be to Him, is the final destination of the creatures and their destiny, so He rewards each according to what he deserves.

m-0859	Have you not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky, and We water thereby trees on the earth, and We produce from those trees fruits of varying colors, some of them red, some of them black, some of them yellow, and others. And We created from the mountains paths, white and red, of varying colors. And We created from the mountains mountains of intense blackness. And We created from people and beasts, camels, cows, and sheep, that which is of varying colors, such as red, white, black, and others like the different colors of fruits and mountains. Only those who have knowledge of Him, glory be to Him, His attributes, His law, and His power over all things, including the differences in these creatures despite the unity of their cause, and they ponder the lessons and morals in them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Power, and cannot be overcome. He is Forgiving. He rewards the people of obedience and pardons them.
m-0860	"Those who recite the Qur’an and act upon it, and are constant in prayer at its appointed times, and spend from what We have provided them of the obligatory and recommended types of expenditures, secretly and publicly, these hope thereby to achieve a trade that will never fail or perish, namely, the pleasure of their Lord and the attainment of His abundant reward, so that Allah will fully reward them for their deeds, without any reduction, and will multiply their good deeds for them from His bounty. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of their misdeeds, Appreciative of their good deeds, and will reward them for them abundantly.

Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of their misdeeds, Appreciative of their good deeds, and will reward them abundantly for them.

What We have revealed to you, O Messenger, of the Qur’an is the truth confirming the Books that Allah has revealed. On His messengers before you. Indeed, Allah is All-Aware of the affairs of His servants, and He is All-Seeing of their deeds, and He will reward them for them. Then, after the destruction of the nations, We gave the Qur’an to those We chose from the nation of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Among them were those who wronged themselves by committing some sins, and among them were those who were moderate, who performed the obligatory duties and avoided the forbidden, and among them were those who were foremost in good deeds, by Allah’s permission, that is, those who hastened and strived in righteous deeds, both obligatory and voluntary. This giving of the Book and the selection of this nation is the great bounty.

Perpetual gardens of residence for those to whom Allah has given His Book. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their usual clothing in Paradise will be silk, that is, fine clothing. And they will say, when they enter Paradise, “Praise be to Allah, who has removed from us all sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving, as He has forgiven us our mistakes. Appreciative, as He has accepted from us good deeds and multiplied them. And it is He who has sent us down to the home of Paradise out of His bounty. Neither fatigue nor exhaustion will touch us therein.” ... Take away from us every sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving, as He has forgiven us our mistakes. Appreciative, as He has accepted from us our good deeds and multiplied them. And it is He who has sent us down to the home of Paradise out of His bounty. Therein we shall not be touched by fatigue or exhaustion. Gardens of perpetual residence for those to whom God has given His Book.

Therein we shall not be touched by fatigue or exhaustion.”"
m-0861	And those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger will have the fire of Hell kindled. Death will not be decreed for them so that they may die and find rest, nor will its punishment be lightened for them. And such is the recompense with which Allah will reward everyone who persists in disbelief and persists in it. These disbelievers will cry out in the intensity of the torment in the fire of Hell, crying out, “Our Lord, take us out of the fire of Hell and return us to this world so that we may do righteousness other than what we used to do in our worldly life.” So we will believe instead of disbelief. He will say to them, “Did We not grant you respite in this life for a sufficient period of time so that he who would take heed might learn a lesson?” And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) came to you, and yet you did not remember and were not taught a lesson? So taste the punishment of Hell. For there is no helper for the disbelievers to help them against the punishment of Allah. Indeed, Allah is aware of everything that is hidden in the heavens and the earth, and He is Knowing of the secrets of the hearts, so fear Him, lest He see you while you harbor doubt or polytheism in His Oneness or in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), or that you disobey Him in anything less than that.
m-0862	"Allah is the One Who has made you, O mankind, succeed one another on earth. So whoever among you denies the Oneness of Allah, then upon himself is his own harm and disbelief. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers in the sight of their Lord except in hatred and anger, and their disbelief in Allah does not increase them except in error and destruction. Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists, ""Inform me of what your partners have created on the earth. Or do your partners whom you worship besides Allah have a partner with Allah in the creation of the heavens? Or have We given them a book so that they are upon an argument from it?"" Rather, the disbelievers promise one another nothing but delusion and deception. Indeed, Allah holds the heavens and the earth lest they move from their place. And if the heavens and the earth should move from their place, no one can hold them after Him. Indeed, Allah is Forbearing in delaying the punishment for the disbelievers and the disobedient, Forgiving to whoever repents from his sin and returns to Him."
m-0863	"The infidels of Quraysh swore by God with the strongest oaths that if a messenger came to them from God, frightening them with God’s punishment, they would be more upright and more adherent to the truth than the Jews, Christians and others. But when Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, came to them, it only increased their distance from the truth and their aversion to it. Their oaths were not for good intentions or seeking the truth, but rather it was arrogance on earth towards people, intending evil plotting, deception and falsehood, and evil plotting does not encompass except its people. So do the arrogant and cunning await anything but the punishment that befell their likes who preceded them? You will not find any change or transformation in the way of God, for no one is able to change or divert the punishment from himself or others. Did not the infidels of Mecca travel through the land and see what was the end of those before them, such as ‘Aad and Thamud and their likes, and what befell them of destruction and devastation when they denied the messengers? And those infidels were stronger in strength and power than the infidels of Mecca, and God Almighty could not be unable or evade anything in the heavens or on the earth. Indeed, He is Knowing of their actions and Able to do so. Their destruction
And if God were to punish people for what they have done of sins and transgressions, He would not leave on the face of the earth a single creature to crawl upon it, but He gives them respite and delays their punishment until a time known to Him. So when the time of their punishment comes, then indeed God is ever, over His servants, Seeing. Nothing of them is hidden from Him, and nothing of their affairs escapes His knowledge. And He will reward them for what they have done of good or evil."
m-0864	"Yes, we have previously discussed the separate letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah.

We have sent it down to you, O Messenger, so that you may warn thereby a people whose fathers were not warned before you, and they are the Arabs. These people are heedless of faith and righteousness in righteous deeds, and every nation that is cut off from warning falls into heedlessness. This is evidence of the obligation of calling and reminding scholars of Allah and His law to awaken Muslims from their heedlessness.

It has been obligatory The punishment is upon most of these disbelievers after the truth was presented to them and they rejected it, for they do not believe in Allah or His Messenger, nor do they act according to His law.

Indeed, We made these disbelievers who were presented with the truth and rejected it and persisted in disbelief and lack of faith like those who put shackles on their necks, so their hands were tied with their necks under their chins, so they were forced to raise their heads to the sky, so they are chained from every good thing, they do not see the truth nor are they guided to it.

And We placed a barrier in front of the disbelievers and a barrier behind them, so they are like someone whose path is blocked from before him and behind him, so We blinded their sight because of their disbelief and arrogance, so they do not see the right path nor are they guided. And everyone who meets the call to Islam with aversion and stubbornness is deserving of this punishment.
The warning you, O Messenger, are the same to these stubborn disbelievers, for they do not believe and do not act. Your warning is only beneficial to those who believe in the Qur’an and follow what is in it of Allah’s rulings and fear the Most Merciful where no one can see him except Allah, so give him good tidings of forgiveness from Allah for his sins and a reward from Him. In the Hereafter, for his good deeds, which is his entry into Paradise. We will bring all the dead to life by resurrecting them on the Day of Resurrection, and we will record what they did of good and evil, and the effects they had caused in their lives and after their deaths, of good, such as a righteous son, beneficial knowledge, and ongoing charity, and of evil, such as polytheism and disobedience. We have recorded everything in a clear book, which is the Mother of Books, and to it is their return, which is the Preserved Tablet. So the wise person must hold himself accountable to be a role model in goodness in his life and after his death."
m-0865	"And, O Messenger, set forth for the polytheists of your people who reject your call an example by which they may take heed. It is the story of the people of the town when the messengers went to them. We sent to them two messengers to call them to believe in Allah and to abandon the worship of other than Him. The people of the town denied the two messengers, so We strengthened them and reinforced them with a third messenger. The three said to the people of the town, “Indeed, we are messengers to you, O people.” The people of the town said to the messengers, “You are only people like us, and the Most Merciful has not sent down anything of revelation. You, O messengers, are only liars.” The messengers said, “Our Lord, who has sent us, knows that we are messengers to you. And our duty is only to convey the message clearly, and we do not possess your guidance. Guidance is in the hand of Allah alone.” The messengers said, “Our Lord, who has sent us, knows that we are messengers to you. And our duty is only to convey the message clearly, and we do not possess your guidance. Guidance is in the hand of Allah alone.” He knows that we are messengers to you, and we have no duty except to convey the message clearly, and we do not possess your guidance, for guidance is in the hand of Allah alone. The people of the town said, ""Indeed, we consider you a bad omen. If you do not desist from your call to us, we will surely kill you by stoning you, and a painful and painful punishment will surely befall you from us."" The messengers said, ""Your bad omen and your deeds of polytheism and evil are with you and will be returned to you. If you are advised with what is good for you, you will consider us a bad omen and threaten us with stoning and torture. Rather, you are a people whose habit is to go to extremes in disobedience and denial."""
m-0866	"A man came from a far place in the city, hurrying, when he learned that the people of the village intended to kill or torture the messengers. He said, ""O my people, follow the messengers sent to you from Allah. Follow those who do not ask money from you for conveying the message, and they are guided in what they call you to of worshipping Allah alone."" This is a statement of the virtue of those who strive to enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. What is preventing me from worshipping Allah, who created me and to whom you will all return? Should I worship other gods besides Allah, who have no control over the matter? If the Most Gracious intends me evil, these gods have no power to prevent or prevent that, and they cannot save me from what I am in. If I do that, I am in a clear and obvious error. I have believed in your Lord, so listen to what I said it to you, and obey me with faith. When he said that, his people rose up against him and killed him, so Allah admitted him to Paradise.

Shall I worship other gods besides Allah who have no control over anything in the matter? If the Most Gracious intends me evil, these gods cannot prevent or avert that, nor can they save me from what I am in? If I did that, I would be in a clear and obvious error. I have believed in your Lord, so listen to what I have said to you, and obey me with faith. When he said that, his people rose up against him and killed him, so Allah admitted him to Paradise.

It was said to him after he was killed, “Enter Paradise,” as an honor to him.

He said, while he was in bliss and honor, “If only my people knew that my Lord has forgiven me and honored me because of my faith in Allah.” And my patience in obeying Him and following His messengers until I was killed, so that they would believe in God and enter Paradise like me."
m-0867	And it did not require sending down soldiers from the sky to punish them after they killed the man who advised them and denied their messengers, for they are weaker and more insignificant than that. And We would not send down angels upon nations when We destroyed them, but We would send upon them a punishment that would destroy them. Their destruction would not be except with a single shout, and at once they were dead, and not a remnant of them remained. Oh, the regret and remorse of the servants on the Day of Resurrection when they witness the punishment. No messenger from Allah the Most High comes to them except that they mock and ridicule him. Have these mockers not seen and taken heed from those before them from the generations that We destroyed that they will not return to this world? And all these generations that We destroyed and others will all be brought before Us on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning and recompense.
m-0868	"And as a sign to these polytheists of Allah's ability to resurrect and revive, this dead land in which there is no vegetation, We revived it by sending down water and brought forth from it all kinds of plants that people and livestock eat. And whoever revives the land with plants revives creation after death. And We made in this land gardens of palm trees and grapes, and We caused springs of water to gush forth in it to water it. All of that is so that the servants may eat of its fruit. And that is only from the mercy of Allah towards them, not by their effort or their toil or by their power or their strength. So will they not thank Allah for what He has bestowed upon them of these countless blessings? Exalted is Allah, the Almighty, who created all kinds of plants on earth and from themselves, males and females, and from what they do not know of other creatures of Allah. He is unique in creation, so no one should be associated with Him. And a sign for them indicating the oneness of Allah and the perfection of His power is this night from which We remove the day, and suddenly the people are in darkness. And a sign for them is the sun running to a fixed place, which Allah has determined for it. It does not exceed it or fall short of it. That is the determination of the Almighty, who cannot be overcome, the Knowing, who is never absent. About His knowledge something

And the moon is a sign in His creation. We have determined for it phases. Every night it begins as a tiny crescent until it completes as a round moon, then it returns tiny like the curved palm frond in thinness and curvature and yellowness due to its age and dryness

For each of the sun and moon, and the night and day, there is a time that Allah has determined for it and it does not exceed it. The sun cannot catch up with the moon and erase its light or change its course, and the night cannot precede the day and enter it before its time has passed. Each of the sun, moon and planets runs in an orbit

And a proof for them and an evidence that Allah alone is worthy of worship and the bestower of blessings is that We carried those who were saved from the children of Adam in Noah’s ark filled with various kinds of creatures to continue life after the flood

And We created for these polytheists and others like Noah’s ark from ships and other vessels that they ride and that take them to their homelands

And if We will, We can drown them, but they will not find any helper for them from their drowning, nor will they be saved from the drowning

Unless We have mercy on them and save them and grant them enjoyment for a term that perhaps they will return and make up for what they neglected
And when it is said to the polytheists, ""Beware of the Hereafter and its terrors and the conditions of this world and its punishment, hoping for the mercy of Allah upon you,"" they turn away and do not respond to that. And there does not come to these polytheists a clear sign from their Lord to guide them to the truth and make clear to them the truth of the Messenger except that they turn away from it and do not benefit from it. And when it is said to the disbelievers, ""Spend from the provision with which Allah has bestowed upon you,"" they say to the believers, arguing, ""Should we feed someone whom Allah, if He had willed, could have fed?"" You, O believers, are not except in a clear distance from the truth when you order us to do that."
m-0869	"And these infidels say, in a manner of denial and haste, ""When will the Resurrection be if you are truthful in what you say about it?""

What these polytheists who hasten Allah's threat to them are waiting for is only the terrifying blast at the coming of the Hour, which will suddenly seize them while they are disputing about their life affairs.

These polytheists will not be able to advise anyone about anything when the trumpet is blown, nor will they be able to return to their families, but will die in their markets and places.

And the second blast will be blown, and their souls will return to their bodies, and behold, they will be from their graves, rushing to their Lord.

The deniers of the Resurrection will say, regretfully, ""Oh, our destruction! Who brought us out from our graves?"" They will be answered and it will be said to them, ""This is what the Most Merciful promised and the truthful messengers informed us about.""

The Resurrection from the graves is only the result of a single blast in the trumpet, and behold, all of creation will be before Us for reckoning and recompense.

On that Day, the reckoning will be done with justice, and no soul will be wronged in the least by a decrease in its good deeds or an increase in its bad deeds, and you will be recompensed only for what you used to do in this world."
m-0870	The people of Paradise on that day will be busy with all kinds of pleasures that they enjoy. They and their spouses will enjoy sitting on decorated couches under the lush shade. They will have all kinds of delicious fruits in Paradise and all kinds of pleasures that they ask for. They will have another greater pleasure when their Lord, the Most Merciful, will speak to them with peace. At that time, they will have complete safety in all aspects.
m-0871	"And it will be said to the disbelievers on that Day: Distinguish from the believers and separate from them.

And Allah will say to them as a rebuke and a reminder: Did I not command you through the tongues of My messengers that you should not worship Satan and not obey him? Indeed, he is to you an enemy manifest in enmity.

And I commanded you to worship Me alone. So worshipping Me and obeying Me and disobeying Satan is the straight religion that leads to My pleasure and My Paradise.

And Satan has led many of you astray from the truth. Did you not have a mind, O polytheists, to forbid you from following him?

This is Hell, which you were promised in this world because of your disbelief in Allah and your denial of His messengers.

Enter it today and endure its heat because of your disbelief.

Today We will seal the mouths of the polytheists so that they will not speak, and their hands will speak to Us about what they struck, and their feet will bear witness to what they strove for in this world and what they earned of sins.

And if We willed, We could have obliterated their eyes by taking away their sight just as We sealed their mouths. So they hastened to the path to cross it. How can that be achieved for them when it has been obliterated? Their sight

And if We willed, We could have changed their creation and made them sit in their places so that they could neither go forward nor go back

And whoever We extend his life until he becomes old, We return him to the state from which he began, a state of weakness of mind and weakness of body. Do they not understand that He who did such a thing to them is able to resurrect them?"
m-0872	And we have not taught our Messenger Muhammad poetry, nor is it befitting for him to be a poet. What he has brought is nothing but a reminder by which those of understanding may remember. And a Qur’an, clearly indicating the truth from falsehood, its rulings, wisdom, and exhortations, to warn whoever is alive in heart and enlightened in insight, and to justify the punishment for those who disbelieve in God, because God’s conclusive proof has been established against them through the Qur’an.

m-0873	Has not the creation seen that We have created for them grazing livestock which We have subjected to them, so they control their affair? And We have subjected them to them, so some of them they ride on journeys and carry heavy loads on, and some of them they eat. And they have other benefits from them that they benefit from, such as benefiting from their wool, fur, and hair as furniture and clothing, and other things, and they drink their milk. Will they not then thank Allah, who has bestowed these blessings upon them, and devote their worship to Him? And the polytheists have taken besides Allah deities whom they worship, hoping that they will support them and save them from the punishment of Allah. Those deities cannot support their worshippers, nor can they support themselves. And the polytheists and their deities will all be present in the punishment, disavowing one another. So do not grieve, O Messenger, over their disbelief in Allah, their denial of you, and their mockery of you. Indeed, We know what they conceal and what they reveal, and We will reward them for that.
m-0874	Has not man who denies the Resurrection seen the beginning of his creation and used it as evidence for his return? We created him from a sperm-drop that passed through stages until he grew, and at once he became much quarrelsome and clear in argument. The one who denies the Resurrection has given us an example that should not be given, which is comparing the power of the Creator with the power of the created, and he forgot the beginning of his creation. He said, “Who will give life to the decayed, crumbling bones?” Say to him, “He will give life to them who created them the first time. And He is Knowing of all His creation. Nothing is hidden from Him. He who has brought forth for you from the green, moist tree a burning fire, and at once you kindle fire from the tree. He is Able to bring forth the opposite from the opposite. This is evidence of the Oneness of God and the perfection of His power. Among this is bringing forth the dead from their graves alive. Is not He who created the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them able to create the like of them and restore them as He began them? Yes, He is Able to do that. He is the Creator of all creatures, the Knower of all that He has created and will create. Nothing is hidden from Him. His command, glory be to Him, when He intends a thing, is only to say to it, “Be,” and it is. Among these are death, life, resurrection, and revival. So God is exalted. He is sanctified from weakness and polytheism, for He is the Owner of everything, the Disposer of the affairs of His creation without dispute or impediment. The evidence of His power and the perfection of His grace has become apparent, and to Him you will return for reckoning and reward.
m-0875	Allah the Almighty swears by the angels who stand in close rows in their worship, and by the angels who drive the clouds and lead them by Allah’s command, and by the angels who recite the remembrance of Allah and His words: “Your deity, O people, is One, with no partner, so be sincere in your worship and obedience to Him.” Allah swears by whatever He wills of His creation. As for the created, it is not permissible for him to swear except by Allah, so swearing by other than Allah is polytheism.

As for the created, it is not permissible for him to swear except by Allah, so swearing by other than Allah is polytheism.

As for the created, it is not permissible for him to swear except by Allah, so swearing by other than Allah is polytheism. He is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and everything between them, and the Controller of the sun in its risings and settings. Indeed, We have adorned the lowest heaven with an adornment, which is the stars. And We have protected the heaven with the stars from every rebellious, defiant, outcast devil. The devils cannot reach the highest assembly, which is the heavens and the angels in them, so they listen to them when they speak what Allah the Almighty inspires of His law and decree, and they are pelted with meteors from every direction to drive them away from listening, and they will have a permanent, painful torment in the Hereafter. The devils cannot reach the highest assembly, which is the heavens and the angels in them. From the angels, you listen to them when they speak what God Almighty inspires of His law and decree, and they are pelted with meteors from every direction to drive them away from listening, and for them in the Hereafter is a permanent and painful punishment. Except for those who are snatched by the devils, which is a word that they hear from the sky quickly, so they throw it to the one below him, and the other throws it to the one below him, and perhaps the shining meteor will catch up with him before he throws it, and perhaps he throws it by the decree of God Almighty before the meteor comes to him and burns him, so the other takes it to the priests, and they tell a hundred lies with it.
m-0876	"So ask, O Messenger, those who deny the Resurrection, are they more severe in creation or those We created from these creatures? Indeed, We created their father Adam from sticky clay, parts of which cling to each other.

Rather, O Messenger, I am amazed at their denial and rejection of the Resurrection. What is more amazing than their denial and more eloquent is that they mock you and ridicule your words.

And when they are reminded of something they have forgotten or neglected, they do not benefit from this reminder nor do they reflect.

And when they see a miracle indicating your prophethood, they mock it and are amazed.

And they say, ""What is this that you have brought but apparent magic? When we die and become dust and decayed bones, will we indeed be raised from our graves alive or will our fathers who have passed away before us be raised?""

And they say, ""What is this that you have brought but apparent magic? When we die and become dust and decayed bones, will we indeed be raised from our graves alive or will our fathers who have passed away before us be raised?""

And they say, ""What is this that you have brought but apparent magic?"" And rotten bones. Shall we indeed be resurrected from our graves alive, or shall our fathers who passed away before us be resurrected? Say to them, O Messenger, “Yes, you will be resurrected, and you will be humiliated and debased.” Then it will be but a single blast. Then they will rise from their graves, looking at the terrors of the Day of Resurrection. And they will say, “Oh, our destruction! This is the Day of Reckoning and Recompense.” Then it will be said to them, “This is the Day of Judgment between creation with justice, which you used to deny in this world and reject.”"
m-0877	"And it will be said to the angels, ""Gather together those who disbelieved in Allah and their counterparts and their gods whom they used to worship besides Allah, and drive them violently to Hell."" And it will be said to the angels, ""Gather together those who disbelieved in Allah and their counterparts and their gods whom they used to worship besides Allah, and drive them violently to Hell."" And detain them before they reach Hell. They will be held accountable for their actions and words that they uttered in this world, questioning them, denouncing them, and rebuking them. And it will be said to them, as a rebuke, ""What is the matter with you that you do not support one another?"" Rather, today they are obedient to the command of Allah, neither disobeying it nor deviating from it, not defending themselves. And some of the disbelievers will turn to one another, blaming and quarreling. The followers will say to the ones being led, ""You used to come to us from the side of religion and truth, but you made light of the matter of the Shariah for us, and you turned us away from it, and you made misguidance seem attractive to us."" The ones being led will say to the ones being led, ""The matter is not as you claim. Rather, your hearts were denying faith and were prone to disbelief and disobedience."" And we had no We have no proof or strength against you to turn you away from faith. Rather, you, O polytheists, were a transgressing people, exceeding the limits of truth.

So we are all bound by the threat of our Lord: “We will surely taste the punishment, we and you, for what we have done of our sins and transgressions in this world.”

So we led you astray from the path of Allah and from faith in Him. Indeed, we were astray before you, so we were destroyed because of our disbelief, and we destroyed you with us.

For the followers and the followed will share in the punishment on the Day of Resurrection, just as they shared in the world in disobeying Allah.

This is how we will deal with those who chose disobeying Allah in this world over obeying Him. So we will make them taste the painful punishment.

Indeed, those polytheists were in this world, when it was said to them, “There is no god but Allah,” and they were called to it and ordered to abandon what contradicts it, they were arrogant about it and about the one who brought it.

And they said, “Should we abandon the worship of our gods because of the words of a mad poet,” meaning the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

They denied Muhammad, as they described him. Rather, he came with the Qur’an and monotheism, and he spoke the truth about the Messengers in what they reported about him of the law of Allah and His monotheism.

Indeed, O polytheists, with your words, disbelief, and denial, you will taste the painful and grievous punishment. And you will not be recompensed in the Hereafter except for what you used to do in this world of sins."
m-0878	"Except for the servants of Allah, the Most High, who were sincere to Him in their worship, so He made them sincere and singled them out for His mercy, for they are saved from the painful torment.

Those who are sincere will have a known provision in Paradise that will not be cut off.

That provision will be various fruits, and they will be honored by Allah’s honor for them in the Gardens of Eternal Bliss.

That provision will be various fruits, and they will be honored by Allah’s honor for them in the Gardens of Eternal Bliss.

And from their honor with their Lord and the honor of one another is that they will be on thrones facing each other.

They will be served in their gatherings with cups of wine from flowing rivers, they will not fear their interruption, white in color, delicious to drink, and there will be no harm to the body or the mind.

And in their gatherings there are chaste women who do not look at anyone but their husbands. Beautiful eyes like white eggs that have not been touched by hands."
m-0879	Then some of them turned to one another, asking about their conditions in this world, what they suffered in it, and what Allah bestowed upon them in Paradise. This is from the perfection of intimacy. A speaker from the people of Paradise said, “I had a companion in this world who was always with me.” He said, “How do you believe in the resurrection, which is extremely strange? If we die and are torn apart and become dust and bones, will we be resurrected and held accountable and rewarded for our deeds?” He said, “How do you believe in the resurrection, which is extremely strange? If we die and are torn apart and become dust and bones, will we be resurrected and held accountable and rewarded for our deeds?” This believer who was admitted to Paradise said to his companions, “Are you aware so that we may see the fate of that companion?” So he looked and saw his companion in the middle of the Fire. The believer said to his companion who denied the resurrection, “You came close to destroying me by turning me away from faith. If I had obeyed you, and were it not for the grace of my Lord in guiding me to faith and making me steadfast in it, I would have been among those brought to the punishment with you.” The believer said to his denier companion, For the Resurrection You have almost destroyed me by turning me away from faith. Had I obeyed you, and had it not been for the grace of my Lord in guiding me to faith and making me steadfast in it, I would have been among those brought to the torment with you. Are we truly eternally blessed? We will not die except for our first death in this world, and we will not be punished after entering Paradise? Indeed, what we are in of bliss is indeed the great triumph? Are we truly eternally blessed? We will not die except for our first death in this world, and we will not be punished after entering Paradise? Indeed, what we are in of bliss is indeed the great triumph? Are we truly eternally blessed? We will not die except for our first death in this world, and we will not be punished after entering Paradise? Indeed, what we are in of bliss is indeed the great triumph? For such complete bliss, everlasting eternity, and great victory, let those who work in this world work so that they may attain it in the Hereafter.
m-0880	"Is that which was previously described of the delights of Paradise the best hospitality and gift from Allah, or the cursed, evil tree of Zaqqum, the food of the people of the Fire?

Indeed, We have made it a trial by which the wrongdoers tempted themselves with disbelief and sins. And they said, in disapproval, ""Indeed, your companion informs you that there is a tree in the Fire, and the Fire consumes trees.""

It is a tree that grows in the depths of Hell. Its fruit is ugly in appearance, as if it were the heads of devils. If that is the case, then do not ask after this about its taste, for the polytheists will eat from that tree and fill their bellies with it. Then, after eating from it, they will drink a hot, ugly, mixed drink. Then, after this torment, their return will be to the torment of the Fire. ...

And most of the previous nations had gone astray from the truth before your people, O Messenger

And We had sent among those nations messengers who warned them of the punishment, but they disbelieved

So consider how was the end of those nations that were warned and disbelieved, for they were punished and became a lesson for the people

m-0881	"And Our Prophet Noah called upon Us to help him against his people, and excellent were We to respond to him.

And We saved him and his family and the believers with him from the harm of the polytheists and from drowning in the great flood.

And We made the descendants of Noah the survivors after the drowning of his people.

And We left for him a beautiful memory and good praise among those who came after him of the people, so that they would remember him by it.

Safety for Noah and safety for him from being mentioned badly in others, but rather the generations after him would praise him.

Like the reward of Noah, We reward everyone who did well among the servants in obeying Allah.

Indeed, Noah was among Our servants, the believers, the sincere, the doers of Allah’s commands.

Then We drowned the others who denied among his people in the flood, so that not an eye remained of them that blinked."

So Abraham looked at the stars, thinking about what he would apologize for not going out with them to their festivals, and he said to them, ""I am sick,"" and this was an insinuation from him, so they left him behind them.

So he quickly turned to the idols of his people and said, mocking them, ""Do you not eat this food that your guardians offer you? What is the matter with you that you do not speak or answer those who ask you?""

So he turned to their gods, striking and breaking them with his right hand to prove to his people that they were wrong in their worship of them.

So Abraham's people intended to plot against him to destroy him, but We made them the vanquished and the defeated. And God turned their plot back upon them and made the fire cool and safe for Abraham."
m-0883	"And Abraham said, ""Indeed, I am emigrating to my Lord from the land of my people to where I can worship my Lord. Indeed, He will guide me to what is good for my religion and my world. My Lord, give me a righteous son."" So We answered his prayer and gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy, that is, he would be forbearing in his old age, and he was Ishmael. When Ishmael grew up and walked with his father, his father said to him, ""Indeed, I have seen in a dream that I am sacrificing you, so what do you think? The vision of the prophets is true."" Ishmael said, pleasing his Lord, dutiful to his father, and helping him in obeying God. ""Carry out what God has commanded you to do in sacrificing me. You will find me, God willing, patient, obedient, and seeking reward."" So when they had submitted to God's command and obeyed Him, and Abraham threw his son on his forehead, the side of his forehead, on the ground to slaughter him, We called to Abraham in that difficult situation, ""O Abraham, you have done what you were commanded and have fulfilled your vision. Indeed, We have As We rewarded you for your belief, We reward those who do good like you, and We deliver them from hardships in this world and the Hereafter.

And We called to Abraham in that difficult situation, “O Abraham, you have done what you were commanded to do and have fulfilled your vision. Indeed, as We rewarded you for your belief, We will reward those who do good like you, and We will deliver them from hardships in this world and the Hereafter.”

The command to slaughter your son is the difficult test that demonstrated the truth of your faith.

And We rescued Ishmael, and We replaced him with a great ram.

And We left for Abraham a good reputation among the nations after him.

A greeting to Abraham from God and a prayer for his safety from every affliction.

As We rewarded Abraham for his obedience to Us and his compliance with Our command, We reward the doers of good among Our servants.

He is one of Our believing servants who gave servitude its due.

And We gave Abraham good tidings of his son Isaac, a prophet among the righteous, as a reward for his patience and his contentment with the command of his Lord and his obedience to Him.

And We sent down upon them blessings, and among their descendants are those who are obedient to their Lord, do good to themselves, and He is clearly unjust to her through his disbelief and disobedience."

m-0887	"And Our servant Yunus, We chose him and made him one of the messengers, when he fled from his country in anger at his people and boarded a ship filled with passengers and goods. And great waves surrounded it, so the passengers of the ship drew lots to lighten the load for fear of drowning, so Yunus was among the defeated. So he was thrown into the sea and the whale swallowed him. And Yunus, peace be upon him, did what he was blamed for. Had it not been for the abundance of his worship and righteous deeds before he fell into the belly of the whale, and his glorification while in the belly of the whale, saying, “There is no god but You, glory be to You, indeed I was among the wrongdoers,” he would have remained in the belly of the whale and it would have become a grave for him until the Day of Resurrection.

So We cast him out of the belly of the whale and threw him into a barren land, devoid of trees and buildings, and he was weak in body.

And We caused a gourd tree to grow over him to shade him and benefit him.

And We sent him to a hundred thousand of his people, or rather more. So they believed and acted according to what he brought, so We gave them enjoyment of their lives until the time of their appointed times.

m-0888	"So ask, O Messenger, your people how they have made for Allah daughters whom they hate and for themselves sons whom they desire.

And ask them, ""Did We create the angels females while they were present?""

And among their lies is their saying, ""Allah has a son."" And indeed, they are liars, because they say what they do not know.

And among their lies is their saying, ""Allah has a son."" And indeed, they are liars, because they say what they do not know.

Why does Allah choose daughters over sons?

Evil is the judgment you make, O people, that Allah should have daughters and you should have sons, while you do not desire daughters for yourselves.

Do you not remember that it is not permissible and it is not appropriate for Him to have a son? Exalted is Allah far above that.

Rather, do you have a clear proof for your statement and fabrication?

If you have a proof in a Book from Allah, then produce it, if you are truthful in your statement."
m-0889	"The polytheists have made a kinship and relationship between Allah and the angels.

m-0892	"... What he calls for in the religion of our fathers from Quraysh and in Christianity, this is nothing but a lie and slander.

We have not heard of what he calls for in the religion of our fathers from Quraysh and in Christianity. This is nothing but a lie and slander.
Muhammad was singled out for the revelation of the Qur’an without us. Rather, they are in doubt about my revelation to you, O Messenger, and my sending you. Rather, they said that because they have not tasted the punishment of Allah. If they had tasted His punishment, they would not have dared to say what they said.

Or do they possess the treasures of the bounty of your Lord, the Almighty, in His dominion, the Giver of whatever He wills of His provision and bounty to whomever He wills of His creation?

Or do these polytheists have the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, so that they may give and withhold? So let them take the means that lead them to heaven until they rule as they wish of giving and withholding.

These lying soldiers are a defeated army, just as other parties before them were defeated. People before them lied. Noah, Aad, Pharaoh, the mighty man, Thamud, the people of Lot, the people of the trees and gardens, who were the people of Shuaib.

m-0894	"Be patient, O Messenger, over what they say of what you dislike, and remember Our servant David, the possessor of strength over the enemies of Allah and patience in obeying Him. He is the Forgiving, the One who often returns to what pleases Allah. In this is a consolation for the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.

Indeed, We subjected the mountains with David, glorifying with his glorification at the beginning of the day and at its end. And We subjected the birds with him, in groups, glorifying and obeying following him.

They said to him, ""Fear not, for we are two disputants, one of whom has wronged the other, so judge between us with justice and do not be unfair to us in judgment, and guide us to the right path."" One of them said, ""This is my brother, and he has ninety-nine ewes, and I have only one ewe. He coveted it and said, ""Give it to me,"" and he defeated me with his argument. David said, ""Your brother has wronged you by asking to add your ewe to his ewes. And indeed, many partners transgress against one another and wrong one another by taking his right and not giving him justice from himself, except for the righteous believers. So let not some of them transgress against others, and they are few."" And David was certain that We had tested him with this dispute, so he sought forgiveness from his Lord and prostrated, seeking nearness to Allah, and returned to Him and repented. So We forgave him that and made him a disbeliever. Of those brought near to Us, and We have prepared for him a good destination in the Hereafter. O David, indeed We have made you a successor upon the earth and given you dominion over it, so judge between the people with justice and fairness, and do not follow desire in rulings, lest that leads you astray from the religion of Allah and His law. Indeed, those who go astray from the way of Allah will have a painful punishment in the Fire, because of their heedlessness of the Day of Judgment and Reckoning. In this is a recommendation to those in authority to judge with the truth revealed by Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, and not to deviate from it, lest they go astray from His way."

So woe to them from the Fire on the Day of Resurrection for their false assumption and their disbelief in Allah. Shall We treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like the corrupters on earth, or shall We treat the people of piety and the believers like the people of wickedness and the disbelievers? This comparison is not befitting of the wisdom and judgment of Allah. They are not equal before Allah. Rather, Allah rewards the believing, pious ones and punishes the corrupt, wretched ones. This is what has been revealed to you, O Messenger, a blessed Book that We have revealed to you so that they may reflect on its verses and act according to its guidance and indications, and so that those with sound minds may remember what Allah has charged them with.
m-0897	"And We gave to David his son Solomon, and We bestowed favor upon him and made him content with his eyes. What an excellent servant Solomon was! He often returned to Allah and turned to Him in repentance. 

Remember when the swift purebred horses were shown to him in the afternoon, standing on three legs and raising the fourth because of its nobility and lightness, and they continued to be shown to him until the sun set. 

He said, ""Indeed, I have preferred the love of wealth over the remembrance of my Lord."" Until the sun set from his eyes, they were returned to me the horses that were shown before, and he began to stroke their legs and necks. 

And We certainly tried Solomon and placed on his throne a half-child of his when he swore that they would go around to his wives, and each of them would bring forth a knight who would fight in the cause of Allah, and he did not say, ""If Allah wills."" So he went around to them all, and none of them conceived except one woman who brought forth a half-child. Then Solomon returned to his Lord and repented. He said, ""My Lord, forgive me my sin and grant me a kingdom great and special, such as will not be like it to any of mankind after me. Indeed, You are the Forgiving, the Merciful."" Glory be to You, the Generous and the Bestower. So We responded to him and subdued the wind, blowing by his command, obedient, with its strength and intensity, wherever He willed. And We certainly tested Solomon and placed on his throne a half-sister's son, a son of his, when he swore that they would go around to his wives, and each of them would bring forth a knight fighting in the cause of Allah. And he did not say, ""God willing."" So he went around to them all, and none of them became pregnant except one woman who gave birth to a half-sister. Then Solomon returned to his Lord and repented. He said, ""My Lord, forgive me my sin and grant me a special kingdom such as will not be like it to any of mankind after me."" Indeed, You, glory be to You, are the Generous and the Bestower.

Indeed, You are, glory be to You, abundant in generosity and giving. So We responded to him and subjected the wind to flow by his command, obedient, with its strength and intensity, wherever He willed. And We subjected to him the devils that he might use them in his works. Among them were the builders and the divers in the seas, and others, who are rebellious devils, bound in chains. This great kingdom and special subjugation is Our gift to you, O Solomon, so give to whomever you wish and withhold from whomever you wish, no account will be taken of you. And indeed, Solomon is with Us in the Hereafter. For proximity and good reference"
m-0898	And remember, O Messenger, Our servant Job when he called upon his Lord, saying, “Satan has caused me fatigue, hardship, and pain in my body, my wealth, and my family.” So We said to him, “Strike the ground with your foot; there will spring forth for you from it cool water. Drink from it and wash yourself, and the harm and injury will go away from you.” So We removed his harm from him and honored him and gave him his family of wife and children and increased him likewise in sons and grandchildren. All of that is mercy from Us to him and honoring him for his patience and a lesson and reminder for those with sound minds so that they may know that the consequence of patience is relief and the removal of harm. And We said to him, “Take in your hand a bundle of incense sticks and strike your wife with them, fulfilling your oath, so do not break your oath when he swore that he would strike her a hundred lashes if Allah healed him,” when he was angry with her for a minor matter during his illness. She was a righteous woman, so Allah had mercy on her and on him with this fatwa. Indeed, We found Job patient in the face of affliction. What an excellent servant he was, for he returned to the obedience of Allah.
m-0899	"And remember, O Messenger, Our servants and prophets, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for they were men of strength in obeying God and of insight in His religion.

Indeed, We singled them out with a great distinction, for We placed the remembrance of the Hereafter in their hearts, so they worked for it through obedience to Us, and called people to it and reminded them of it. And indeed, they are, with Us, among those whom We chose for Our obedience and selected for Our message.

And remember, O Messenger, Our servants, Ishmael, Elisha, and Dhul-Kifl, with the best remembrance. Indeed, each of them is among the best whom Allah chose from among creation and chose for them the most perfect conditions and attributes."

What an evil abode is that of stability.” Hell

The group of followers said, ""Our Lord, whoever misguides us in this world from guidance, double his punishment in the Fire.""

I have no knowledge of the dispute between the angels of heaven regarding the creation of Adam, had it not been for Allah's teaching me and inspiring me.

Remind them, O Messenger, when your Lord said to the angels, ""I am going to create a human being from clay. So when I have proportioned his body and created him and breathed into him the soul and life began to flow into him, then prostrate to him in prostration of greeting."" And honor, not prostration, but worship and glorification, for worship is only for God alone. God has forbidden in the Islamic law prostration for greeting.

When I have proportioned his body and created him and breathed into him the soul, then life will flow into him, then prostrate to him in prostration of greeting and honor, not prostration of worship and glorification, for worship is only for God alone.” God has forbidden in the Islamic law prostration for greeting. So all the angels prostrated together in obedience and compliance, except for Iblis, for he did not prostrate out of arrogance and pride, and he was among the disbelievers in the knowledge of God Almighty. God said to Iblis, “What prevented you from prostrating to the one I honored and created with My hands? Were you arrogant toward Adam, or were you among the arrogant toward your Lord?” And in the verse, the attribute of hands is proven for God Almighty in the manner befitting Him, glory be to Him. Iblis said Opposing his Lord, I did not prostrate to him because I am better than him since You created me from fire and created him from clay, and fire is better than clay.

Allah said to him, “Get out of Paradise, for you are stoned by word, rejected, and cursed. You must expel and banish me until the Day of Resurrection.”

Allah said to him, “Get out of Paradise, for you are stoned by word, rejected, and cursed. You must expel and banish me until the Day of Resurrection.”

Satan said, “By Your glory, O Lord, and Your greatness, I will surely mislead all the children of Adam, except for those whom You have sincerely devoted to Your worship and protected from my misguidance, for You have not given me a way over them.”

Satan said, “By Your glory, O Lord, and Your greatness, I will surely mislead all the children of Adam, except for those whom You have sincerely devoted to Your worship and protected from my misguidance, for You have not given me a way over them.”

He said, Allah, the truth is from Me, and I say nothing but the truth. I will fill Hell with you and your offspring and those who follow you from among the children of Adam, all together.

Allah said, the truth is from Me, and I say nothing but the truth. I will fill Hell with you and your offspring and those who follow you from among the children of Adam, all together.

Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists among your people, I do not ask you for a reward or recompense for calling you and guiding you, nor do I claim a matter that is not mine. Rather, I follow what is revealed to me, and I do not undertake to make up lies and fabrications.

This Qur’an is only a reminder to the worlds of jinn and mankind, so that they may remember what benefits them in their religious and worldly interests.

And you, O polytheists, will know the news of this Qur’an and its truth when Islam prevails and people enter it in droves, and also when the punishment befalls you and the causes are cut off from you."
m-0903	"The revelation of the Qur’an is only from Allah, the Almighty in His power and vengeance, the Wise in His management and judgments.

Indeed, We have sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an enjoining truth and justice, so worship Allah alone and devote all your religion to Him.

To Allah alone is complete obedience, free from polytheism. And those who associate others with Allah and take protectors besides Him say, “We do not worship these gods along with Allah except that they may intercede for us with Allah and bring us closer to Him in status.” So they disbelieved in that, because worship and intercession are for Allah alone. Indeed, Allah will judge between the sincere believers and those who associate others with Allah on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences in their worship, and He will reward each according to what he deserves. Indeed, Allah does not guide to the straight path anyone who slanders Allah and disbelieves in His signs and proofs.

If Allah had wanted to take a son, He would have chosen from His creation whomever He willed. Allah is far removed and sanctified from having a son, for He is the One, the Unique, the Eternal, the Subduer, who subdued His creation with His power, so everything is submissive and humble to Him.

Allah created the heavens and the earth and what is in them in truth. He brings the night and takes away the day and brings By day and by night He has made the sun and the moon subservient to regularity for the benefit of His servants, each running in its orbit until the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, God, who did these actions and bestowed these blessings upon His creation, is the Almighty over His creation, the Forgiver of the sins of His repentant servants."
m-0904	Your Lord created you, O people, from Adam and created from him his wife and created for you from the livestock eight kinds, male and female, from camels, cows, sheep and goats. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, stage after stage of creation, in the darkness of the belly, the womb and the placenta. That is Allah who created these things, your Lord, the Unique in Kingship, the One in Divinity, the One deserving of worship alone. So how can you turn away from worshipping Him to worshipping other than Him from among His creation? If you disbelieve, O people, in your Lord and do not believe in Him and do not follow His messengers, then He is independent of you and has no need of you, and you are the ones in need of Him. He does not accept disbelief for His servants, nor does He command them to do so. Rather, He is pleased with them to be grateful for His blessings upon them. And no soul bears the sin of another soul. Then to your Lord is your final destination. He will inform you of your deeds and will hold you accountable for them. Indeed, He is Knowing of the secrets of the souls and what the breasts conceal. And when a person is afflicted with a calamity, hardship and illness, he remembers his Lord and seeks help from Him and calls upon Him. Then when He answers him and removes his harm from him and grants him His blessings, he forgets his supplication to his Lord when he is in need of Him and associates others with Him to lead astray. Other than faith in God and obedience to Him, say to him, O Messenger, threateningly, “Enjoy your disbelief for a little while until your death and the end of your term. Indeed, you are among the people of the Fire, abiding eternally therein.”
m-0905	Is this disbeliever who enjoys his disbelief better or one who is a worshipper of his Lord, obedient to Him, who spends the hours of the night standing and prostrating to Allah, fearing the punishment of the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord? Say, O Messenger, are those equal who know their Lord and their true religion and those who know nothing of that? They are not equal. Only those with sound minds remember and know the difference. Say, O Prophet, to My servants who believe in Allah and His Messenger, fear your Lord by obeying Him and avoiding disobeying Him. For those who do good in this world by worshipping their Lord and obeying Him, there is good in the Hereafter, which is Paradise, and good in this world, such as health, provision, victory, and other things. And the earth of Allah is vast, so migrate therein to where you worship your Lord and are able to establish your religion. Only the patient will be given their reward in the Hereafter without limit, count, or amount. This is an exaltation of the reward and recompense of the patient.
m-0906	Say, O Messenger, to the people, God has commanded me and those who follow me to sincerely worship Him alone, without anyone else, and He has commanded me to be the first of my nation to submit to Him, to submit to Him in monotheism, to sincerely worship Him, and to be free from all other gods besides Him. Say, O Messenger, to the people, God has commanded me and those who follow me to sincerely worship Him alone, without anyone else, and He has commanded me to be the first of my nation to submit to Him, to submit to Him in monotheism, to sincerely worship Him, and to be free from all other gods besides Him. Say, O Messenger, to the people, I fear, if I disobey my Lord in what He has commanded me to do of worshipping Him and being sincere in obeying Him, the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, that Day whose terror is great. Say, O Messenger, I worship God alone, with no partner, sincerely worshipping and obeying Him, so you, O polytheists, worship whatever you wish besides God, of idols and statues and other than that of His creation, and that will not harm me at all. This is a threat and warning to those who worship other than God and associate others with Him. Say, O Messenger, the true losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection, and that is because of their being led astray in this world. And their misguidance from the faith. Indeed, the loss of these polytheists themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection is the clear and obvious loss. Say, O Messenger, I worship Allah alone, with no partner, devoting my worship and obedience to Him alone. So worship, O polytheists, whatever you wish besides Allah, of idols and statues and other than that of His creations, for that will not harm me at all. This is a threat and warning to those who worship other than Allah and associate others with Him. Say, O Messenger, indeed, the true losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection, and that is by their being misled in this world and misguided from the faith. Indeed, the loss of these polytheists themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection is the clear and obvious loss. Those are the losers. Above them in Hell are pieces of torment from the Fire, like built-up shadows, and below them likewise. This is the described torment with which Allah frightens His servants so that they may beware of Him. O My servants, fear Me by obeying My commands and avoiding disobedience. And those who avoid obeying Satan and worshipping other than Allah and repent to Allah by worshipping Him and devoting their religion to Him alone, for them is good news in the life of this world. With good praise and success from Allah, and in the Hereafter, the pleasure of Allah and eternal bliss in Paradise. So give good tidings, O Prophet, to My servants who listen to the word and follow the most correct and best speech. The most correct is the word of Allah, then the word of His Messenger. Those are the ones whom Allah has guided to the right path and has guided them to the best morals and deeds. Those are the ones with sound minds. And those who have avoided obeying Satan and worshipping other than Allah, and have repented to Allah by worshipping Him and devoting their religion to Him, for them is good tidings in this worldly life with good praise and success from Allah, and in the Hereafter, the pleasure of Allah and eternal bliss in Paradise. So give good tidings, O Prophet, to My servants who listen to the word and follow the most correct and best speech. The word of Allah, then the word of His Messenger. Those are the ones whom Allah has guided to the right path and has guided them to the best morals and deeds. Those are the ones with sound minds. Is it he upon whom the word of punishment has become obligatory because of his persistence in his error and stubbornness? You have no power, O Messenger, to guide him. Are you able to save those in the Fire? You are not able to do that. But those who fear their Lord by obeying Him and being sincere His worship of them in Paradise is rooms built one above the other, with rivers flowing beneath its trees. God has promised it to His righteous servants, a promise that will be fulfilled. God does not fail in His promise.
m-0907	Have you not seen, O Messenger, that Allah sends down rain from the clouds and causes it to enter the earth and makes it springs gushing forth and running waters? Then He produces with this water crops of varying colors and kinds. Then they dry up after their greenness and freshness, and you see them turning yellow. Then He makes them broken and crumbling debris. Indeed, in the action of Allah is a reminder and an admonition for those of sound minds. Is he whose breast Allah has expanded and who is happy with accepting Islam, submitting to it, and believing in it, so he has insight into his affair and guidance from his Lord, like he who is not like that? They are not equal. So woe and destruction to those whose hearts have hardened and who turn away from the remembrance of Allah. Those are in clear error from the truth. Allah, the Most High, is the One Who has sent down the best statement, which is the Great Qur’an, consistent in its beauty and perfection and lack of difference. There are repeated stories, rulings, arguments, and clear proofs in it. The skins of those who fear their Lord tremble at hearing it, affected by what is in it of terror and threat. Then their skins and hearts soften, rejoicing in what is in it of promise and encouragement. That effect By the Qur’an is guidance from Allah to His servants, and Allah guides by the Qur’an whomever He wills of His servants. And whoever Allah misguides from believing in this Qur’an because of his disbelief and stubbornness, then for him there is no guide to guide him and grant him success. Is he who is thrown into the Fire in chains, and is not able to protect himself from the Fire except with his face because of his disbelief and misguidance, better, or he who enjoys Paradise because Allah has guided him? And it will be said on that Day to the wrongdoers, “Taste the evil of what you used to earn in this world from disobeying Allah.” Those before your people, O Messenger, denied their messengers, so the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive its coming. So Allah made the disbelieving nations taste the punishment and humiliation in this world, and prepared for them a more severe and more severe punishment in the Hereafter. If these polytheists had known that what happened to them was because of their disbelief and denial, they would have been admonished. Those before your people, O Messenger, denied their messengers, so the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive its coming. So Allah made the disbelieving nations taste the punishment and humiliation in this world, and prepared for them a more severe and more severe punishment in the Hereafter. In the Hereafter, if these polytheists knew that what happened to them was because of their disbelief and denial, they would have been admonished.
m-0908	And We have certainly presented to these polytheists in this Qur’an every example from the examples of past generations, as a warning and a reminder, so that they may remember and refrain from what they are doing, which is disbelief in Allah. And We have made this Qur’an in Arabic, clear in wording and easy in meaning, without ambiguity or deviation, so that they may fear Allah by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. And We have certainly presented to these polytheists in this Qur’an every example from the examples of past generations, as a warning and a reminder, so that they may remember and refrain from what they are doing, which is disbelief in Allah. And We have made this Qur’an in Arabic, clear in wording and easy in meaning, without ambiguity or deviation, so that they may fear Allah by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions. God has presented an example of a slave owned by disputing partners, so he is confused about pleasing them, and a slave who is completely owned by one owner, who knows his will and what pleases him. Are they equal in example? They are not equal. Likewise, the polytheist is in confusion and doubt, while the believer is in comfort and reassurance. So complete and perfect praise is for Allah alone. Rather, the polytheists do not know the truth so they follow it. Indeed, you, O Messenger, are dying, and indeed, they are You, O Messenger, will die, and they will die. Then, O people, you will all dispute before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection, and He will judge between you with justice and fairness.
m-0909	No one is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah by attributing to Him what is not befitting of Him, such as a partner or a son, or says, “It was revealed to me,” when nothing was revealed to him. No one is more unjust than he who denies the truth that was revealed to Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Is there not in the Fire a refuge and a dwelling for he who disbelieves in Allah and does not believe in Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and does not act upon what he brought? Yes. And he who brought truth in his words and deeds from the prophets and their followers and believed in him in faith and action, those are the ones who combined the qualities of piety. At the forefront of these is the Seal of the Prophets and Messengers, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the believers in him and those who act upon his law from the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, and those who came after them until the Day of Judgment. They will have whatever they wish with their Lord from the various kinds of desired pleasures. That is the reward of he who obeyed his Lord with true obedience and worshipped Him with true worship. That is so that Allah may remove from them the worst of what they did in this world of deeds because of what they did of repentance and turning back from the evil deeds they committed therein, and Allah will reward them for their obedience in this world with the best of what they used to do, which is Paradise. Is not Allah sufficient for His servant Muhammad? The polytheists and their plots to harm him. Yes, He will suffice him in the matter of his religion and his worldly life, and He will repel from him whoever wants to harm him. And they frighten you, O Messenger, with their gods that they claim will harm you. And he whom Allah forsakes and leads astray from the path of truth, there is no guide for him to it. And he whom Allah guides to believe in Him, to act according to His Book, and to follow His Messenger, there is no misleader for him from the truth which he is upon. Is not Allah Mighty in His vengeance on the disbelievers of His creation and those who disobey Him?
m-0910	And if you ask, O Messenger, these polytheists who worship other than Allah, who created these heavens and the earth, they will say, “Allah created them,” and they acknowledge the Creator. Say to them, “Can these gods that you associate with Allah remove from me a harm that Allah has decreed for me, or remove a calamity that has befallen me? Can they prevent a benefit that Allah has facilitated for me, or withhold the mercy of Allah from me?” They will say, “They cannot do that.” Say to them, “Allah is sufficient for me, and He is sufficient for me.” Those who rely on Him to bring about their interests and repel their harms depend on Him alone. He alone is sufficient for me, and He will suffice me in all that concerns me. Say, O Messenger, to your stubborn people, “Work according to the state that you have accepted for yourselves, where you worshipped one who does not deserve worship and has no say in the matter. I am working according to what I have been commanded to do, turning to Allah alone in my words and actions. You will soon know who will be afflicted with a torment that will humiliate him in this worldly life, and who will be afflicted with an everlasting torment in the Hereafter that will not be removed or diminished.” Say, O Messenger, to your stubborn people, “Work according to the state that you have accepted for yourselves, where you worshipped one who does not deserve worship and has no say in the matter.” He deserves to be worshipped, and he has no say in the matter. I am acting according to what I have been commanded to do, which is to turn to God alone in my words and actions. You will soon know who will be afflicted with a humiliating punishment in this worldly life, and who will be afflicted with an everlasting punishment in the Hereafter that will not be removed or diminished.
m-0911	Indeed, We have sent down to you, O Messenger, the Qur’an in truth as guidance for the worlds to the path of right guidance. So whoever is guided by its light and acts according to what is in it and adheres to its method, then the benefit of that will return to himself. And whoever goes astray after guidance has become clear to him, then his harm will only return to himself, and he will not harm Allah at all. And you, O Messenger, are not a guardian over them. You record their deeds and hold them accountable for them and compel them to do whatever you wish. Your duty is only to convey.
m-0912	Allah, the Almighty, is the One who takes the souls at the time of their death. This is the greater death, the death of death at the expiration of the appointed time. He takes the soul that did not die in its sleep, which is the lesser death. He withholds from these two souls the soul that death decreed, which is the soul of the one who died, and He sends the other soul to complete its appointed time and its provision, by returning it to the body of its owner. Indeed, in Allah’s taking of the soul of the dead and the sleeping, and His sending of the soul of the sleeping, and His withholding of the soul of the dead, there are clear signs of Allah’s power for those who think and reflect. Or have these polytheists taken their gods whom they worship as intercessors with Allah in their needs? Say, O Messenger, to them: “Do you take them as intercessors as you claim, even though the gods do not possess anything and do not understand your worship of them?” Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists: “To Allah belongs all intercession. His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them. So the matter is entirely for Allah alone, and no one intercedes with Him except with His permission. He is the One who possesses the heavens and the earth and disposes of them. So it is obligatory to seek intercession from the One who possesses it, and to devote worship to Him, and not to seek it from these gods that do not harm or benefit. Then to Him is it to Him.” You will return after your death for reckoning and reward.
m-0913	And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the afterlife and resurrection after death are repelled. And when those other than Him are mentioned, such as idols, statues, and saints, then they rejoice because polytheism is in accordance with their whims. Say: O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth and their originator without a previous example, Knower of the secret and the public, You will judge between Your servants on the Day of Resurrection concerning that in which they differed, of speech concerning You and Your greatness and Your authority and belief in You and in Your Messenger. Guide me to the truth concerning that in which they differ, by Your permission. Indeed, You guide whom You will to a straight path. And this was from his supplication, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and it is a teaching to the servants to seek refuge in Allah the Most High and to supplicate to Him by His beautiful names and sublime attributes. And if these polytheists had all that is on earth of wealth and treasures and the same with it multiplied, they would give it on the Day of Resurrection to ransom themselves from the evil of the punishment. And if they gave and ransomed themselves with it, it would not be accepted from them nor would it avail them anything against the punishment of Allah. And on that day, of the command of Allah and His punishment, they would see what they did not expect in this world to befall them. On the Day of Judgment, these deniers will see the punishment for the evil deeds they committed, as they attributed to God what was not befitting of Him and committed sins in their lives. They will be surrounded on every side by a painful punishment as a punishment for their mockery of the warning of the punishment that the Messenger had promised them, and they did not pay attention to it.
m-0914	"So when a person is afflicted with hardship and distress, he asks his Lord to relieve him. But when We remove from him what has afflicted him and give him a favor from Us, he returns to his Lord as a disbeliever and denies His favor and says, ""Indeed, what I have been given is only out of knowledge from Allah that I am worthy of it and deserving of it."" Rather, that is a trial by which Allah tests His servants to see who will thank Him and who will deny Him. But most of them, due to their ignorance and bad opinion and their saying, do not know, therefore they consider the trial to be a gift.

These words of theirs were said by the nations before them who denied Him. But what availed them, when the punishment came to them, was that which they had earned of wealth and children.

So those who said this word from the nations before them were afflicted with the evil consequences of what they had earned of deeds, so they were hastened with disgrace in the life of this world. And those among your people who wronged themselves, O Messenger, and said this word, the evil consequences of what they had earned will also afflict them as it afflicted those before them. But they will not be able to outrun Allah nor will they outpace Him.

Do these people not know that the provision of Allah to a person does not indicate the good condition of its owner? Indeed, Allah is most wise; He expands the provision for whomever He wills of His righteous servants. Whether good or bad, He restricts it for whomever He wills among them. Indeed in that expansion and restriction in provision are clear signs for a people who believe in the command of God and act according to it."
m-0915	"Say, O Messenger, to My servants who persist in sins and have transgressed against themselves by committing what their souls call them to of sins: Do not despair of the mercy of Allah because of the multitude of your sins. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins for whoever repents from them and turns away from them, no matter what they are. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiver of the sins of His repentant servants, the Most Merciful to them. And return to your Lord, O people, with obedience and repentance and submit to Him before His punishment befalls you. Then no one can help you besides Allah. And follow the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord, which is the Great Qur’an, and all of it is good. So comply with its commands and avoid its prohibitions before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you do not know about it. And obey your Lord and repent to Him so that no soul regrets and says, “Oh, how I regret what I wasted in this world of doing what Allah commanded and falling short in obeying Him and His right, and I was in this world among those who mocked the command of Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and the believers in Him.” Or say, “If Allah had guided me to His religion, I would have been among the righteous.” Polytheism and sins
Or you will say when you see the punishment of God surrounding you on the Day of Judgment, “If only I could return to the life of this world so I could be among those who did good by obeying their Lord and doing what the messengers commanded them to do.”
What is the saying as you say, My clear signs have come to you indicating the truth, but you denied them and were too arrogant to accept them and follow them, and you were among the disbelievers in God and His messengers?"
m-0916	"And on the Day of Resurrection, you will see those who denied their Lord, who described Him with what is not befitting of Him, and attributed to Him a partner and a son, their faces will be blackened. Is there not in Hell a refuge and a dwelling for those who were arrogant towards Allah and refused to unify Him and obey Him? Yes.

And Allah will save from Hell and its torment those who feared their Lord by performing His obligations and avoiding His prohibitions, by their success and the fulfillment of their wish, which is to attain Paradise. Nothing of the torment of Hell will touch them, nor will they grieve over what they have missed of the fortunes of this world.

Allah, the Most High, is the Creator of all things, their Lord, their King, and the One who controls them. He is the Guardian over all things, managing all the affairs of His creation.

To Allah belong the keys to the treasuries of the heavens and the earth, from which He gives to His creation as He wills. As for those who denied the verses of the Qur’an and the clear evidences in them, they are the losers in this world by their failure to believe, and in the Hereafter by their eternity in the Fire.

Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists of your people, “Do you command me to worship other than Allah, O ignorant ones of Allah? And worship is not appropriate for anything other than Him.”
And indeed, it has been revealed to you O Messenger and to those messengers before you, if you associate others with Allah, your work will surely be nullified, and you will be among the lost, the losers of your religion and your Hereafter, because no good deed is accepted with polytheism. Rather, worship Allah, O Prophet, sincerely devoting worship to Him alone, with no partner for Him, and be among those who are grateful to Allah for His blessings. These polytheists did not glorify Allah as He should be glorified, since they worshipped others with Him that neither benefit nor harm, so they equated the creation with its weakness with the Great Creator, whose great power includes that all the earth will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be folded in His right hand. He is far removed and exalted, glory be to Him, from what these polytheists associate with Him. In the verse is evidence of the proof of the grip, the right hand, and the folding for Allah as befits His majesty and greatness, without any qualification or likening."
m-0917	And the trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and the earth will die, except for those whom Allah wills not to die. Then the angel will blow into it a second time, announcing the revival of all creation for the reckoning before their Lord. Then they will rise from their graves, looking at what Allah will do with them. And the earth will be illuminated on the Day of Resurrection when the Truth, glory be to Him, is revealed to creation to determine the judgment. And the angels will spread out the record of each individual, and the prophets and witnesses will be brought to the nations so that Allah may ask the prophets about the message and about what their nations responded to them, just as the nation of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, will come to bear witness to the message of the previous messengers to their nations if they denied this message, so the argument will be established against the nations. And the Lord of the Worlds will judge between the servants with complete justice, and they will not be wronged in the least by reducing reward or increasing punishment. And Allah will fully repay every soul for its deeds of good and evil, and He, glory be to Him, is All-Knowing of what they do in this world, whether of obedience or disobedience.
m-0918	"And those who disbelieved in Allah and His messengers will be driven to Hell in groups until, when they reach it, the keepers in charge of it will open its seven gates and rebuke them, saying, ""How can you disobey Allah and deny that He is the only true God? Did He not send to you messengers from among yourselves reciting to you the verses of your Lord and warning you of the terrors of this Day?"" They will say, acknowledging their sin, ""Yes, indeed, the messengers of our Lord have brought the truth and warned us of this Day. But the word of Allah has become binding that His punishment is for those who disbelieve in Him."" It will be said to the disbelievers that Allah is the true God, as an insult and humiliation to them, ""Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein forever."" How ugly is the fate of those who are arrogant about believing in Allah and acting according to His law. And those who feared their Lord by affirming His Oneness and acting in obedience to Him will be driven to Paradise in groups until, when they reach it and its gates are interceded for them, the angels in charge of Paradise will welcome them and greet them with good tidings and joy for their purification from the effects of sins, saying to them, ""Peace be upon you from every affliction. Your condition has become good, so enter Paradise to abide therein."" And the believers will say, ""Praise be to Allah who has confirmed our truth."" His promise which He promised us through the tongues of His messengers, and We have given as inheritance the land of Paradise, from which we may descend wherever we will. How excellent is the reward of the doers of good, who strive in obedience to their Lord. And you will see, O Prophet, the angels surrounding the Throne of the Most Merciful, sanctifying their Lord from everything that is not befitting of Him. And God, glory be to Him, has judged between the creatures with truth and justice, so He has settled the people of faith in Paradise and the people of disbelief in Hell. And it has been said, “Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds, for what He has judged between the people of Paradise and the people of Hell.” Praise of grace and kindness, praise of justice and wisdom."
m-0919	"Ha Mim, the disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

The revelation of the Qur’an to the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, was from God Almighty, the Almighty, who subdued every creature with His might, the All-Knowing of everything

The forgiver of sins for sinners and the Accepter of repentance from those who repent, the severe in punishment for those who dare to sin and do not repent from them, and He, glory be to Him, is the Owner of bounty and favor upon His obedient servants. There is no deity worthy of worship except Him. To Him is the destination of all creatures on the Day of Judgment, and He will reward each one according to what he deserves

None disputes the verses of the Qur’an and its evidence for the Oneness of God and confronts them with falsehood except the deniers who denied that He is the true God who alone deserves to be worshipped. So do not be deceived, O Messenger, by their wandering around the lands in various forms of trade, earnings, and the pleasures and adornments of this world."
m-0920	Before these disbelievers, the people of Noah and the nations that followed them who declared war on the messengers, such as Aad and Thamud, denied them, as they resolved to harm them and gathered against them with torture or killing. Each of these nations that denied their messenger intended to kill him, and they disputed falsely to invalidate the truth with their arguments. So I punished them. How was My punishment of them? It is a lesson for creation and a sermon for those who come after them. Just as the punishment was due to the previous nations that denied their messengers, it is due to those who disbelieved that they are the companions of the Fire.
m-0921	Those who carry the Throne of the Most Gracious from among the angels and those around the Throne from among them who surround it, declare Allah free from every deficiency and praise Him as He deserves and believe in Him as He should be believed and ask Him to pardon the believers, saying, “Our Lord, You have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge. So forgive those who have repented from polytheism and sins and followed the path which You have commanded them to follow, which is Islam, and spare them the punishment of the Fire and its terrors. Our Lord, and admit the believers to the Gardens of Eden which You have promised them and to those who are righteous through faith and righteous deeds among their fathers, their spouses, and their children. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Prevailing over all things, the Wise in His management and making. And avert from them the evil consequences of their misdeeds, so do not hold them accountable for them. And whoever You avert evil deeds from on the Day of Reckoning - then You have had mercy on him and bestowed upon him salvation from Your punishment. And that is the great triumph, the like of which is no victory.”
m-0922	Those who denied that Allah is the true God and devoted worship to other than Him, when they witness the horrors of Hell with their own eyes, will hate themselves with the utmost hatred. Then the keepers of Hell will call out to them, “Allah’s hatred for you in this world when He asked you to believe in Him and follow His messengers, but you refused, is greater than your hatred for yourselves now that you have realized that you deserve Allah’s wrath and punishment.” The disbelievers will say, “Our Lord, You caused us to die twice, when we were in the wombs of our mothers as sperm before the soul was breathed into us, and when our term in this worldly life was completed. And You gave us life twice in this worldly home, the day we were born and the day You raised us from our graves.” So now we acknowledge our past mistakes. Is there a way for us to get out of the Fire and for You to return us to this world so that we may work in Your obedience? But it is unlikely that this admission will benefit them. This is the punishment that is upon you, O disbelievers, because when you were called to the Oneness of Allah and to work sincerely for Him, you disbelieved in Him. And if He assigns a partner to Allah, you give him charity and follow him. Allah, the Most High, is the Judge over His creation, the Just, who does not…” He guides whom He wills and misguides whom He wills, and He has mercy on whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. There is no god but He, to whom belongs the loftiness of the self, the power, and the dominance, and to Him belong pride and greatness.
m-0923	It is He who shows you, O people, His power through what you see of the great signs that indicate the perfection of their Creator and Maker, and He sends down for you from the sky rain by which you are provided. None remembers these signs except he who returns to the obedience of Allah and sincerely worships Him. So, O believers, be sincere in worship and supplication to Allah alone, and oppose the polytheists in their conduct, even if that angers them, so do not pay attention to them. Indeed, Allah is the Most High, the Most High, whose degrees have risen to a height that distinguishes Him from His creatures and His status has risen. He is the Owner of the Mighty Throne. And from His mercy to His servants, He sends to them messengers who convey to them the revelation by which they live, so that they may have insight into their affair, so that the messengers may frighten the servants of Allah and warn them of the Day of Resurrection, on which the first and the last will meet. On the Day of Resurrection, the creatures will appear before their Lord. Nothing about them or the deeds they did in this world will be hidden from Allah. Allah, the Exalted, will say, “To whom belongs the kingdom and the disposition on this Day?” He will answer Himself to Allah, the Unique in His names, attributes, and actions, the Subduer, who has subdued all creatures with His power and might. Today every soul will be rewarded for what it has earned in The world is full of good and evil. No one will be wronged today by increasing his bad deeds or decreasing his good deeds. Indeed, Allah, the Most High, is swift in reckoning, so do not be impatient for that day, for it is near. And warn people, O Messenger, of the near Day of Resurrection, even if they think it is unlikely, for the hearts of the servants have risen from their chests out of fear of Allah’s punishment and have become attached to their throats, and they are filled with grief and sorrow. The wrongdoers have no relative, companion, or intercessor to intercede for them with their Lord, so that their supplications may be answered. Allah, the Most High, knows what the eyes steal of glances and what a person conceals in his soul of good or evil. And Allah, the Most High, judges between people with justice in what they deserve. And those who worship other than Allah of deities do not judge at all because of their inability to do so. Indeed, Allah is the Hearer of what your tongues utter, the Seeer of your actions and deeds, and He will reward you for them.
m-0924	Did not these deniers of your message, O Messenger, travel through the land and see how was the end of the previous nations before them? They were stronger than them in power and left traces on the earth, but their great strength and huge bodies did not benefit them, so God seized them with His punishment because of their disbelief and their acquisition of sins, and they had no protector from God’s punishment to protect them from it and repel it from them. That punishment that befell the previous deniers was because of their position towards God’s messengers who came with conclusive evidence of the truth of their claim, so they disbelieved in them and denied them, so God seized them with His punishment. Indeed, He is Almighty, and no one can overcome Him. He is severe in punishment for those who disbelieve in Him and disobey Him.
m-0925	"And We sent Moses with Our great signs indicating the truth of what he was sent with and a clear and evident proof of his truthfulness in his call and the falsehood of what he was sent to them

To Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and Haman, his minister, and Qarun, the owner of wealth and treasures, but they denied his message and were arrogant and said about him that he was a magician and a liar, so how can he claim that he was sent to the people as a messenger?

So when Moses came to Pharaoh, Haman, and Qarun with the apparent miracles from Us, they were not satisfied with opposing and denying them, but they said, Kill the sons of those who believed with him and keep their women for service and enslavement, and the plot of the people of disbelief is nothing but destruction and ruin.

And Pharaoh said to the nobles of his people, Leave me to kill Moses, and let him call upon his Lord, whom he claims sent him to us, to protect him from us. Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion which you are following or that corruption will appear in the land of Egypt.

And Moses said to Pharaoh and his chiefs, Indeed, I seek refuge in my Lord and your Lord, O my people, from every arrogant person who rejects the Oneness of Allah and obeys Him and does not believe in the Day when Allah will hold His creation accountable."
m-0926	"A man from the family of Pharaoh who believed in God and concealed his faith, denying it to his people, said, ""How can you consider it permissible to kill a man who has no crime in your eyes except that he says, 'My Lord is God,' and he has come to you with conclusive proofs from your Lord that what he says is true? If Moses is a liar, then the consequences of his lie will come back to him alone. But if he is truthful, then some of what he threatens you with will come to you. God does not guide to the truth one who transgresses the limits by abandoning the truth and turning to falsehood. He is a liar in his attribution of what he has transgressed to God. O my people, you have authority today, prevailing in the land of Egypt over your subjects from the Children of Israel and others. So who can avert from us the punishment of God if it befalls us?"" Pharaoh said to his people, ""I do not show you, O people, any advice or opinion except what I see to be good and right for myself and for you. I do not call you except to the path of truth and right."" And the believing man from the family of Pharaoh said to Pharaoh and his chiefs, admonishing and warning, ""Indeed, I fear for you, if you kill Moses, something like the day of the parties who formed parties against their prophets."" Like the custom of the people of Noah, 'Aad, Thamud, and those who came after them. After them in disbelief and denial, Allah destroyed them because of that. Allah, the Exalted, does not want injustice for His servants, so He punishes them for no sin they committed. Allah is far above injustice and deficiency, far above. O my people, I fear for you the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, the day when some people will call out to others because of the horror of the situation. That is the day when you will turn away, fleeing. You will have no protector from Allah to protect you or supporter to aid you. And he whom Allah forsakes and does not guide to his right path, he will have no guide to show him the truth and right path."
m-0927	And Allah sent to you the noble Prophet Joseph, son of Jacob, peace be upon them, before Moses, with clear evidence of his truthfulness and commanded you to worship Allah alone, with no partner for Him. But you remained doubtful about what he brought to you during his lifetime, until when he died, your doubts and polytheism increased, and you said, “Allah will never send after him a messenger like that.” Allah misguides everyone who transgresses the truth and doubts the Oneness of Allah, the Most High, and does not guide him to guidance and righteousness. Those who dispute about the verses of Allah and His proofs to refute them without having an acceptable proof. Such argument is most hateful to Allah and to those who believe. He also sealed the hearts of these disputers with misguidance and veiled them from guidance. Allah seals the heart of every arrogant person who refuses to worship Allah alone and obey Him, a tyrant with his many injustices and aggressions.
m-0928	"And Pharaoh said, denying Moses' call to acknowledge the Lord of the worlds and submit to Him, ""O Haman, build me a great building that I may reach the gates of the heavens and what will lead me to them, and I may see the God of Moses for myself. Indeed, I think Moses is a liar in his claim that we have a Lord and that He is above the heavens."" Thus, his evil deed was made attractive to Pharaoh, so he saw it as good, and he was turned away from the path of truth because of the falsehood that was made attractive to him. And Pharaoh's trickery and planning to make people think that he was right and Moses was wrong will lead to nothing but loss and ruin, and will not benefit him except misery in this world and the Hereafter. And Pharaoh said, denying Moses' call to acknowledge the Lord of the worlds and submit to Him, ""O Haman, build me a great building that I may reach the gates of the heavens and what will lead me to them, and I may see the God of Moses for myself. Indeed, I think Moses is a liar in his claim that we have a Lord and that He is above the heavens."" Thus, his evil deed was made attractive to Pharaoh, so he saw it as good, and he was turned away from the path of truth because of the falsehood that was made attractive to him. And Pharaoh's trickery and planning to make people think that he was right and Moses was wrong will lead to nothing but loss and ruin, and will not benefit him except misery in this world and the Hereafter. And a ruin that will only bring misery in this world and the hereafter."
m-0929	"And the one who believed said, repeating his advice to his people, ""O my people, follow me; I will guide you to the path of right conduct and righteousness."" O my people, this worldly life is a life in which people enjoy themselves for a little while, then it ends and passes away, so you should not incline to it. The Hereafter, with its eternal bliss, is the place of residence in which you will settle, so you should prefer it and do righteous deeds for it that will make you happy therein. Whoever disobeys Allah in his life and deviates from the path of guidance will not be rewarded in the Hereafter except with a punishment equal to his disobedience. But whoever obeys Allah and does righteous deeds by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, whether male or female, and believes in Allah and is one of His Oneness, those will enter Paradise, and Allah will provide for them therein from its fruits, pleasures, and delights without account. O my people, how can I call you to believe in Allah and follow His Messenger Moses, which is a call that will lead you to Paradise and away from the terrors of Hell, while you call me to do deeds that lead to Allah's punishment and punishment in Hell? You call me to disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that which I have no knowledge that deserves worship besides Him. This is one of the greatest Sins and the ugliest of them, and I call you to the path that leads to God Almighty in His vengeance, the Forgiving, for those who repent to Him after disobeying Him.

Truly, what you call me to believe in is not worth calling to, nor is it resorted to in this world or in the hereafter, due to its weakness and deficiency. Know that the fate of all creatures is with God Almighty, and He rewards every worker according to his work, and that those who transgressed His limits with sins, bloodshed, and disbelief are the people of Hell.

So when he advised them and they did not obey him, he said to them, “You will remember that I advised you and reminded you, and you will regret where regret is of no use. I will resort to God, hold fast to Him, and trust in Him. Indeed, God Almighty is All-Seeing of the conditions of His servants and what they deserve of retribution, nothing of it is hidden from Him.”

So God Almighty protected that believing, successful man from the punishments of Pharaoh and his family’s plot, and the worst torment befell them, as God drowned them all.

They were first afflicted by drowning and perished, then they will be tormented in their graves where the Fire is presented to them morning and evening until the time of reckoning, and on the Day of Judgment it will be said, “Enter the family of Pharaoh into the Fire.” The punishment for the evil deeds they committed, and this verse is the basis for proving the torment of the grave."
m-0930	"And when the people of Hell quarrel and reproach each other, the imitating followers will argue with their arrogant leaders who led them astray and made the path of misery seem attractive to them, saying, “Can you spare us a share of the Fire by bearing a portion of our punishment?” The arrogant leaders will say, showing their inability, “We cannot bear for you any of the punishment of the Fire, and we are all in it, with no escape from it. Indeed, Allah has divided the punishment among us in proportion to what each of us deserves, by His just judgment.” And those in the Fire from among the arrogant and weak will say to the keepers of Hell, “Call upon your Lord to lighten our punishment for one day so that we may obtain some relief.” The keepers of Hell will say to them, rebuking them, “This supplication will not benefit you at all. Did not your messengers come to you with clear proofs from Allah, and you denied them?” The deniers will acknowledge that and say, “Yes.” Then the keepers of Hell will disown them and say, “We will not supplicate for you nor will we intercede for you. So supplicate yourselves, but this supplication will not avail at all, because you are…” Disbelievers, and the supplication of the disbelievers is nothing but loss, neither accepted nor answered.

We will surely support Our messengers and those who follow them among the believers, and We will support them against those who harmed them in their worldly life. And on the Day of Resurrection, the angels, the prophets, and the believers will bear witness against the nations who denied their messengers, and they will bear witness that the messengers delivered the messages of their Lord and that the nations denied them.

On the Day of Reckoning, the disbelievers who transgressed the limits of Allah will not benefit from what they offer as an excuse for denying the messengers of Allah, and they will be expelled from the mercy of Allah, and they will have the evil home in the Hereafter, which is the Fire."
m-0931	"And We gave Moses that which guides to the truth of the Torah and miracles, and We made the Children of Israel inherit the Torah, successive generations, as a guide to the path of right conduct and an admonition for those of sound minds.

So be patient, O Messenger, with the harm of the polytheists, for We have promised you to exalt your word, and Our promise is true and will not fail. And seek forgiveness for your sin and persist in declaring your Lord free from that which is not befitting of Him at the end of the day and the beginning of it.

Indeed, those who repel the truth with falsehood and reject sound arguments with corrupt doubts without proof or argument from Allah, there is nothing in the hearts of these people except arrogance towards the truth, out of envy on their part for the favor which Allah has given to His Prophet and the honor of prophethood with which He has honored him, which is something they will not attain or attain. So hold fast to Allah from their evil, for He is the Hearer of their words, the Seeer of their actions, and He will reward them for it.

The creation of Allah the heavens and the earth is greater. Who created mankind and brought them back after their death, but most people do not know that the creation of all that is easy for Allah. The blind and the seeing are not equal. Likewise, the believers who acknowledge that Allah is the true God, with no partner or associate, and respond to His messengers and act according to His law, are not equal to the deniers who deny that Allah is the true God and belie His messengers and do not act according to His law. Little do you remember, O people, the proofs of Allah, so that you may consider and learn from them."
m-0932	The Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it, so be certain of its coming, as the messengers have informed us, but most people do not believe in its coming, nor do they work for it. Your Lord says, “O servants, call upon Me alone and single Me out for worship; I will respond to you. Indeed, those who are too arrogant to single Me out for worship and divinity will enter Hell, humiliated and contemptible.”
m-0933	Allah alone is the One Who has made the night for you to rest in and achieve your comfort, and the day to shine in it for you to manage your livelihood affairs. Indeed, Allah is of great favor to people, but most of them do not thank Him through obedience and sincere worship. The One Who has bestowed these blessings upon you is your Lord, the Creator of all things. There is no god worthy of worship other than Him. So how can you turn away from believing in Him and worship other than Him from idols after His proofs have been made clear to you? Just as you denied the truth, O disbelievers of Quraysh, and turned away from it to falsehood, those who used to deny the proofs and evidence of Allah are turned away from the truth and belief in Him. Allah is the One Who has made the earth for you to settle in it and made it easy for you to reside on it and made the sky a ceiling for the earth and spread throughout it guiding signs and created you in the most perfect form and the best stature and bestowed upon you lawful provision and delicious foods and drinks. That is the One Who has bestowed these blessings upon you. He is your Lord, so His goodness, favor, and blessings are abundant. He is far removed from what is not befitting of Him, and He is the Lord of all creation. He is Allah, the Ever-Living, to whom belongs the perfect and complete life. There is no god other than Him, so ask Him. And devote your worship to Him alone, making your religion and obedience sincere to Him. So all praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Lord of all creation. Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists of your people, “I have been forbidden to worship those you call upon besides Allah, since the clear signs have come to me from my Lord, and He has commanded me to submit and obey Him in complete obedience.” Glory be to Him, the Lord of the worlds.
m-0934	It is Allah who created your father Adam from dust, then He created you from semen by His power. After that, you move to the stage of thick red blood, then you go through various stages in the wombs until you are born as small children, then your structure becomes strong until you become old men, and some of you die before that, and in these destined stages, you reach a specified term at which your lives end, and perhaps you will understand the arguments of Allah against you in this and ponder His signs, and you will know that there is no god but Him who does that, and that He is the One who should be worshipped except Him. He, glory be to Him, is the One who gives life and causes death. So when He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is. There is no one who can repel His decree.
m-0935	Are you not amazed, O Messenger, at those who deny the verses of Allah, who dispute about them, and they are clear evidence of the Oneness of Allah and His power? How do they turn away from them, despite their soundness? And to what do they go after the complete clarification? These polytheists who denied the Qur’an and the heavenly books that Allah sent down to His messengers to guide the people, then these deniers will know the consequences of their denial when the shackles are placed on their necks and the chains on their feet, and the guards of punishment will drag them into the boiling hot water, then into the fire of Hell, burning them. These polytheists who denied the Qur’an and the heavenly books that Allah sent down to His messengers to guide the people, then these deniers will know the consequences of their denial when the shackles are placed on their necks and the chains on their feet, and the guards of punishment will drag them into the boiling hot water, then into the fire of Hell, burning them. His messengers to guide the people, then these deniers will know the consequence of their denial when the shackles are placed on their necks and the chains on their feet and the guards of torment drag them into the boiling water, and then into the fire of Hell, which is kindled with them. Then it will be said to them, as a rebuke, while they are in this wretched state, “Where are the gods that you used to worship besides Allah? Will they help you today? Call upon them to save you from this calamity that has befallen you, if they are able?” The deniers will say, “They have disappeared from our sight, so they did not benefit us at all.” They will admit that they were in ignorance of their affair and that their worship of them was false and worthless, just as Allah has led astray those whom He has led astray in Hell, what they used to worship in this world besides Allah. Allah leads astray the disbelievers in Him. Then it will be said to them, as a rebuke, while they are in this wretched state, “Where are the gods that you used to worship besides Allah? Will they help you today? Call upon them to save you from this calamity that has befallen you, if they are able?” The deniers will say, “They have disappeared from our sight, so they did not benefit us at all.” They will admit That they were in ignorance of their affair and that their worship of them was false and worthless, just as Allah has led astray those whom He has led astray in Hell, what they used to worship in this world besides Allah. Allah leads astray those who disbelieve in Him. That torment that has befallen you is only because of what you were upon in your worldly life of heedlessness, where you were rejoicing in what you were committing of sins and crimes and what you were upon of evil, arrogance and oppression against the servants of Allah. Enter the gates of Hell as a punishment for you for your disbelief in Allah and your disobedience to Him, abiding therein. How evil is Hell as a dwelling for those who are arrogant in this world against Allah. So be patient, O Messenger, and continue on the path of calling to Allah. Indeed, the promise of Allah is true, and He will fulfill for you what He has promised you. Either We show you in your life some of what We promise these polytheists of punishment, or We cause you to die before that befalls them. To Us is their destination on the Day of Resurrection, and We will make them taste the severe punishment for what they used to disbelieve.
m-0936	And We had sent before you, O Messenger, many messengers to their people, calling them and being patient with their harm. Among them are those whose story We have told you, and among them are those We have not told you. And all of them were commanded to convey the revelation of God to them. And it was not for any of them to bring a sign from the sensory or rational signs except by the permission and will of God. But when the command of God comes to punish the deniers, justice will be judged between the messengers and their deniers, and there the falsifiers will lose out because they fabricated lies against God and worshipped other than Him.
m-0937	Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who made the livestock for you so that you may benefit from them in terms of riding, eating, and other types of benefits, and so that you may reach, by carrying on some of them, a need in your hearts to reach distant lands, and on these livestock you are carried in the wilderness and on ships in the sea, and so on. And Allah, the Exalted, shows you His many clear signs indicating His power and management in His creation, so which of His signs do you deny and do not acknowledge? Have these deniers not traveled on the earth and pondered over the fates of the nations who denied before them, how their end was, and these previous nations were more numerous and more numerous than them in number and equipment and left traces on the earth of buildings, factories, crops, and other things, but what they earned did not avail them when the wrath of Allah befell them. So when these nations who denied came to them, their messengers They rejoiced in the clear evidence, out of ignorance of what they had of knowledge that contradicted what the messengers had brought, and the punishment that they had been hastening from their messengers as a way of mockery and derision befell them. In the verse is evidence that any knowledge that contradicts Islam or casts doubt on it or casts doubt on its authenticity is reprehensible and detestable, and its believer is not from the followers of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. So when they saw Our punishment, they acknowledged it when acknowledgment is of no use, and they said, “We believe in God alone and we disbelieve in what we used to associate with Him in the worship of God.” So their faith did not benefit them when they saw Our punishment, because it was a faith that they were forced to, not a faith of choice and desire. It is the law of God and His method that He has established for all nations that faith will not benefit them when they see the punishment, and when the punishment of God comes, the disbelievers in their Lord, the deniers of His Oneness and obedience to Him perish.
m-0938	"Ha Mim, the disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

This Noble Qur’an is a revelation from the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, sent down to His Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace

A Book whose verses have been made completely clear and whose meanings and rulings have been made clear, an Arabic Qur’an, easy to understand for a people who know the Arabic language

A bearer of good tidings of immediate and deferred reward for those who believe in it and act according to its requirements, and a warner of immediate and deferred punishment for those who disbelieve in it, but most people turn away from it, so they do not listen to it with acceptance and response

And these turning away disbelievers said to the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “Our hearts are covered, preventing us from understanding what you are calling us to, and in our ears is deafness, so we do not hear, and between us and you, O Muhammad, is a veil that prevents us from responding to your call, so act in accordance with your religion, just as we act in accordance with our religion.”

Say to them, O Messenger, “I am only a human being like you. God has revealed to me that your god, who deserves to be worshipped, is One God, with no partner. So follow the path that leads to Him and seek His forgiveness. And a punishment for the polytheists who worshipped idols besides God that neither benefit nor harm.” And those who do not purify themselves by believing in the Oneness of their Lord and being sincere to Him, and do not pray or purify themselves, then there is no sincerity on their part for the Creator, nor is there any benefit in them for the creation, and they do not believe in the Resurrection, nor in Paradise or Hell, nor do they spend in the obedience of Allah. Say to them, O Messenger, I am only a human being like you. Allah has revealed to me that your God who deserves worship is One God, with no partner. So follow the path that leads to Him and seek His forgiveness. And a punishment for the polytheists who worshipped idols besides Allah, which neither benefit nor harm. And those who do not purify themselves by believing in the Oneness of their Lord and being sincere to Him, and do not pray or purify themselves, then there is no sincerity on their part for the Creator, nor is there any benefit in them for the creation, and they do not believe in the Resurrection, nor in Paradise or Hell, nor do they spend in the obedience of Allah. Indeed, those who believe in Allah, His Messenger, and His Book, and do righteous deeds, sincerely for Allah, will have a great reward, neither cut off nor withheld."
m-0939	Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, rebuking them and astonishing at their actions: Do you indeed disbelieve in Allah, Who created the earth in two days, and do you make for Him peers and partners whom you worship along with Him? That is the Creator, He is the Lord of all the worlds. And He, glory be to Him, placed on the earth mountains fixed above it, and blessed it, making it a permanent source of good for its people, and measured therein the provisions of its people from food and what is suitable for them from livelihood in four days: two days in which He created the earth, and two days in which He placed firm mountains therein, and measured therein its sustenance, equal for those who ask, that is, for whoever wants to ask about that, so that He may know it. Then He, glory be to Him, the Most High, rose up, that is, He directed towards the sky, and it was smoke before, and He said to the sky and the earth, “Submit to My command, willingly or compelled.” They said, “We have come in submission to You. We have no will that contradicts Your will.” So Allah decreed the creation of the seven heavens and their leveling in two days, and thus the creation of the heavens and the earth was completed in six days for a wisdom that Allah knows, despite His ability, glory be to Him, to create them in a single moment, and He inspired in each heaven What He wanted and what He commanded therein, and We adorned the lowest heaven with shining stars and to protect it from the devils who eavesdrop. That is the wondrous creation, the decree of the Almighty in His kingdom, the All-Knowing, whose knowledge encompasses all things.
m-0940	"If these deniers turn away after the praiseworthy descriptions of the Qur’an and the attributes of the Almighty God have been made clear to them, then say to them, “I have warned you of a punishment that will uproot you like the punishment of ‘Aad and Thamud when they disbelieved in their Lord and disobeyed His messengers.” When the messengers came to ‘Aad and Thamud, one after the other, commanding them to worship God alone, with no partner for Him, they said to their messengers, “If our Lord had willed that we should worship Him alone and not worship anything besides Him, He would have sent down to us angels from the heaven as messengers with what you call us to.” And He did not send you, while you are human beings like us, for indeed, we deny what God has sent you with to us of belief in God alone. As for ‘Aad, the people of Hud, they have arrogated to the servants on earth without right and said in delusion, “Who is stronger than us in strength?” Did they not see that God, the Most High, who created them, is stronger than them in strength and might? And they used to deny Our proofs and arguments. So We sent upon them a violent, cold wind, loud in days of ill omen for them, that We might make them taste the punishment of humiliation and disgrace in the life of this world. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more humiliating.” And We have disgraced them, and they will not be helped by preventing the punishment from them.

As for Thamud, the people of Salih, We showed them the path of truth and the way of guidance, but they chose blindness over guidance, so the thunderbolt of humiliating punishment destroyed them because of the sins they committed by disbelieving in God and denying His messengers.

And We saved those who believed from the punishment that seized ‘Aad and Thamud, and these survivors feared God and were pious to Him."
m-0941	And on the Day when the enemies of Allah are gathered to the Fire of Hell, the guards of punishment will return them, the first of them to the last of them, until, when they come to the Fire and deny their crimes, their hearing, their sight, and their skins will testify against them for what they used to do in the world of sins and wrongdoings. And those of the enemies of Allah who are gathered to the Fire will say to their skins, reproaching them, “Why did you testify against us?” And their skins will respond, “Allah has made us speak, He who has made all things speak. And He is the One who created you the first time, when you were nothing. And to Him is your final destination after death for reckoning and recompense.” And you were not hiding when you committed sins for fear that your hearing, your sight, and your skins would testify against you on the Day of Resurrection, but you thought, by committing sins, that Allah did not know many of the deeds by which you disobeyed Allah. And that is your evil assumption. You thought that your Lord had destroyed you and led you to the Fire, so today you have become among the losers who have lost themselves and their families. You did not hide your sins when you committed them for fear that your ears, your eyes, and your skins would testify against you on the Day of Resurrection, but you thought that by committing sins you did not know much of the deeds by which you disobeyed Allah. That is your evil assumption that you thought about your Lord. He destroyed you and led you to the Fire, so today you have become among the losers who have lost themselves and their families. If they are patient with the punishment, then the Fire is their home, and if they ask to return to the world to resume righteous deeds, they will not be answered, nor will their excuses be accepted.
m-0942	And We have prepared for these unjust and ungrateful people corrupt companions from among the devils of mankind and jinn, so they made their ugly deeds in this world seem good to them and called them to its pleasures and forbidden desires, and made what is left behind them of the affairs of the Hereafter seem good to them, so they forgot to mention it and called them to deny the Resurrection. Thus, they deserved to enter the Fire along with previous nations of disbelieving jinn and mankind. Indeed, they were losers of their deeds in this world, and of themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. And the disbelievers said to one another, advising one another, “Do not listen to this Qur’an, nor obey it, nor submit to its commands, and raise your voices in shouting, whistling, and commotion against Muhammad when he recites the Qur’an, that you may overcome him so that he may stop reciting and we may triumph over him.” So We will surely make those who said this statement taste a severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and We will surely recompense them for the worst of what they used to do of evil deeds. This is the recompense with which these disbelievers will be recompensed, the recompense of the enemies of Allah, the Fire, for them therein is the eternal home of eternity, as recompense for what they used to deny in this world, with Our proofs and evidence. And the verse indicates the greatness of It is a crime to turn people away from the Great Qur’an and prevent them from contemplating it and its guidance by any means. Those who disbelieved in God and His Messenger and are in the Fire will say, “Our Lord, show us those who led us astray from among Your creation of jinn and mankind so that we may place them under our feet so that they may be in the lowest depths of the Fire.”
m-0943	Indeed, those who say, “Our Lord is Allah, the One, without partner,” and then remain steadfast in His law, the angels will descend upon them at death, saying, “Do not fear death and what comes after it, and do not grieve over what you leave behind you of worldly matters, but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised.” The angels will say to them, “We are your supporters in the worldly life. We will guide you and protect you by Allah’s command. And thus will we be with you in the Hereafter. And for you in Paradise is whatever your souls desire of what you choose and what will delight your eyes. And whatever you ask for, you will find it before you as hospitality and favor from One who is Forgiving of your sins and Merciful to you.”
m-0944	No one speaks better than one who calls to the oneness of Allah and worshipping Him alone and does good deeds and says, “I am one of the Muslims who submit to the command of Allah and His law.” The verse urges calling to Allah, the Exalted, and explains the virtue of scholars who call to Him with insight, according to what came from the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. The good deeds of those who believe in Allah, adhere to His law, and do good to His creation are not equal to the evil deeds of those who disbelieve in Him, disobey His command, and do evil to His creation. Repel with your forgiveness, patience, and good deeds the one who wrongs you and responds to his wrongdoing with goodness. Thus, the one who wrongs you, between whom and you there is enmity, becomes as if he were a close relative who is compassionate toward you. None is granted this praiseworthy trait except those who are patient with what they dislike and force themselves to do what Allah loves. None is granted this except one who has a great share of happiness in this world and the hereafter. The good deeds of those who believe in Allah, adhere to His law, and do good to His creation are not equal to the evil deeds of those who disbelieve in Him, disobey His command, and do evil to His creation. Repel By your forgiveness, patience and kindness, whoever wrongs you and responds to his wrong with kindness, then the wrongdoer who is between you and him becomes like a close relative who is compassionate towards you. And none is granted this praiseworthy trait except those who are patient with what they dislike and force themselves to do what Allah loves. And none is granted this except one who has a great share of happiness in this world and the Hereafter. But if Satan casts into your soul a whisper from the talk of the soul to make you repay the wrongdoer with wrong, then seek refuge with Allah and hold fast to Him. Indeed, Allah is the Hearer of your seeking refuge in Him, the Knower of all the affairs of His creation.
m-0945	And among the proofs of Allah to His creation and His evidence of His Oneness and the perfection of His power is the alternation of night and day and their succession, and the alternation of the sun and moon and their succession. All of that is under His control and His dominance. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, for they are both created and managed. Prostrate to Allah who created them, if you are truly submissive to His command, listening and obedient to Him, worshipping Him alone, with no partner for Him. If these polytheists are too proud to prostrate to Allah, then the angels who are with your Lord are not too proud to do so, but rather they glorify Him and declare Him free from all imperfection by night and by day, and they do not cease or get tired of that. And among the signs of Allah’s Oneness and Power is that you see the earth dry with no vegetation in it, but when We send down rain upon it, life springs into it and it moves with vegetation and swells and rises. Indeed, He who revives this earth after its inertia is able to revive creation after their death. Indeed, He is able to do all things. Just as His power is not incapable of reviving the earth after its death, likewise it is not incapable of reviving the dead.
m-0946	Those who deviate from the truth and disbelieve in the Qur’an and distort it are not hidden from us, rather we are aware of them. Is this atheist who is cast into the Fire better, or the one who comes on the Day of Resurrection safe from the punishment of Allah, deserving of His reward for his belief in Him and his confirmation of His verses? Do, O atheists, whatever you wish, for Allah is All-Seeing of your deeds, nothing of them is hidden from Him, and He will reward you for that. In this is a warning and a threat to them. Indeed, those who denied this Qur’an and belied it when it came to them are doomed and being punished. And indeed, this Qur’an is a noble Book, by Allah’s honoring it and preserving it from every change or alteration. Falsehood cannot come to it from any side, nor can anything invalidate it. It is protected from being diminished or added to it. It is a revelation from the Wise, who manages the affairs of His servants, praised for His attributes of perfection ... Its aspects and nothing can invalidate it, for it is protected from being diminished or added to. It is a revelation from the Wise One who manages the affairs of His servants, praised for His attributes of perfection. What these polytheists say to you, O Messenger, is only what the nations before them said to their messengers. So be patient over what befalls you in the way of calling to Allah. Indeed, your Lord is the possessor of forgiveness for the sins of those who repent, and the possessor of punishment for those who persist in their disbelief and denial. And if We had made this Qur’an which We have revealed to you, O Messenger, foreign, the polytheists would have said, “Why were its verses not made clear so that we might understand it and teach it?” Is this Qur’an foreign, and the language of the one to whom it was revealed is Arabic? This will not happen. Say to them, O Messenger, “This Qur’an is for those who believe in Allah and His Messenger, a guidance from misguidance and a healing for what is in the hearts of doubts and diseases.” But those who do not believe in the Qur’an have deafness in their ears from hearing it and pondering it, and it is blindness on their hearts, so they are not guided by it. Those polytheists are like someone who is called while he is in a distant place, he does not hear the caller nor respond to the caller.
m-0947	And We gave Moses the Torah, just as We gave you, O Messenger, the Qur’an. But his people differed concerning it. Some of them believed and some of them denied. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord, delaying the punishment from your people, He would have judged between them by destroying the disbelievers immediately. And indeed, the polytheists are in doubt about the Qur’an, intense doubt. Whoever does righteousness and obeys Allah and His Messenger, then for himself is the reward of his work. But whoever does evil and disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then upon himself is the burden of his work. And your Lord is not unjust to His servants, by decreasing a good deed or increasing an evil.
m-0948	To Allah the Most High alone, with no partner, is the knowledge of the Hour returned, for no one knows when it will come except Him. No fruit emerges from its vessels, nor does a female conceive or give birth, except with knowledge from Allah. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. And on the Day when Allah the Most High will call out to the polytheists on the Day of Resurrection, rebuking them and revealing their lie, “Where are My partners whom you used to associate with Me in worship?” They will say, “We have informed you now that there is not one of us who testifies today that there is a partner with You.” And the partners whom they used to worship besides Allah have departed from these polytheists, so they did not benefit them, and they were certain that they have no refuge from the punishment of Allah, nor any escape from it.
m-0949	"Man never gets tired of supplicating to his Lord, seeking worldly goodness, and if poverty and hardship befall him, he despairs of Allah's mercy, despairing of his bad opinion of his Lord.

And if We let man taste a blessing from Us after hardship and affliction, he does not thank Allah, but rather becomes arrogant and says, ""This has come to me because I deserve it, and I do not believe that the Hour is coming."" This is a denial on his part of the Resurrection. And if the Hour comes and I will return to my Lord, then I will have Paradise with Him, then We will surely inform those who disbelieve on the Day of Resurrection of what they did of evil deeds, and We will surely make them taste of the severe punishment.

And if We bestow upon man health, provision, or other things, he turns away and is above submitting to the truth. If harm befalls him, he is a person who prays a lot that Allah will remove his harm, for he knows his Lord in times of hardship and does not know Him in times of ease.

Say, O Messenger, to these deniers, tell me, if this Qur'an is from Allah, then you denied and belied it, no one is more astray than you, because you are in disagreement far from the truth by your disbelief in the Qur'an and your belief in it."
m-0950	We will show these deniers Our signs of conquests and the emergence of Islam over the regions and all other religions and in the regions of the heavens and the earth and what Allah brings about in them of great events and in themselves and what they contain of the wondrous signs of Allah and the wonders of His creation until it becomes clear to them from those signs a statement that does not accept doubt that the Noble Qur’an is the truth revealed from the Lord of the Worlds. Is it not sufficient evidence for them that the Qur’an is the truth and whoever brings it is true to the testimony of Allah Almighty? He has testified to his truthfulness and He is a Witness over all things and there is nothing greater testimony than His testimony, glory be to Him and He is Most High. Beware, these disbelievers are in great doubt about the resurrection after death. Beware, Allah, the Most High, encompasses everything in knowledge, power and glory. Nothing is hidden from Him on earth or in heaven.
m-0951	"Ha Mim Ain Qaf The speech about the disconnected letters was previously mentioned at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah
Ha Mim Ain Qaf The speech about the disconnected letters was previously mentioned at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah
As Allah has sent down to you, O Prophet, this Qur’an, He sent down the Books and Scriptures to the Prophets before you, and He is the Exalted in His vengeance, the Wise in His words and deeds
To Allah alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and He is the Most High in His essence, power, and might, the Great, to whom belongs greatness and pride
The heavens almost split apart, one above the other, out of the greatness and majesty of the Most Gracious, Blessed and Exalted be He, and the angels glorify with praise their Lord and declare Him free from what is not befitting of Him, and they ask their Lord for forgiveness for the sins of those on the earth who believe in Him. Unquestionably, it is Allah who is the Forgiving of the sins of His believing servants, the Most Merciful to them
And those who have taken other than Allah as gods besides Him, taking them as guardians and worshipping them, Allah the Most High records their actions for them so that He may reward them for them on the Day of Resurrection. And you, O Messenger, are not the guardian over them in recording their actions. You are only a warner, so upon you is the message, and upon us is the reckoning."
m-0952	And as We revealed to the prophets before you, We revealed to you an Arabic Qur’an so that you may warn the people of Mecca and those around it from all the people and warn of the punishment of the Day of Assembly, which is the Day of Resurrection, there is no doubt about its coming. People will be divided into two groups: a group in Paradise, and they are those who believed in Allah and followed what His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, brought to them, and a group in the blazing Fire, and they are those who disbelieved in Allah and opposed what His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, brought to them. If Allah had willed to unite His creation upon guidance and make them upon one guided religion, He would have done so, but He wanted to include in His mercy whomever He willed from among His special creation. And the wrongdoers of themselves through polytheism will have no guardian to take care of their affairs on the Day of Resurrection, nor any helper to protect them from the punishment of Allah, the Most High. Rather, these polytheists have taken guardians besides Allah, who take care of them. Allah alone is the Guardian, and His servant takes care of Him through worship and obedience, and He takes care of His believing servants by bringing them out from darkness into light and helping them in all their affairs. He will revive the dead at the Resurrection, and He is Able to do all things. Nothing is beyond His power. You people differed about any matter of your religion, so the ruling on it is up to Allah in His Book and the Sunnah of His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. That is Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Upon Him alone I have relied in my affairs, and to Him I return in all my matters. Allah, the Most High, is the Creator of the heavens and the earth and their originator by His power, will, and wisdom. He made for you mates from among yourselves that you may find tranquility in them, and He made for you mates from among the livestock, males and females, multiplying you by means of procreation. Nothing of His creation resembles Him, nor is He comparable to Him, neither in His essence, nor in His names, nor in His attributes, nor in His actions, because all His names are good, and His attributes are attributes of perfection and greatness, and His actions, the Most High, created the great creations with Him without any partner, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. Nothing of the deeds and sayings of His creation is hidden from Him, and He will reward them for that. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and in His hand are the keys of mercy and provisions. He expands His provision for whomever He wills of His servants and restricts it for whomever He wills. Indeed, He, the Blessed and Exalted, is Knowing of all things. Nothing of His creation is hidden from Him.
m-0953	Allah has prescribed for you, O people, of the religion which We have revealed to you, O Messenger, which is Islam, what He commanded Noah to do and to convey, and what We commanded Abraham, Moses, and Jesus. These five are the resolute messengers, according to the well-known saying: Establish the religion with monotheism and obedience to Allah and worship Him alone, and do not differ in the religion which I have commanded you. It is difficult for the polytheists to call them to monotheism of Allah and to sincerely worship Him. Allah chooses for monotheism whomever He wills from among His creation, and guides to work in obedience to Him whoever returns to Him. And the polytheists did not divide in their religions and become sects and parties except after knowledge had come to them and the proof had been established against them. And nothing led them to that except transgression and stubbornness. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord, O Messenger, to delay the punishment from them until a specified term, which is the Day of Resurrection, it would have been decided between them to hasten the punishment of the disbelievers among them. And those who were given the Torah and the Gospel after these differing in the truth are in doubt about the religion and faith, falling into suspicion and blameworthy difference. So to that is the upright religion which Allah has prescribed for the prophets. And he enjoined upon them, “So call upon Allah’s servants, O Messenger, and be steadfast as Allah has commanded you, and do not follow the desires of those who doubted the truth and deviated from the religion, and say, ‘I have believed in all the books sent down from heaven to the prophets, and my Lord has commanded me to be just between you in judgment. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. For us is the reward for our good deeds, and for you is the recompense for your evil deeds. There is no dispute or argument between us and you after the truth has become clear. Allah will gather us and you on the Day of Resurrection and will judge between us with truth in that in which we differed. To Him is the return and the destination, and He will reward each according to what he deserves.”
m-0954	And those who dispute about the religion of Allah with which You have sent Muhammad (peace be upon him) after the people have responded to it and submitted - their argument and their argument are futile and worthless before their Lord, and upon them is wrath from Allah in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a severe punishment - the Fire. Allah is He who sent down the Qur’an and all the revealed books with the truth, and He sent down the Balance - which is justice - to judge between people with fairness. And what can make you know and teach you? Perhaps the Hour in which the Resurrection will take place is near. Those who do not believe in it hasten the coming of the Hour in mockery and derision, while those who believe in it are afraid of its coming and know that it is the truth about which there is no doubt. Unquestionably, those who dispute about the coming of the Hour are in error far from the truth. Allah is Kind to His servants. He expands provision for whom He wills and restricts it for whom He wills according to His wisdom. Glory be to Him. He is the Strong, to whom belongs all power. The Mighty in His vengeance on those who disobey Him.
m-0955	Whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter by his deeds, and fulfills the rights of Allah and spends in calling to the religion, We will increase for him his good deeds, multiplying for him ten times the reward of the good deed, or whatever increase Allah wills. But whoever desires the worldly life alone, We will give him from it what We have allotted for him, and he will have nothing of the reward in the Hereafter. Rather, are these polytheists partners in their polytheism and misguidance? They have innovated for themselves in religion and polytheism what Allah has not permitted. And were it not for the decree and predestination of Allah to grant them respite and not to hasten the punishment for them in this world, the judgment would have been passed between them to hasten the punishment for them. And indeed, for the disbelievers in Allah, on the Day of Resurrection, is a painful and grievous punishment. You will see, O Messenger, the disbelievers on the Day of Resurrection, fearing the punishment of Allah for what they earned in this world of evil deeds, and the punishment is coming down upon them, and they will taste it without a doubt. But those who believed in Allah and obeyed Him will be in the gardens of Paradise and its palaces and the delights of the Hereafter. They will have whatever their souls desire with their Lord. That is what Allah has given them of bounty and honor. It is the bounty that cannot be described and to which the minds cannot be guided.
m-0956	That which I have informed you of, O people, of bliss and honor in the Hereafter is the good news that Allah gives to His servants who believed in Him in this world and obeyed Him. Say, O Messenger, to those of the polytheists of your people who doubt the Hour, “I do not ask of you, for what I call you to of the truth with which I have come to you, any compensation for your wealth except that you love me in my kinship with you and maintain the ties of kinship that are between me and you. And whoever earns a good deed, We will multiply it for him by ten or more. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of the sins of His servants, Appreciative of their good deeds and their obedience to Him.” Rather, do these polytheists say, “Muhammad invented a lie against Allah and came with what he recites to us, inventing it from himself?” If Allah wills, He will seal your heart, O Messenger, if you did that. And Allah will remove falsehood and wipe it out and establish the truth with His words that do not change or alter and with His true promise that does not fail. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what is in the hearts of His servants. Nothing of it is hidden from Him. And Allah, the Most High, is the One Who accepts repentance from His servants if they return to the Oneness of Allah and His obedience. And He pardons misdeeds and knows whatever you do of good and evil. Nothing of that is hidden from Him, and He will reward you accordingly. And those who believe in God and His Messenger respond to their Lord when He calls them to it and submit to Him, and He increases them from His bounty in success and multiplication of reward and recompense. But those who disbelieve in God and His Messenger - for them on the Day of Resurrection is a severe, painful punishment.
m-0957	And if Allah were to expand the provision for His servants and make it abundant for them, they would transgress upon the earth with evil and insolence, and some of them would transgress against others. But Allah sends down their provisions in measure as He wills to suffice them. Indeed, He is aware of His servants of what is good for them, and is All-Seeing of their management and the direction of their affairs. And Allah alone is He who sends down rain from the sky and helps them with it after they have despaired of its descent, and He spreads His mercy among His creation, covering them with rain. He is the Guardian who takes care of His servants with His goodness and His praiseworthy grace in His guardianship and management. And among His signs that indicate His greatness, power and authority is the creation of the heavens and the earth without a previous example and what He spreads in them of various kinds of animals. And He is able to gather creation after their death for the place of Resurrection if He wills, and nothing is difficult for Him. And whatever befalls you, O people, of calamity in your religion and your worldly life is because of what you have earned of sins and crimes. And your Lord pardons you for many misdeeds, so He will not punish you for them. And you, O people, will not be able to frustrate the power of Allah over you, nor will you be able to escape Him, and you will have no protector besides Him. God is the guardian who takes care of your affairs and brings you benefits, and there is no helper who protects you from harm.
m-0958	"And among His signs that indicate His dazzling power and His overwhelming authority are the great ships like mountains that sail in the sea. If Allah wills, He who has made these ships sail in the sea, He will still the wind, so the ships remain stationary on the surface of the sea, not sailing. Indeed, in the sailing of these ships and their stopping in the sea by the power of Allah, there are clear lessons and arguments of Allah’s power for everyone who is patient in obeying Allah and grateful for His blessings and favors. Or He destroys the ships by drowning because of the sins of their people, and He pardons many sins, so He does not punish them for them. And He knows that those who dispute falsely about Our verses that indicate Our Oneness have no escape or refuge from the punishment of Allah when He punishes them for their sins. And their disbelief in Him
Whatever you have been given, O people, of wealth or children or anything else, is merely provision for you in the life of this world, and it quickly passes away. But what is with God Almighty of the eternal bliss of Paradise is better and more lasting for those who believe in God and His messengers and upon their Lord rely."
m-0959	"And those who avoid the major sins that Allah has forbidden and the obscene and ugly types of sins, and when they become angry with someone who wrongs them, they forgive the wrongdoing and overlook the punishment of the wrongdoer, seeking the reward and forgiveness of Allah Almighty. This is one of the good morals. And those who responded to their Lord when He called them to His Oneness and obedience, and established the obligatory prayers within their limits at their appointed times, and when they desire a matter, they consult one another about it, and from the wealth We have given them, they give charity in the cause of Allah, and fulfill the rights that Allah has imposed upon them for those who are entitled to it, such as zakat, maintenance, and other types of spending. And those who, when wrongdoing befalls them, take revenge on those who wrong them without transgressing. But if they are patient, then in the end of their patience is much good. And the recompense for the wrongdoer is his punishment with an evil like it, without increase. So whoever pardons the wrongdoer and leaves his punishment and restores friendship between him and the pardoned, seeking the countenance of Allah, then the reward for his pardon is that with Allah. Indeed, Allah does not like the wrongdoers who initiate aggression against people and wrong them. And whoever retaliates against him who has wronged him after he has wronged him - for those there is no blame.

The blame is only for those who transgress against people unjustly and aggressively and exceed the limit that their Lord has permitted them to do to that which He has not permitted them to do, and cause corruption in the land without right - for those on the Day of Resurrection is a painful and grievous punishment.

And for those who are patient in the face of harm and respond to offense with forgiveness, pardon, and concealment - indeed, that is from the determination of the praiseworthy matters and the praiseworthy deeds that God has commanded and has ordained for them a great reward and praiseworthy praise."
m-0960	And he whom Allah misguides from the right path because of his injustice, he will have no helper to guide him to the right path. And you will see, O Messenger, the disbelievers in Allah on the Day of Resurrection when they see the punishment, saying to their Lord, “Is there a way for us to return to the world so that we may work in obedience to You?” But they will not be answered. And you will see, O Messenger, these wrongdoers being presented to the Fire, submissive and humbled, looking at the Fire from a weak, humbled perspective out of fear and humiliation. And those who believed in Allah and His Messenger in Paradise will say when they saw what loss befell the disbelievers, “Indeed, the losers are those who have lost themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection by entering the Fire.” Unquestionably, the wrongdoers on the Day of Resurrection will be in a permanent torment that will not cease or go away. And when Allah punishes them on the Day of Resurrection, these disbelievers will have no helpers or supporters to protect them from the punishment of Allah. And he whom Allah misguides because of his disbelief and injustice, he will have no way to reach the truth in this world and to Paradise in the Hereafter, because the paths of salvation have been blocked for him. So guidance and misguidance are in His hand, glory be to Him, and no one else.
m-0961	Respond to your Lord, O disbelievers, with faith and obedience before the Day of Resurrection comes, which cannot be turned back. You will have no refuge that Day that will save you from the punishment, nor a place that will conceal you and in which you will hide. The verse is evidence of the condemnation of procrastination, and it includes the command to hasten to do every good deed that a servant is exposed to, for delay has its drawbacks and obstacles. If these polytheists turn away, O Messenger, from faith in Allah, then We have not sent you over them as a guardian of their deeds so that you may hold them accountable for them. You are only responsible for conveying the message. And indeed, when We give a person from Us mercy, such as wealth and abundance in money and other things, he rejoices and is happy. But if a calamity befalls them, such as poverty, sickness, and other things, because of what their hands have done of disobedience to Allah, then man is ungrateful, counting the calamities and forgetting the blessings. To Allah, the Most High, is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them. He creates what He wills of creation. He gives to whom He wills of His servants females, with no males with them, and He gives to whom He wills males, with no females with them. And He, the Most High, gives to whom He wills of people males and females, and He makes whom He wills To God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them. He creates whatever He wills of creation. He gives to whomever He wills of His servants females, with no males besides them, and He gives to whomever He wills males, with no females besides them. He, glory be to Him, gives to whomever He wills of mankind males and females, and He makes whomever He wills barren, with no children besides them. He is the Knower of what He creates, the Able to create whatever He wills. Nothing He wills to create is impossible for Him.
m-0962	It is not appropriate for a human being from among the children of Adam that Allah should speak to him except by revelation that Allah reveals to him, or that He should speak to him from behind a veil, as He spoke to Moses, peace be upon him, or that He should send a messenger, as Gabriel, peace be upon him, descended to the one to whom he was sent, and he reveals, by the permission of his Lord, not by mere desire, whatever Allah wills to reveal. He is exalted in His essence, names, attributes, and actions. He has subdued all things, and all creatures are subject to Him. He is Wise in managing the affairs of His creation. And in the verse is proof of the attribute of speech for Allah, the Most High, in the manner befitting His Majesty and Great Authority. And just as We revealed to the prophets before you, O Prophet, We have revealed to you a Qur’an from Us. You did not know before it what the previous scriptures were, nor what the faith was, nor what the divine laws were, but We have made the Qur’an a light for mankind, by which We guide whom We will of Our servants to the straight path. And indeed, O Messenger, you guide and show guidance, by Allah’s permission, to the straight path, which is Islam, the path of Allah, to whom belongs the dominion of all that is in the heavens and what is on the earth. He has no partner in that. Unquestionably, to Allah, O people, all your affairs, good and evil, will return. Then He will reward each according to his deeds. Indeed, Allah is Knowing, Knowing, Knowing. Good is good, and evil is evil. And just as We revealed to the prophets before you, O Prophet, We have revealed to you a Qur’an from Us. You did not know before it what the previous scriptures were, nor what faith was, nor what divine laws were. But We have made the Qur’an a light for mankind, guiding with it whom We will of Our servants to the straight path. And indeed, O Messenger, you guide and show guidance, by Allah’s permission, to the straight path, which is Islam, the path of Allah, to whom belongs the dominion of all that is in the heavens and on the earth. He has no partner in that. Unquestionably, to Allah, O people, all your affairs, good and evil, will return, and He will reward each one according to his deeds. If good, then good, and if evil, then evil.
m-0963	"Ha Mim, the disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah

Allah the Most High swore by the Qur’an, which is clear in wording and meaning

Indeed, We sent down the Qur’an to Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the Arabic language, so that you may understand and ponder its meanings and arguments. And indeed, it is in the Preserved Tablet with Us, exalted in its status and honor, decisive, with no difference or contradiction in it

And indeed, it is in the Preserved Tablet with Us, exalted in its status and honor, decisive, with no difference or contradiction in it

Should We turn away from you and abandon the revelation of the Qur’an to you because of your turning away, your lack of obedience, and your excessive disbelief in it?

Many of the prophets We sent in the early generations that passed before your people, O Prophet, and no prophet came to them except that they mocked him as your people mocked you. So We destroyed those who denied Our messengers, and they were stronger in strength and might than your people, O Muhammad. And the punishment of the former peoples was fulfilled by their being destroyed because of their disbelief And their tyranny and mockery of their prophets, and in this there is consolation for the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace

m-0964	And if you ask, O Messenger, these polytheists of your people, who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely say, “He created them.” The Almighty, in His dominion, is All-Knowing of them and of all things in them. Nothing is hidden from Him. He who made the earth a bed and a carpet for you, and made easy for you paths for your livelihood and your trade, so that you may be guided by those paths to your religious and worldly interests. And He who sent down rain from the sky in a measured amount, neither a flood that drowns nor one that falls short of need, so that it may be a livelihood for you and your livestock. So We revived with water a barren land of vegetation, just as We brought forth with this water that We sent down from the sky vegetation and crops from this dead land. You, O people, emerge from your graves after your annihilation. And He who created all kinds of animals and plants, and made for you ships that you ride in the sea, and beasts such as camels, horses, mules, and donkeys that you ride on land, so that you may mount on the backs of what you ride, then remember the favor of your Lord when you ride on it and say, “Praise be to God, who has subjected this to us, and we could not have done it.” And that you may also say, “And indeed, to our Lord, after our death, we will return.” This is a statement that God, who bestows various blessings upon His servants, is the One deserving of worship in every situation, so that you may mount on the backs of what you ride, then remember the favor of your Lord when you ride on it and say, “Praise be to God, who has subjected this to us, and we could not have endured it.” And so that you may also say, “And indeed, to our Lord, after our death, we will return.” This is a statement that God, who bestows various blessings upon His servants, is the One deserving of worship in every situation.
m-0965	"And these polytheists have given Allah a portion of His creation, and that is their saying to the angels, “The daughters of Allah.” Indeed, man is ungrateful for the blessings of his Lord which He has bestowed upon him, showing his ungratefulness and disbelief, enumerating the calamities and forgetting the blessings.

Rather, do you claim, O ignorant ones, that your Lord has taken daughters from what He creates, while you are not pleased with that for yourselves, and He has singled you out for sons, so He made them for you? And in this is a rebuke to them.

And when one of them is given the good news of a female, which he attributed to the Most Gracious, when he claimed that the angels are the daughters of Allah, his face becomes dark from the bad news of the female, and he is sad and filled with worry and distress. So how can they accept for Allah what they do not accept for themselves? Allah is exalted and sanctified far above what the disbelievers say.

Do you dare and attribute to Allah the Most Gracious one who is raised in adornment, while in argument he does not make his argument clear because of his femininity?

And these polytheists with Allah have made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Gracious, females. They brought up the state of their creation so that they would rule that they are females. Their testimony will be recorded and they will be asked about it in the Hereafter.

And these polytheists from Quraysh said, “If the Most Gracious had willed, we would not have worshipped Him.” No one besides Him, and this is a false argument, for Allah established the argument against the servants by sending the messengers and revealing the books, so their argument with fate and destiny is the most invalid of falsehoods after the messengers warned them. They have no knowledge of the truth of what they say about that, but they say it as a guess and a lie because they have no news from Allah about that or proof of it.

Did they bring the creation of the angels, or did We give them a book before the Qur’an that We revealed, so they cling to it, act according to what is in it, and argue with it against you, O Messenger?

Rather, they said, “Indeed, we found our fathers upon a way, a doctrine, and a religion, and we are following in the footsteps of our fathers in what they were upon, following them and imitating them.”
And likewise, We did not send before you, O Messenger, to any city any warner warning them of Our punishment for their disbelief in Us, so warn them and warn them of Our wrath and the arrival of Our punishment, except that those whom the blessing had made arrogant among the leaders and the great said, “Indeed, we found our fathers upon a religion and a way, and we are following their way and method.”
Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the messengers who preceded him said to those who opposed him with this false doubt Do you follow your fathers, even if I came to you from your Lord with a better guide to the path of truth and clearer indication of the path of right conduct than what you found your fathers following of religion and faith? They would say in stubbornness, ""Indeed, we, in that with which you have been sent, deny and disbelieve."" So We took revenge on these nations that denied Our messengers by inflicting upon them the punishment of sinking and drowning and other than that. So see, O Messenger, how was the end of their affair when they denied the signs of God and His messengers. And let your people beware lest they persist in their denial, lest the same as what befell them befall them."
m-0966	And remember, O Messenger, when Abraham said to his father and his people who worshipped what your people worshipped, “Indeed, I am disassociated from what you worship besides God. Except for He who created me, for He will guide me to follow the path of right guidance.” And Abraham, peace be upon him, made the word of monotheism, “There is no god but God,” remain in those after him, so that they might return to the obedience of their Lord and His oneness and repent from their disbelief and sins.
m-0967	"Rather, O Messenger, I have given enjoyment to these polytheists from your people and their fathers before them in life, so I did not hasten to punish them for their disbelief until the Qur’an and a Messenger came to them explaining to them what they need of the matters of their religion.

And when the Qur’an came to them from Allah, they said, “This that this Messenger has brought us is magic with which he bewitches us, and it is not a revelation from Allah, and indeed we deny it.”

And these polytheists from Quraysh said, “If this Qur’an is from Allah, then why was it not sent down to a great man from one of these two cities, Mecca or Ta’if?”

Do they divide up the prophethood and place it where they wish? We have divided among them their livelihood in their worldly life of provisions and sustenance, and have raised some of them above others in degrees. This one is rich and this one is poor and this one is strong and this one is weak, so that some of them may be subject to others in livelihood. And the mercy of your Lord, O Messenger, by admitting them to Paradise is better than what they accumulate of the perishable debris of this world.

And had it not been that mankind would have been one group in disbelief, We would have made for those who disbelieve in the Most Merciful roofs of silver for their houses and stairs upon which they ascend.

And We have made for their houses doors of silver and made for them couches upon which they recline. And We made for them gold. And all that is not but the enjoyment of worldly life, and it is a little, fleeting enjoyment. And the pleasure of the Hereafter is stored up with your Lord for the righteous, not for anyone else. And We made for their houses doors of silver, and We made for them couches on which to recline, and We made for them gold. And all that is not but the enjoyment of worldly life, and it is a little, fleeting enjoyment. And the pleasure of the Hereafter is stored up with your Lord for the righteous, not for anyone else."
m-0968	"And whoever turns away from the remembrance of the Most Gracious, which is the Qur’an, and does not fear His punishment and is not guided by His guidance, We appoint for him a devil in this world to mislead him as a reward for his turning away from the remembrance of Allah. He is his constant companion and friend, preventing him from what is lawful and sending him toward what is unlawful.

And indeed, the devils hinder from the path of truth those who turn away from the remembrance of Allah. They make misguidance seem attractive to them and make faith in Allah and working in obedience to Him hateful to them. And these people who turn away think, because the devils make their misguidance seem good to them, that they are on the truth and on the right path.

Until, when the one who turned away from the remembrance of the Most Gracious and his companion from the devils comes to Us for reckoning and recompense, the one who turned away from the remembrance of Allah will say to his companion, “I wish that between me and you was a distance like that between the east and the west. What an evil companion for me since you have led me astray.”

And it will not benefit you today, O you who turn away from the remembrance of Allah, since you associated others with Allah in this world, that you are partners in the punishment, you and your companions. So each one will have his greater share of the punishment, just as you participated in disbelief."
m-0969	"So, O Messenger, can you hear him whom Allah has made deaf from hearing the truth, or guide to the path of guidance him whose heart has been blinded from his sight, or guide him who is in clear error from the truth? That is not up to you. Your duty is only to convey the message, and it is not up to you to guide them, but Allah guides whom He wills and misguides whom He wills. If We take you, O Messenger, before your victory over the deniers among your people, then We will take retribution from them in the Hereafter, or We show you what We have promised them of the punishment that will descend upon them, like the day of Badr, then We are powerful over them. We will make you prevail over them and disgrace them with your hand and the hands of those who believe in you. So, O Messenger, hold fast to what Allah commands you in this Qur’an that He has revealed to you. Indeed, you are on a straight path. And that is the religion of Allah that He has commanded, and it is Islam and in this is confirmation of the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, and praise for him

And this Qur’an is an honor for you and your people from Quraysh, as it was revealed in their language, so they are the most knowledgeable people about it, so they should be the most upright people with it and the most effective in accordance with it. And you and those with you will be asked about thanking God for it and working with it.

And ask, O Messenger, the followers of those We sent before you from Our Messengers and the bearers of their laws, whose Messengers came with the worship of other than God, for they will tell you that this did not happen, for all the Messengers called to what you called people to, which is the worship of God alone, with no partner for Him, and they forbade the worship of anything other than God."
m-0970	"And We sent Moses with Our proofs to Pharaoh and the nobles of his people, just as We sent you, O Messenger, to these polytheists of your people. And Moses said to them, ""Indeed, I am the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds."" And when he came to them with the clear proofs indicating the truth of his call, behold, Pharaoh and his chiefs laughed at what Moses had brought them of signs and lessons. And We did not show Pharaoh and his chiefs any proof except that it was greater than the one before it and more indicative of the truth of what Moses was calling them to. And We seized them with various kinds of punishment, such as locusts, lice, frogs, the flood, and other things, so that they might return from their disbelief in Allah to His Oneness and obedience. And Pharaoh and his chiefs said to Moses, ""O scholar!"" And the magician was great among them, and they revered him. And magic was not a reprehensible attribute. Pray to your Lord for us, by His covenant which He has entrusted to you and with which He has distinguished you of virtues, to remove the torment from us. If He removes the torment from us, then we are guided and believe in what you have brought us.

So when Moses called for the torment to be lifted from them, and We lifted it from them, behold, they betrayed and persisted in their misguidance.

And Pharaoh called out to the leaders of his people, boasting and boasting about the kingdom of Egypt, “Is not the kingdom of Egypt mine, and these rivers flow beneath me? Do you not see my greatness and strength?” and the weakness and poverty of Moses.

Rather, I am better than this one who has no honor. He degrades himself in his needs due to his weakness and insignificance, and he can hardly articulate his speech due to his tongue. Pharaoh was driven to say this by disbelief, stubbornness, and turning away from the path of God.

Why was it not that Moses was given a bracelet of gold, if he was truthful that he was the Messenger of the Lord of the Worlds, or that the angels came with him, some of them coupled with others, and they followed one another, testifying to him that he was the Messenger of God to us?

So Pharaoh belittled the minds of his people and called them to misguidance, so they obeyed him and denied Moses. They were A people who were outside the obedience of God and His straight path. So when they angered Us by disobeying Us and denying Moses and the signs he brought, We took revenge on them with the immediate punishment that We hastened for them, so We drowned them all in the sea. So We made those whom We drowned in the sea a precedent for those who do the same as they did among those who come after them in deserving the punishment, and a lesson and admonition for others."
m-0971	"And when the polytheists used Jesus, son of Mary, as an example when they disputed with Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and argued with him about the Christians worshipping him, your people, because of that and because of it, rose up for them a clamor and uproar of joy and happiness. That was when the verse was revealed: “Indeed, you and what you worship besides God are fuel for Hell; you will be brought to it.” 2198 And the polytheists said: “We are pleased that our gods should be in the position of Jesus.” So God revealed the verse: “Indeed, those for whom good has preceded from Us - those will be removed from it.” 21101 So the one who is thrown into the Fire from the gods of the polytheists is he who is pleased with their worshipping him. And the polytheists of your people said: “O Messenger, are our gods whom we worship better or Jesus whom his people worship?” So if Jesus is in the Fire, then let us and our gods be with him. They did not give you this example except to argue. Rather, they are a people who dispute in falsehood. 

Jesus, son of Mary, was only a servant upon whom We bestowed prophethood and made him a sign and a lesson for the Children of Israel, by which they can prove Our power. 

And if We willed, We could have made in your place angels, some of whom would succeed others. Some instead of the sons of Adam
And the descent of Jesus, peace be upon him, before the Day of Resurrection is evidence of the nearness of the Hour, so do not doubt that it will inevitably happen, and follow what he has told you from God Almighty. This is a straight path to Paradise, with no crookedness in it

And do not let Satan turn you away with his whispers from obeying me in what I command you and forbid you from. Indeed, he is an enemy to you in open enmity
And when Jesus came to the Children of Israel with clear proofs, he said, “I have come to you with prophethood and to make clear to you some of the matters of religion in which you differ, so fear God by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, and obey what I have commanded you to do of fearing God and obeying Him
Indeed, God Almighty is my Lord and the Lord of all of you, so worship Him alone and do not associate anything with Him. This that I have commanded you to do of fearing God and singling Him out in divinity is the straight path and it is the true religion of God that is not accepted from anyone other than Him
So the groups differed regarding the matter of Jesus, peace be upon him, and they became sects, some of them acknowledge that he is the servant and messenger of God and he is the truth, and some of them claim that he is the son of God, and some of them say that he is God Almighty God is far above what they say. So destruction, devastation, and painful punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be for those who described Jesus with other than what God described him with. Are these parties who differ about Jesus, son of Mary, waiting for anything but the Hour to come to them suddenly while they do not feel or realize?"
m-0972	"Friends who commit sins against Allah in this world will disown each other on the Day of Resurrection, but those who have become friends out of fear of Allah, their friendship will be permanent in this world and the Hereafter.

It will be said to these pious people, “O My servants, you have no fear today of My punishment, nor will you grieve over what you have missed of the worldly fortunes.”

Those who believed in Our verses and acted upon what their messengers brought them, and were submissive to Allah, Lord of the worlds, with their hearts and limbs, it will be said to them, “Enter Paradise, you and your believing companions, enjoying life and being happy.”

Those who believed in Allah and His messengers will be served with food in vessels of gold and drink in cups of gold, and therein they will have whatever their souls desire and their eyes delight in, and they will remain therein forever.

This is the Paradise that Allah has given you because of what you used to do in this world. Good deeds and righteous actions, and He made them from His grace and mercy a reward for you. For you in Paradise there is abundant fruit of every kind, from which you eat."
m-0973	"Those who have committed sins through their disbelief will remain in the torment of Hell, and it will not be lightened for them, and they will despair therein of the mercy of Allah. And We have not wronged these criminals with the torment, but they were the wrongdoers themselves through their polytheism and their denial that Allah is the only true God, with no partner, and their failure to follow the messengers of their Lord. And those criminals will call out after Allah has put them in Hell, Malik, the keeper of Hell, “O Malik, let your Lord kill us so that we may be relieved of what we are in.” Malik answered them, ""You will remain, with no way out of it and no way out of it. We have brought you the truth and made it clear to you, but most of you are averse to what the messengers have brought of the truth."" And these criminals called out after Allah had cast them into Hell, Malik, the keeper of Hell, ""O Malik, let your Lord kill us so that we may be relieved of what we are in."" Malik answered them, ""You will remain, with no way out of it and no way out of it. We have brought you the truth and made it clear to you, but most of you are averse to what the messengers have brought of the truth."" 

Rather, have these polytheists decided on a matter by which they plot against the truth which We have brought them? We will surely manage for them what will recompense them of torment and punishment. 

Or do these polytheists think that We do not hear what they conceal within themselves and whisper among themselves? Yes, We hear and know, and Our messengers are the noble guardian angels. They record against them everything they do."
m-0974	"Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists of your people who claim that the angels are daughters of Allah, if the Most Gracious had a son as you claim, then I am the first to worship this son that you claim, but this did not happen and will not happen. So Allah is sanctified from having a wife or a son.

Pure and sanctified is He, the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Mighty Throne, from what they describe of lies and slander by attributing a son to Allah by the polytheists and other false claims that they make.

So leave, O Messenger, these slanderers against Allah to indulge in their falsehood and play in their worldly life until they meet their Day on which they are promised punishment, either in this world or in the Hereafter or in both.

And He is Allah alone, the One truly worshipped in the heavens and on the earth. He is the Wise, Who perfected His creation and perfected His law. He is the Knower of everything of the conditions of His creation. Nothing of it is hidden from Him.

And the blessings of Allah have multiplied, His goodness has increased, and His kingdom has become great. He alone has the authority of the seven heavens and the seven earths and everything between them. And with Him is knowledge of the Hour on which the Resurrection will take place and the creation will be gathered from their graves for the place of reckoning. And to Him you will be returned, O people, after your death, and He will reward each one according to what he deserves.

And those whom the polytheists worship do not possess the right to intercede with Him for anyone except for those who testify to the truth and acknowledge the Oneness of Allah and the Prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and they know the truth of what they have acknowledged and testified to.

And if you ask, O Messenger, these polytheists among your people, who created them, they will surely say, “Allah created us.” So how can they turn away and turn away from the worship of Allah and associate others with Him?

And Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, complained to his Lord about his people who denied him, “O Lord, these are a people who do not believe in You and in what You sent me with to them.”

So pardon them, O Messenger, and turn away from their harm, and do not issue from you anything but peace for them, which those with understanding and insight say to the ignorant, for they do not treat them foolishly nor do they treat them in the same way as their evil deeds. They will soon know what they will encounter of affliction and punishment. In this is a severe threat and warning to these stubborn disbelievers and their likes."

m-0976	"Rather, these polytheists are in doubt about the truth, so they are playing and fooling around and do not believe in it.

So wait, O Messenger, for these polytheists on the Day when the sky will bring a visible smoke that will engulf the people, and it will be said to them, “This is a painful and grievous punishment.” Then they will say, asking, “Our Lord, remove the punishment from us.” If You remove it from us, then we will be believers in You.

How can they remember and take heed after the punishment has descended upon them, when a clear Messenger came to them, namely Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, then they turned away from him and said, “A human being taught him.” The priests or the devils are crazy and not a messenger
How can they remember and learn a lesson after the punishment has descended upon them, and a clear messenger came to them, namely Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, then they turned away from him and said, “A human being taught him, or the priests or the devils, he is crazy and not a messenger”
We will lift the punishment from you for a little while, and you will see that you return to what you were in of disbelief, misguidance and denial, and that We will punish you for that
The day when We will punish all the disbelievers with the greatest punishment is the Day of Resurrection, which is the day of Our vengeance on them"
m-0977	"And We have already tested and tried before these polytheists the people of Pharaoh, and a noble Messenger came to them, namely Moses, peace be upon him, but they denied him and were destroyed. This is how We will deal with your enemies, O Messenger, if they do not believe. Moses said to them, “Submit to me the servants of Allah from among the Children of Israel and send them with me so that they may worship Allah alone, without partner. Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger in His revelation and His message. And do not be arrogant towards Allah by denying His messengers. Indeed, I come to you with a clear proof of the truth of my message. Indeed, I seek refuge in Allah, my Lord and your Lord, lest you kill me by stoning. And if you do not believe me in what I have brought to you, then leave me alone and refrain from harming me.” And do not be arrogant towards Allah by denying His messengers. Indeed, I come to you with a clear proof of the truth of my message. Indeed, I seek refuge in Allah, my Lord and your Lord, lest you kill me by stoning. And if you do not believe me in what I have brought to you, then leave me alone and refrain from harming me. My message is that I seek refuge in Allah, my Lord and your Lord, lest you kill me by stoning me. And if you do not believe me in what I have brought to you, then let me go and refrain from harming me.

So Moses called upon his Lord when Pharaoh and his people denied him and did not believe in him, saying, “Indeed, these are a people who associate others with Allah and are disbelievers.”

So, O Moses, travel by night with My servants who believed in you and believed in you and followed you, rather than those among them who denied you. Indeed, you will be pursued by Pharaoh and his soldiers, and you will be saved, while Pharaoh and his soldiers will be drowned.

And leave the sea as it was when you entered it, calm and not turbulent. Indeed, Pharaoh and his soldiers will be drowned in the sea.

How many gardens and lush gardens, flowing springs of water, crops, beautiful homes, and a life in which they were living in luxury and comfort did Pharaoh and his people leave after their destruction and Allah drowned them?

Such a punishment is the punishment of God for those who deny and exchange the favor of God for disbelief. And We caused those favors to be inherited after Pharaoh and his people by another people who succeeded them from the Children of Israel
So neither the heaven nor the earth wept in grief over Pharaoh and his people, nor were they spared from the punishment that befell them
And We had certainly saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating punishment for them by killing their sons and using their women
From Pharaoh, for he was a tyrant among the polytheists, excessive in his haughtiness and arrogance toward the servants of God
And We had certainly chosen the Children of Israel with knowledge of them over the people of their time
And We gave them miracles through the hand of Moses in which there was a trial and a test for them, ease and hardship"
m-0978	"These polytheists from your people, O Messenger, say, ""It is nothing but our death which we die, and it is the first and the last death. And after our death we will not be resurrected for the reckoning, reward, or punishment."" They also say, ""Then bring, O Muhammad, you and those with you, our fathers who have died, if you are truthful in that Allah raises those in the graves alive."" Are these polytheists better or the people of Tubba' al-Himyari and those before them of the nations who disbelieved in their Lord? We destroyed them for their crimes and disbelief. These polytheists are not better than those, so We will pardon them and not destroy them, and they are disbelievers in Allah. We did not create the heavens and the earth and between them in play. We did not create them except with the truth, which is the way of Allah in His creation and management. But most of these polytheists do not know that, and for this reason they did not reflect on them, because they do not hope for reward nor fear punishment. We created the heavens and the earth and between them is play. We did not create them except with the truth, which is the way of God in His creation and management. But most of these polytheists do not know that, so for this reason they did not reflect on them because they do not hope for reward nor fear punishment."
m-0979	"The Day of Judgment between the creation for what they have done in their worldly life of good or evil is their appointed time all together

A day when no companion will defend another from another, nor will they aid one another, except for those believers on whom Allah has mercy, for they may intercede for him with his Lord after Allah's permission. Indeed, Allah is the Exalted in His vengeance upon His enemies, the Merciful to His friends and those who obey Him

The tree of Zaqqum that emerges from the bottom of Hell, its fruit is food for the one who commits many sins, and the greatest of sins is associating partners with Allah

The tree of Zaqqum that emerges from the bottom of Hell, its fruit is food for the one who commits many sins, and the greatest of sins is associating partners with Allah

The fruit of the tree of Zaqqum is like molten metal, boiling in the bellies of the polytheists, like boiling water that has reached the utmost heat

The fruit of the tree of Zaqqum is like molten metal, boiling in the bellies of the polytheists Like boiling water that has reached the extreme heat
Take this sinful, wicked person and push him and drive him violently into the middle of Hell on the Day of Resurrection
Then pour over this sinful person’s head the water that has reached the extreme heat so that the torment will not leave him
It will be said to this sinful, wretched person, “Taste this torment with which you are being tormented today, for you are the honorable one among your people, the noble one over them.” In this is mockery and rebuke of him

Indeed, this torment with which you are being tormented today is the torment that you doubted in this world and were not certain of."
m-0980	"Those who fear Allah by obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions in this world will be in a place of residence, safe from calamities, sorrows, and other things.

In gardens and flowing springs.
They will wear the finest brocade and the coarse of it. They will face each other face to face, and they will not look at each other’s backs. They will sit around wherever they go.

Just as We have given these righteous people in the Hereafter honor by admitting them into the gardens and dressing them in them in fine silk and brocade, so have We honored them by marrying them to beautiful women with wide, beautiful eyes.

These righteous people in Paradise will seek every kind of fruit they desire, safe from that being cut off from them and its disappearance.

These righteous people in Paradise will not taste death after the first death they tasted in this world. And Allah has protected these righteous people from the torment of Hell, as a favor and kindness from Him, glory be to Him. This honor that We have given to the righteous people in the Hereafter is the great success after which there is no success. We have only made the wording and meaning of the Qur’an easy in your language, O Messenger, so that they may learn a lesson and be warned.

They will not taste These righteous people in Paradise will not taste death after the first death they tasted in this world, and Allah will protect these righteous people from the torment of Hell, as a favor and kindness from Him, glory be to Him. This which We have given to the righteous people in the Hereafter of honors is the great victory after which there is no victory. We have only made the wording and meaning of the Qur’an easy in your language, O Messenger, so that they may learn a lesson and be deterred. So wait, O Messenger, for what I have promised you of victory over these polytheists and what will befall them of punishment. They are awaiting your death and your subjugation. They will know for whom victory, triumph, and the supremacy of the word in this world and the Hereafter belong. It is for you, O Messenger, and for those who follow you from the believers."
m-0981	"Ha Mim, the disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah.

This Qur’an was sent down by Allah, the Almighty, in His vengeance against His enemies, the Wise in managing the affairs of His creation.

Indeed, in the seven heavens and the earth from which creation emerged, and in what is in them of creatures of different kinds and types, are proofs and arguments for those who believe in them.

And in your creation, O mankind, and in the creation of what is dispersed on the earth of creatures that creep upon it, are proofs and arguments for a people who are certain in Allah and His law.

And in the alternation of the night and the fire and their succession upon you, and in what Allah sent down from the sky of rain, thereby reviving the earth after its dryness, so it quivers with vegetation and crops, and in the direction of the winds for you from all sides and their direction for your benefit, are proofs and arguments for a people who understand. From Allah are His proofs and arguments.

We recite these verses and arguments to you, O Messenger, in truth. So in what discourse after Allah and His verses and His evidence that He is the True God, alone, with no partner, do they believe, acknowledge, and act?"
m-0982	"Severe destruction and devastation for every liar who commits many sins

He hears the verses of the Book of Allah being recited to him, then he persists in his disbelief, arrogant in himself about submitting to Allah and His Messenger, as if he did not hear what was recited to him of the verses of Allah. So, O Messenger, give this wicked liar good news of a painful and grievous torment in the fire of Hell on the Day of Resurrection

And if this wicked liar learns anything of Our verses, he takes them in ridicule and mockery. Those will have a torment that will humiliate and disgrace them on the Day of Resurrection as a recompense for their mockery of the Qur’an

In front of these mockers of the verses of Allah is Hell, and what they have earned will not avail them at all, of wealth and children, nor their gods which they worshipped besides Allah. And for them is a great and painful torment

This Qur’an which We have revealed to you, O Messenger, is guidance from misguidance and evidence of the truth. It guides to the straight path whoever follows it and acts upon it. But those who deny what is in the Qur’an of verses indicating the truth and do not believe in them, for them is a torment of the worst kinds of torment on the Day of Resurrection, painful and grievous"
m-0983	Allah, the Almighty, is the One Who has subjected the sea to you so that ships may sail therein by His command and that you may seek from His bounty various types of trade and earnings. Perhaps you will thank your Lord for subjecting it to you, so worship Him alone and obey Him in what He commands you and forbids you. And He has subjected to you everything in the heavens of the sun, moon, and stars, and everything on the earth of animals, trees, ships, and other things, for your benefit. All of these blessings are a favor from Allah alone that He has bestowed upon you and a favor from Him that He has bestowed, so worship Him alone and do not make a partner for Him. Indeed, in what Allah has subjected to you are signs and indications of the Oneness of Allah for a people who reflect on the verses of Allah, His proofs, and His evidence, and learn from them.
m-0984	Say, O Messenger, to those who believe in Allah and follow His messengers, pardon and overlook those who do not expect the reward of Allah nor fear His punishment when they harm those who believe, so that Allah may recompense these polytheists for what they earned in this world of sins and harm to the believers. Whoever among the servants of Allah acts in obedience to Him, then it is for his own soul that he has committed evil. Then, O people, you will return to your Lord after your death, so He will recompense the doer of good for his good and the doer of evil for his evil.
m-0985	And We gave the Children of Israel the Torah and the Gospel and the wisdom contained in them, and We made most of the prophets from the descendants of Abraham, peace be upon him, among them, and We provided for them of the good things of sustenance, fruits, and foods, and We preferred them over the people of their time. And We gave the Children of Israel clear laws regarding what is lawful and what is unlawful, and evidence that distinguishes truth from falsehood. They did not differ except after knowledge had come to them and the proof had been established against them. And what drove them to do that was the transgression of some of them against others, seeking elevation and leadership. Indeed, your Lord, O Messenger, will judge between the differing ones among the Children of Israel on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they differed in the world. And in this is a warning to this nation not to follow their path. Then We made you, O Messenger, on a clear path in the matter of religion, so follow the law that We made you upon and do not follow the desires of the ignorant of the law of Allah who do not know the truth. And in this verse is a great indication of the perfection of this religion and its honor and the necessity of submitting to its rule and not leaning towards the desires of the disbelievers and atheists. Indeed, these polytheists with their Lord who call you to follow their desires will not benefit you, O Messenger, from The punishment of Allah is something if you follow their desires. And indeed, the wrongdoers who transgress the limits of Allah, among the hypocrites, the Jews, and others, are supporters of one another against the believers in Allah and the people of obedience to Him. And Allah is the supporter of those who fear their Lord by performing His obligations and avoiding His prohibitions. This Qur’an which We have revealed to you, O Messenger, is insight by which people may see the truth from falsehood and know the path of right guidance, and guidance and mercy for a people who are certain of the truth of its authenticity and that it is a revelation from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise.
m-0986	Rather, I think that those who have earned evil deeds and denied the messengers of Allah and disobeyed the command of their Lord and worshipped other than Him, that We should make them like those who believed in Allah and believed in His messengers and did righteous deeds and were sincere in worshiping Him alone and that We should make them equal to them in this world and the Hereafter. Evil is their judgment of making the wicked equal to the righteous in the Hereafter. And Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth, justice, and wisdom, so that every soul may be rewarded in the Hereafter for what it has earned of good or evil, and they will not be wronged in recompense for their deeds.
m-0987	Have you seen, O Messenger, one who takes his own desires as his god, so he desires nothing but that he does it, and Allah has sent him astray after knowledge has reached him and the proof has been established against him, so he does not hear the admonitions of Allah nor consider them, and a seal has been placed upon his heart so that he does not understand anything by it, and a veil has been placed over his sight so that he does not see the proofs of Allah by it, so who will guide him to the truth and the right path after Allah has sent him astray? Will you not remember, O people, and learn that whoever Allah does that to will never be guided and will not find for himself a guardian to guide him? The verse is the basis for warning against desire being the motivation of believers in their deeds. And these polytheists say, “There is no life except our worldly life in which we are, there is no life other than it,” denying the resurrection after death, “And nothing destroys us except the passing of nights and days and the length of life,” denying that they have a Lord who would annihilate them and destroy them. And these polytheists have no knowledge of that. They only speak by conjecture, illusion, and imagination. When Our clear verses are recited to these polytheists who deny the resurrection, they will have no argument except their saying to the Messenger Muhammad, “You are alive.” And the believers with you are our fathers who have perished, if you are truthful in what you say. Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists who deny the resurrection: God Almighty gives you life in this world as long as He wills for you, then He causes you to die therein, then He will gather you all alive until the Day of Resurrection. There is no doubt about that, but most people do not know God’s ability to cause them to die and then resurrect them on the Day of Resurrection.
m-0988	"To Allah belongs the dominion of the seven heavens and the earth in creation, dominion and servitude. And on the Day the Hour comes when the dead will be raised from their graves and brought to account, the disbelievers in Allah, who deny what He sent down to His Messenger of clear signs and evident proofs, will lose. And you will see, O Messenger, on the Day the Hour will come, the people of every nation and religion kneeling on their knees, every nation called to the book of its deeds and it will be said to them, “Today you will be recompensed for what you used to do of good or evil.” This is Our Book that speaks against you of all your deeds without addition or reduction. Indeed, We used to command the guardians to record your deeds against you. As for those who believed in Allah and His Messenger in this world and obeyed His commands and avoided His prohibitions, their Lord will admit them into His Paradise by His mercy. That entry is the clear success after which there is no success. As for those who denied that Allah is the true God and denied His Messengers and did not act according to His law, it will be said to them, as a rebuke and a rebuke, “Were not My verses recited to you in this world, and you were too arrogant to listen to them and believe in them.” And you were a people who committed sins and did not believe in reward or punishment.

And when it is said to you, “The promise of Allah to raise people from their graves is true and the Hour is without doubt,” you say, “We do not know what the Hour is, and we do not expect it to happen except in imagination, and we are not certain that the Hour is coming.”

And it will become clear to those who used to deny the signs of Allah what they did in this world of ugly deeds and what came down upon them from the punishment of Allah as a recompense for what they used to mock.

And it will be said to these disbelievers, “Today we will leave you in the punishment of Hell just as you abandoned faith in your Lord and working to meet this Day of yours, and your dwelling place is the fire of Hell, and you will have no helpers to protect you from the punishment of Allah.”

This punishment that has befallen you is because you took the signs of Allah and His proofs as a joke and a game, and the adornments of the worldly life deceived you. So today they will not come out of the Fire, nor will they be returned to the world to repent and do righteous deeds."
m-0989	To God Almighty alone is praise for His countless blessings upon His creation, Lord of the heavens and the earth, their Creator and Manager, Lord of all creation. To Him alone, glory be to Him, is greatness, majesty, pride, authority, power, and perfection in the heavens and the earth. He is the Almighty who cannot be overcome, the Wise in His words, actions, power, and law. Exalted and sanctified is He, there is no god but Him.
m-0990	"Ha Mim. The disjointed letters were previously discussed at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah.

This Qur’an is a revelation from Allah, the Almighty, Who cannot be overcome by the Wise in His management and creation.

We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth, not in vain nor in vain, but so that the servants may know the greatness of their Creator, so that they may worship Him alone and know that He is able to restore the servants after their death and that they may establish truth and justice among themselves and for a term known to Him. And those who deny that Allah is the true God turn away from what the Qur’an has warned them of, not admonished nor reflecting.

Say, O Messenger, to these disbelievers, “Have you seen the gods and idols that you worship besides Allah? Show me what they have created on the earth, or do they have a share with Allah in the creation of the heavens? Bring me a book from Allah before this Qur’an or a remainder of knowledge, if you are truthful in what you claim.

No one is more astray and ignorant than he who calls upon gods besides Allah who never answer his call because they are dead or stones or trees and the like, and they are unaware of the call of those who worship them, unable to benefit or harm them."
m-0991	And when people are gathered on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning and recompense, the gods they called upon in this world will be their enemies, cursing them, disowning them, and denying their knowledge of their worship of them. And when Our verses are recited to these polytheists, clear, those who disbelieve say when the Qur’an comes to them, “This is apparent magic.” Rather, do these polytheists say that Muhammad has fabricated this Qur’an? Say to them, O Messenger, “If I have fabricated it against Allah, then you will not be able to avert from me anything of the punishment of Allah if He punishes me for that. He, glory be to Him, knows better than anything else what you say about this Qur’an. Sufficient is Allah as a witness against me and against you. And He is the Forgiving of those who repent to Him, the Merciful to His believing servants.”
m-0992	Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists of your people, “I was not the first of Allah’s messengers to His creation, and I do not know what Allah will do with me or with you in this world. I follow nothing in what I command you and in what I do except the revelation of Allah which He reveals to me. I am only a warner clear of warning.” Say, O Messenger, to the polytheists of your people, “Tell me if this Qur’an is from Allah and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from the Children of Israel, such as Abdullah bin Salam, testifies to something like this Qur’an, which is what is in the Torah about believing in the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he believed and acted upon what came in the Qur’an, and you denied that out of arrogance. Is this anything but the greatest injustice and the most severe disbelief? Indeed, Allah does not guide to Islam and the attainment of the truth those people who wronged themselves by their disbelief in Allah. Those who denied the prophethood of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said to those who believed in him, “If your belief in Muhammad for what he brought had been good, you would not have preceded us in believing in him.” And since they were not guided by the Qur’an and did not benefit from what is in it of truth, they will say, “This is a lie transmitted from the people of old.” And before this Qur’an, We sent down the Torah as a guide. For the Children of Israel to follow its example, and a mercy for those who believe in it and act according to what is in it. And this Qur’an confirms what came before it of the Scriptures. We have sent it down in the Arabic tongue to warn those who wronged themselves by disbelief and disobedience, and as good tidings for those who obeyed Allah and did good in their faith and obedience in this world. Indeed, those who say, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remain steadfast in faith in Him, there will be no fear concerning them of the terror of the Day of Resurrection and its horrors, nor will they grieve over what they left behind after their death of worldly possessions. Those are the people of Paradise, abiding therein forever by the mercy of Allah Almighty for them and for what they put forth of righteous deeds in their world.
m-0993	And We have enjoined upon man to treat his parents well, to be dutiful to them during their life and after their death. His mother carried him as a fetus in her womb with difficulty and fatigue, and she gave birth to him with difficulty and fatigue as well. The period of his pregnancy and weaning is thirty months. In mentioning these hardships that the mother endures without the father, there is evidence that her right over her child is greater than the right of the father. Until when this man reaches the end of his physical and mental strength and reaches forty years of age, he calls upon his Lord, saying: “My Lord, inspire me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and make me do righteousness that pleases You, and make righteous for me my offspring. Indeed, I repent to You from my sins, and indeed, I am among those who submit to You in obedience, and surrender to Your command and prohibition, and are obedient to Your judgment.” Those are the ones from whom We accept the best of what they have done of righteous deeds and pardon their misdeeds, among the companions of Paradise. This is the promise that We have promised them, the promise of truth, about which there is no doubt. And he said to his parents when they called him to believe in God and to acknowledge the resurrection: “Ugly is that you promise me that I will come out of my grave alive, while my days have passed.” Generations of nations before me perished, and none of them was resurrected. His parents asked God for his guidance, saying to him, “Woe to you! Believe and be truthful and do righteousness. Indeed, the promise of God of resurrection is true, without doubt.” He said to them, “What you are saying is nothing but what the ancients wrote of falsehoods, taken from their books.” Those who are like this, God’s punishment is due to them, and His punishment and wrath have descended upon them, along with nations that passed before them from among the jinn and mankind, in disbelief and denial. Indeed, they were losers, because they traded guidance for misguidance and comfort for punishment.
m-0994	And every group of good and evil people will have a station with Allah on the Day of Judgment, according to the deeds they did in this world, each according to his rank. And Allah will fully recompense them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged by an increase in their bad deeds or a decrease in their good deeds. And on the Day those who disbelieved will be exposed to the Fire for punishment, and it will be said to them, as a rebuke, “You squandered your good things in your worldly life and enjoyed them. So today, O disbelievers, you will be recompensed with the punishment of disgrace and humiliation in the Fire because you were arrogant on the earth without right and because you were rebelling against the obedience of Allah.”
m-0995	And remember, O Messenger, the Prophet of God, Hud, the brother of Aad in lineage but not in religion, when he warned his people that God’s punishment would befall them while they were in their homes known as Al-Ahqaf, which are the many sands in the south of the Arabian Peninsula. The messengers had warned their people before and after Hud not to associate anything with God in your worship of Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of God on a Day whose terror will be great, which is the Day of Resurrection. They said, “Have you come to us with your invitation to turn us away from the worship of our gods? Then bring us what you threaten us with of punishment, if you are of the people of truth in your word and promise.” Hud, peace be upon him, said, “The knowledge of the time of the coming of what you have been promised of punishment is with God, and I am only the Messenger of God to you, conveying to you what He has sent me with, but I see that you are a people who are ignorant in your hastening of punishment and your audacity towards God.” So when they saw the punishment that they had hastened appearing in the sky heading towards their valleys, they said, “This is a rain cloud for us.” Hud, peace be upon him, said to them, “It is not a rain cloud and mercy as you thought, but rather it is a punishment cloud that You hastened it, for it is a wind in which is a painful and grievous torment. It destroys everything it passes through, which it sent to destroy by the command and will of its Lord, so that nothing can be seen in their land except the dwellings in which they used to live. Such is the recompense We recompense the criminal people for their crime and their transgression.
m-0996	And We had facilitated for the people of Aad the means of empowerment in this world in a way that We had not empowered you, the disbelievers of Quraysh. And We gave them hearing by which they could hear, sight by which they could see, and hearts by which they could understand. But they used them in a way that angered Allah with them, but they did not avail them at all, since they denied the proofs of Allah. And the punishment that they ridiculed and hastened descended upon them. This is a threat from Allah, the Almighty, and a warning to the disbelievers. And We had destroyed the towns around you, O people of Mecca, such as Aad and Thamud. And We made them desolate on their roofs. And We made clear to them various proofs and evidences, so that they might return from their disbelief in Allah and His signs. Why did We not support those of the past nations whom We had destroyed, whose worship they had taken as an offering, drawing near to their Lord, so that they might intercede for them with Him? Rather, their gods had gone astray from them, so they did not answer them nor defend them. That was their lie and what they were fabricating in their taking them as gods.
m-0997	And remember, O Messenger, when We sent to you a group of jinn listening to you the Qur’an. So when they were present and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was reciting, some of them said to one another, “Listen, so that we may listen to the Qur’an.” So when the Messenger finished reciting the Qur’an and they had understood it and it had made an impact on them, they returned to their people, warning and admonishing them of the punishment of Allah if they did not believe in it. They said, “O our people, indeed we have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming what came before it of the Books of Allah which He revealed to His Messengers, guiding to the truth and righteousness and to a correct and straight path.” O our people, respond to the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, to what he calls you to, and believe in him and act according to what he has brought you. Allah will forgive you some of your sins and save you from a painful and grievous punishment. And whoever does not respond to the Messenger of Allah to what he calls to, he cannot escape Allah on earth when He intends to punish him, and he has no helpers besides Allah to protect him from His punishment. Those are in clear deviation from the truth.
m-0998	They neglected and did not know that God, who created the heavens and the earth without a previous example and was not unable to create them, is able to revive the dead whom He created first. Indeed, that is an easy matter for God Almighty, for whom nothing is impossible. Indeed, He is over all things competent. And on the Day of Resurrection, those who disbelieved will be exposed to the fire of Hell for punishment. It will be said to them, “Is this punishment not in truth?” They will respond, “Yes, and our Lord is the truth.” It will be said to them, “Then taste the punishment for what you used to deny and reject in this world the punishment of the Fire.” So be patient, O Messenger, with what has befallen you from the harm of your people who denied you, just as the resolute messengers before you were patient, and they are the famous ones, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and you are one of them. And do not hasten the punishment for your people, for when it occurs and they see it, it will be as if they had not remained in this world except for an hour of a day. This is a message to them and others, and no one will perish by the punishment of God except the people who went against His command and obedience.
m-0999	"Those who denied that Allah is the only true God, with no partner, and prevented people from His religion, Allah will make their deeds null and void and make them miserable because of them.

And those who believed in Allah and followed His law and believed in the Book that was sent down to Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which is the truth about which there is no doubt from their Lord, He will pardon them and conceal for them what they did of evil deeds, so He did not punish them for them, and He will set right their condition in this world and the Hereafter.

That misguidance and guidance is caused by the fact that those who disbelieved followed Satan and obeyed him, and those who believed followed the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and what he brought of light and guidance, as Allah, the Most High, explained His action with the two groups, the disbelievers and the believers, with what they deserve. He, the Most High, sets forth examples for people, so He will assign to each people examples and forms that are appropriate.

So when you, O believers, meet those who disbelieve in the battlefields, then fight them and strike their necks until you have weakened them by killing them and breaking their strength, then tighten the chains of the prisoners, and either grant them a favor by releasing them without compensation or they ransom themselves with money. Or something else, and either they are enslaved or killed, and they continue in that until the war ends. That is the ruling mentioned in the trial of the believers by the disbelievers and the alternation of days between them. If Allah had willed, He could have given victory to the believers over the disbelievers without fighting, but He made their punishment at your hands. So He prescribed jihad to test you through them and to make His religion victorious through you. And those who are killed in the way of Allah from the believers, Allah will not invalidate the reward of their deeds. He will guide them during their lives in this world to obey Him and please Him, and He will improve their condition, affairs, and reward in this world and the Hereafter, and He will admit them to Paradise. He will make them know it and describe it to them, and guide them to do what He has commanded them to do, including martyrdom in His way. Then He will make them know when they enter Paradise their dwellings in it. So when you, O believers, meet those who disbelieve in the battlefields, then fight them and strike their necks until you have weakened them by the great number of killings and broken their strength, then tighten the chains of the prisoners, and either you grant them a favor by releasing them without compensation, or they ransom themselves with money or something else, or they are enslaved or killed, and they continue in that until the war ends. That is the ruling mentioned. In testing the believers with the disbelievers and alternating days between them, and if Allah had willed, He could have given victory to the believers over the disbelievers without fighting, but He made their punishment at your hands, so He prescribed jihad to test you through them and to support His religion through you.

Then He will make them know when they enter Paradise their dwellings in it.

This is the ruling mentioned in testing the believers with the disbelievers and alternating days between them. And if Allah had willed, He would have given victory to the believers.

Then He will make them know, when they enter Paradise, their homes in it."
m-1000	"O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His Law, if you support the religion of Allah by striving in His cause, ruling by His Book, obeying His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, Allah will give you victory over your enemies and make your feet firm in battle.

And those who disbelieved - that is their destruction, and Allah will take away the reward of their deeds. That is because they hated the Book of Allah revealed to His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, so they denied it, so He invalidated their deeds because they were in obedience to Satan.

Have these disbelievers not traveled in Allah's land, taking heed of the punishment that befell the nations who denied before them? Allah destroyed their homes, and the disbelievers will have a similar end that befell those nations.

That which We did to the two groups, the group of faith and the group of disbelief, is because Allah is the ally and supporter of the believers, and the disbelievers have no ally or supporter."
m-1001	Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe in Allah and His Messenger and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow, as an honor for them. And the example of those who disbelieve in their eating and enjoying this world is like that of livestock, whose only concern is to eat and nothing else. And the fire of Hell is their dwelling and shelter. And many of the people of towns were stronger in strength than the people of your town, O Messenger, and it is Mecca which expelled you. We destroyed them with various kinds of torment, so there was for them no helper to protect them from the torment of Allah. Is one who has a clear proof from his Lord and knowledge of His Oneness like one who has made Satan’s evil deeds seem good to him and follows what his soul calls him to of disobeying Allah and worshipping other than Him without proof or evidence? They are not equal. The description of Paradise that Allah has promised to the righteous: In it are great rivers of water that never changes, and rivers of milk whose taste never changes, and rivers of wine with which the drinkers enjoy, and rivers of honey purified from impurity. And for these righteous people in this Paradise are all kinds of fruits, and greater than that is concealment and overlooking. Their sins. Is the one who is in this Paradise like the one who is staying in the Fire and will not come out of it? And they were given to drink water that was so hot that it tore up their intestines.
m-1002	"Among these hypocrites are those who listen to you, O Prophet, without understanding, out of negligence and contempt, until when they leave your gathering, they say to those who attended your gathering from the people of knowledge of the Book of Allah, by way of mockery, “What did Muhammad say now?” Those are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed, so they do not understand the truth nor are they guided to it, and they follow their desires in disbelief and misguidance.

And those who were guided to follow the truth, Allah increased their guidance, so He strengthened their guidance and granted them success in piety and made it easy for them.

These deniers are waiting for nothing but the Hour that they were promised to come to them suddenly, for its signs have appeared and they have not benefited from that, so how can they remember when the Hour comes to them?

So know, O Prophet, that there is no true deity except Allah, and seek forgiveness for your sin and seek forgiveness for the believing men and believing women, and Allah knows your behavior during your wakefulness during the day and your rest during your sleep at night."
m-1003	"And those who believe in Allah and His Messenger say, ""Why has not a surah been revealed from Allah commanding us to wage jihad against the disbelievers?"" So when a surah is revealed that is clear and contains obligations and jihad, you will see those in whose hearts is doubt about the religion of Allah and hypocrisy looking at you, O Prophet, with the look of one who has fainted from fear of death. So it is more appropriate for those in whose hearts is disease to obey Allah and to say words that are in accordance with the Shari'ah. So when fighting becomes obligatory and the command of Allah comes to impose it, these hypocrites will hate that. If they were to be truthful to Allah in faith and action, it would be better for them than disobedience and opposition. And those who believe in Allah and His Messenger say, ""Why has not a surah been revealed from Allah commanding us to wage jihad against the disbelievers?"" So when a surah is revealed that is clear and contains obligations and jihad, you will see those in whose hearts is doubt about the religion of Allah and hypocrisy looking at you, O Prophet, with the look of one who has fainted from fear of death. So it is more appropriate for those in whose hearts is disease to obey Allah and to say words that are in accordance with the Shari'ah. So when fighting becomes obligatory and the command of Allah comes to impose it, these hypocrites will hate that. So if they were to be truthful to Allah in faith and action, it would be better for them than disobedience and opposition. Disobedience and transgression
Perhaps if you turn away from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, you will disobey Allah on earth, disbelieve in Him, shed blood, and sever your ties of kinship
Those are the ones whom Allah has distanced from His mercy, making them unable to hear or see what benefits them, so they do not understand Allah’s proofs despite their abundance
Do these hypocrites not ponder the admonitions of the Qur’an and reflect on its proofs? Rather, these hearts are closed, and nothing of this Qur’an reaches them, so they do not ponder Allah’s admonitions and lessons"
m-1004	Those who turned back from guidance and faith and turned back in disbelief in Allah after the truth had become clear to them - Satan made their sins pleasing to them and extended hope to them. This support was given to them so that they would persist in disbelief because they said to the Jews who hated what Allah had revealed, “We will obey you in some of the matter,” which is contrary to the command of Allah and the command of His Messenger. Allah knows what these people conceal and conceal. So let the Muslim beware of obeying anyone other than Allah in what contradicts the command of Allah, the Most High, and the command of His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. So how will they be when the angels seize their souls while they are striking their faces and backs? This is the torment they deserved and received because they followed what angered Allah with them in obeying Satan and hated what pleased Him from them in righteous deeds, including fighting the disbelievers after He had made it obligatory for them. So Allah nullified the reward for their deeds of charity, maintaining family ties, and other things. Rather, the hypocrites think that Allah will not remove what is in their hearts of envy and hatred for Islam and its people. Yes, Allah distinguishes the truthful from the liar.
m-1005	And if We willed, O Prophet, We could show you their persons, and you would recognize them by their apparent signs, and you would recognize them by what appears in their speech that indicates their intentions. And Allah, the Most High, does not hide from Him the deeds of those who obey Him or the deeds of those who disobey Him, and He will reward each according to what he deserves. And We will test you, O believers, by fighting and striving against the enemies of Allah until what He, the Most High, knew from eternity becomes apparent, so that We may distinguish among you the people of striving and patience in fighting the enemies of Allah, and We will test your words and actions, so that the truthful among you may appear from the liar. Indeed, those who denied that Allah is the only true God, with no partner, and turned people away from His religion, and opposed the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and fought him after the proofs and signs had come to them, that he was a prophet from Allah, will never harm the religion of Allah at all, and the reward for the deeds they did in this world will be nullified because they did not seek the pleasure of Allah, the Most High.
m-1006	"O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, obey Allah and obey the Messenger in their commands and prohibitions and do not invalidate the reward of your deeds through disbelief and sins. Those who denied that Allah is the only true God, with no partner for Him, and prevented people from His religion, and then died upon that, Allah will never forgive them and will punish them for their disbelief and disgrace them before all witnesses. So do not be weak, O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger, in jihad against the polytheists and be cowardly in fighting them and calling them to peace and reconciliation while you are the ones who have power over them and are superior to them. Allah is with you with His victory and support. In that is great glad tidings of victory and triumph over the enemies, and Allah will not diminish the reward of your deeds. The life of this world is only play and delusion. If you believe in Allah and His Messenger and fear Allah by performing His obligations and avoiding His sins, He will give you the reward of your deeds and will not ask you to give out all of your wealth in zakat. Rather, He will ask you to give out some of it. If He asks you for your wealth and insists upon you and exerts you, you will be stingy with it and withhold it from Him. And the hatred in your hearts will be revealed when you are asked to give what you hate.

The life of this world is only play and delusion. If you believe in Allah and His Messenger and fear Allah by performing His obligations and avoiding His disobedience, He will give you the reward for your deeds. He will not ask you to give all of your wealth in zakat, but rather He will ask you to give some of it. If He asks you for your wealth and insists upon you and exerts you, you will be stingy with it and withhold it from Him. And the hatred in your hearts will be revealed when you are asked to give what you hate.

Here you are, O believers, being called to spend in jihad against the enemies of Allah and in support of His religion. Some of you are stingy with spending in the cause of Allah. And whoever is stingy is only stingy with himself. And Allah is the One who is independent of you, while you are the ones in need of Him. But if you turn away from believing in Allah and obeying His command, He will destroy you and bring forth another people who will not be like you in turning away from the command of Allah, but they will obey Him and obey His Messenger and strive in His cause with their wealth and their lives."
m-1007	Verily, We have granted you, O Messenger, a clear conquest in which Allah will make your religion manifest and grant you victory over your enemy. It is the truce of Hudaybiyyah, because of which people felt safe with one another, and the circle of calling to the religion of Allah expanded, and whoever wanted to know the truth of Islam was able to know it. So people entered the religion of Allah in droves during that period. Therefore, Allah called it a clear conquest, meaning apparent and evident. We granted you that conquest and made it easy for you so that Allah may forgive you your past and future sins because of the many acts of obedience that occurred in this conquest and the hardships that you endured, and complete His favor upon you by making your religion manifest and granting you victory over your enemies, and guide you to a straight path of religion in which there is no crookedness, and Allah may grant you a strong victory in which Islam will not be weakened. We granted you that conquest and made it easy for you so that Allah may forgive you your past and future sins because of the many acts of obedience that occurred in this conquest and the hardships that you endured, and complete His favor upon you by making your religion manifest and granting you victory over your enemies, and guide you to a straight path of religion in which there is no crookedness, and Allah may grant you a strong victory in which Islam will not be weakened. Allah is the One Who sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers in Allah and His Messenger on the day of Al-Hudaybiyah, so that they were calmed and certainty was established in them so that they would increase in belief in Allah and in following His Messenger along with their belief in and following of Him. And Allah, glory be to Him, has the soldiers of the heavens and the earth through whom He supports His believing servants. And Allah is All-Knowing of the interests of His creation, Wise in His management and creation.
m-1008	That Allah may admit the believing men and believing women to gardens beneath whose trees and palaces rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. And He will erase from them the evil of what they did, so He will not punish them for it. And that is the reward with Allah, salvation from every grief and attainment of every desire. And Allah will punish the hypocrites, men and hypocrites, and the polytheists, men and polytheists, who think evil of Allah that He will not support His Prophet and the believers with him against their enemies and will not make His religion prevail. So upon these people revolves the circle of punishment and everything that will harm them, and Allah’s wrath upon them and His expulsion from His mercy and prepared for them the fire of Hell. And evil is the home to which they will end. And Allah, glory be to Him, has the soldiers of the heavens and the earth, with whom He supports His believing servants. And Allah is Exalted in Might over His creation, Wise in managing their affairs.
m-1009	Indeed, We have sent you, O Messenger, as a witness to your nation with the message, making clear to them what We have sent you with to them, and a bringer of good tidings of Paradise to those who obey you, and a warner to those who disobey you of the immediate and deferred punishment, that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger, and support Allah by supporting His religion, and glorify Him and praise Him at the beginning of the day and at its end.
m-1010	"Those who pledge allegiance to you, O Prophet, at Al-Hudaybiyyah to fight, are only pledging allegiance to Allah and making a contract with Him, seeking His Paradise and His pleasure. The Hand of Allah is above their hands, so He is with them. He hears their words, sees their place, and knows their inner selves and their outward appearances. Whoever breaks his pledge, the consequences of that will only come back to him. And whoever fulfills what he has pledged to Allah of patience when meeting the enemy in the way of Allah and in support of His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, Allah will give him a great reward, which is Paradise. And in the verse is the confirmation of the attribute of the hand for Allah, the Most High, in a manner befitting Him, glory be to Him, without likening or specifying. Those of the Bedouins who stayed behind from going out with you to Mecca will say to you, O Prophet, if you rebuke them, “Our wealth and our families have occupied us, so ask your Lord to forgive us for staying behind.” They say that with their tongues, but it has no reality in their hearts. Say to them, “Who can control anything for you from Allah if He intends for you evil or good?” The matter is not as these hypocrites thought, that Allah does not know what their inner selves conceal of hypocrisy, but rather He, glory be to Him, is All-Knowing of what they do, and nothing is hidden from Him. Something from the works of His creation

It is not as you claimed that you were preoccupied with money and family, but rather you thought that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and those with him from his companions would perish and never return to you, and Satan made that seem good in your hearts, and you thought a bad thought that Allah would not grant victory to His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and his companions over their enemies, and you were a people who perished and there was no good in you

And whoever does not believe in Allah and what His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, brought and does not act according to His law, then he is a disbeliever who deserves punishment, for We have prepared for the disbelievers the torment of the Blazing Fire"
m-1011	To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them. He overlooks in His mercy whom He wills, so He conceals his sin and punishes in His justice whom He wills. And Allah, glory be to Him, is Forgiving and Merciful to those who repent to Him. Those who stayed behind will say, “When you set out, O Prophet, you and your companions, to the spoils of Khaybar that Allah promised you, let us go with you to Khaybar.” They want to change Allah’s promise to you by doing so. Say to them, “You will not go with us to Khaybar, because Allah, glory be to Him, told us before we returned to Medina that the spoils of Khaybar belong to those who witnessed Hudaybiyyah with us.” They will say, “The matter is not as you say. Allah did not command you to do this. You are preventing us from going out with you out of envy on your part so that we may not share the spoils with you.” The matter is not as they claimed, but they did not understand from Allah what is for them and what is against them of the matter of religion, except a little.
m-1012	Say to those who stayed behind from the Bedouins, that you will be called to fight a people who are very strong in fighting. You will fight them or they will submit without fighting. If you obey Allah in what He has called you to do, He will give you Paradise. But if you disobey Him, as you did when you stayed behind from the journey with the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to Mecca, He will punish you with a painful punishment. There is no sin upon the blind among you, O people, nor upon the lame nor upon the sick for staying behind from jihad with the believers due to their inability. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him to gardens beneath whose trees and palaces rivers flow. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and stays behind from jihad with the believers, He will punish him with a painful punishment.
m-1013	Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you, O Prophet, under the tree. This is the Pledge of Ridwan in Hudaybiyyah. Allah knew what was in the hearts of these believers of faith, truthfulness and loyalty, so Allah sent down tranquility upon them, strengthened their hearts and compensated them for what they had missed with the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah with an imminent victory, which is the conquest of Khaybar, and many spoils that you will take from the wealth of the Jews of Khaybar. Allah was Mighty in taking revenge on His enemies, Wise in managing the affairs of His creation. Allah promised you many spoils that you will take at the times that Allah has determined for you, so He hastened for you the spoils of Khaybar and restrained the hands of the people from you, so they did not You will not be afflicted with evil because of what your enemies had planned for you in terms of fighting and combat, and because they would not be able to harm those you left behind in the city. Their defeat, your safety, and your spoils will be a sign by which you may consider and prove that Allah is your protector and supporter and guides you to a straight path without any crookedness. Allah has promised you other spoils that you could not attain. Allah, the Most High, is able to do so, and they are under His control and dominion. He has promised them to you, and what He has promised will inevitably happen. Allah is Able to do all things, and nothing is beyond His power. If the infidels of Quraysh had fought you in Mecca, they would have fled from you and turned their backs on you, as one who is defeated in battle does. Then they would not find for themselves besides Allah a protector to befriend them in your war, nor a helper to assist them in fighting you. Allah has promised you many spoils that you will take at the times that Allah has determined for you. So He hastened for you the spoils of Khaybar and restrained the hands of the people from you, so you will not be afflicted with evil because of what your enemies had planned for you in terms of fighting and combat, and because they would not be able to harm those you left behind. Behind you in the city, and so that their defeat, your safety and your booty will be a sign by which you may consider and infer that Allah is your protector and supporter and guides you to a straight path without crookedness. Allah has promised you another booty that you were not able to obtain. Allah, the Most High, is able to do it and it is under His control and dominion. He has promised it to you and what He has promised must come to pass. Allah is capable of all things and nothing is beyond His power. If the infidels of Quraysh had fought you in Mecca, they would have fled from you and turned their backs on you as one who is defeated in battle does. Then they would not find for themselves besides Allah a protector to befriend them in your war or a helper to assist them in fighting you. Allah has promised you many booty that you will take at the times that Allah has determined for you. So He hastened for you the spoils of Khaybar and restrained the hands of the people from you, so that no harm befalls you from what your enemies had planned for you of fighting and fighting and from getting to those you left behind you in the city. So that their defeat, your safety and your booty will be a sign by which you may consider and infer that Allah is your protector. And He will support you and guide you to a straight path without crookedness. And God has promised you another spoil that you were not able to obtain. God Almighty is able to do it and it is under His control and dominion. And He has promised it to you and what He has promised will inevitably happen. And God is capable of all things and nothing is beyond His power. If the infidels of Quraysh fought you in Mecca, they would have fled from you and turned their backs on you as one who is defeated in battle does. Then they would not find for themselves besides God a protector to befriend them in your war nor a helper to assist them in fighting you. The law of God that He established in His creation before is the victory of His soldiers and the defeat of His enemies. And you will not find, O Prophet, any change in the law of God.
m-1014	"And it is He who restrained the hands of the polytheists from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after you had overpowered them, so they became under your authority. These polytheists are those who rebelled against the army of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, at Hudaybiyyah, and the Muslims captured them and then left them without killing them. They were about eighty men. And God is All-Seeing of your deeds, nothing is hidden from Him. The infidels of Quraysh are those who denied the Oneness of God and prevented you on the day of Hudaybiyyah from entering the Sacred Mosque and prevented the sacrificial animals and prevented them from reaching the place of their slaughter, which is the Sanctuary. And had it not been for the weak believing men and believing women among these infidels in Mecca who concealed their faith for fear for themselves, you would not have recognized them for fear that you might trample them with your army and kill them, and that killing would bring upon you a sin, a disgrace, and a penalty without knowledge. But We have given you authority over them so that God may admit into His mercy whomever He wills, and bestow upon them faith after disbelief. If these believing men and believing women had distinguished themselves from the polytheists of Mecca and had come out from among them, We would have punished those who disbelieved and denied among them with a severe punishment. Painful and painful
When those who disbelieved put in their hearts the arrogance of the Age of Ignorance so that they would not acknowledge the message of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and from that they refused to write in the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah, In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, and they refused to write, This is what Muhammad, the Messenger of God, has agreed upon. So God sent down tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers with him and made it obligatory for them to say, There is no god but God, which is the head of all piety. And the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, and the believers with him were more deserving of the word of piety than the polytheists, and they were likewise the people of this word, not the polytheists. And God is All-Knowing of all things, nothing is hidden from Him."
m-1015	Allah has fulfilled the vision that He showed His Messenger Muhammad in truth, that he and his companions would enter the Sacred House of Allah in safety, not fearing the polytheists, with their heads shaved and their hair shortened. Allah knew of the good and benefit in turning you away from Mecca that year and entering it later, which you did not know. So He made the victory that you were promised an imminent conquest before your entry into Mecca, which was the truce of Hudaybiyyah and the conquest of Khaybar. He is the One Who sent His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with the clear statement and the religion of Islam, to make it superior to all religions. Allah is sufficient for you, O Messenger, as a witness that He will support you and make your religion prevail over all religions. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and those with him are firm upon his religion against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating to Allah in their prayers, hoping that their Lord will bestow His favor upon them and admit them into Paradise and be pleased with them. The sign of their obedience to Allah is evident in their faces from the effect of prostration and worship. This is their description in the Torah and their description in the Gospel, like the description of a plant that puts forth its stalk and branches, then its branches multiply after that and the plant becomes strong and grows strong and stands upright on its stalks. Beautiful in appearance, pleasing to the farmers, to annoy the infidels with these believers in their large numbers and the beauty of their appearance. This is evidence of the disbelief of whoever hates the Companions, may God be pleased with them, because whoever God annoys with the Companions, then he has found in his right the reason for that, which is disbelief. God promised those among them who believed in God and His Messenger and did what God commanded them to do and avoided what He forbade them forgiveness for their sins and a great reward that will not be interrupted, which is Paradise. God’s promise is true, true, and will not be broken. Everyone who follows in the footsteps of the Companions, may God be pleased with them, is like them in deserving forgiveness and a great reward. They have the merit, precedence, and perfection that no one from this nation can reach. May God be pleased with them and satisfy them.
m-1016	O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger, do not decide a matter other than the command of Allah and His Messenger from the laws of your religion, lest you innovate, and fear Allah in your words and actions, lest they contradict the command of Allah and His Messenger. Indeed, Allah is Hearing of your words and Knowing of your intentions and actions. In this is a warning to the believers not to innovate in religion or legislate what Allah has not authorized. O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger and act according to His law, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet when addressing him, and do not call him loudly as some of you call to one another. Distinguish him in his speech as he was distinguished from others in his selection to carry the message of his Lord and the obligation of believing in him, loving him, obeying him, and following his example, for fear that your deeds will be invalidated while you do not perceive or sense that. Indeed, those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah are those whose hearts Allah has tested and made pure in piety to Him. For them is forgiveness for their sins from Allah and a great reward, which is Paradise. Indeed, those who call to you, O Prophet, from behind your chambers in a loud voice, most of them do not have the intelligence to carry them. On good manners with the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and respecting him. If they had been patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for them with God, because God has commanded them to respect you, and God is Forgiving of what they have committed out of ignorance of sins and breaches of etiquette, and Merciful to them, as He did not hasten to punish them.
m-1017	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if a wicked person comes to you with news, verify his news before believing it and transmitting it until you know its authenticity, for fear that you may harm innocent people with a crime committed by you and then regret it. Know that the Messenger of Allah is among you, so be polite with him, for he knows better than you what is good for you. He wants good for you, and you may want for yourselves evil and harm that which the Messenger does not agree with. If he obeyed you in many of the matters that you choose, that would lead to hardship for you, but Allah has endeared faith to you and made it beautiful in your hearts, so you believed, and He has made disbelief in Allah and disobeying Him and disobeying Him hateful to you. Those who are characterized by these qualities are the rightly guided ones who follow the path of truth. This good that has come to them is a favor and blessing from Allah upon them, and Allah is Knowing of those who are grateful for His blessings, Wise in managing the affairs of His creation.
m-1018	And if two parties of the people of faith should quarrel, then, O believers, make peace between them by calling them to resort to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and to accept their judgment. But if one of the two parties transgresses and refuses to respond to that, then fight it until it returns to the judgment of Allah and His Messenger. But if it returns, then make peace between them with fairness and be just in your judgment by not exceeding in your judgments the judgment of Allah and the judgment of His Messenger. Indeed, Allah loves those who are just in their judgments and judge between His creation with equity. And in this verse is proof of the attribute of love for Allah in truth as befits His Majesty, glory be to Him. The believers are but brothers in religion, so make peace between your two brothers if they quarrel, and fear Allah in all your affairs, hoping that you will receive mercy.
m-1019	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, let not a believing people ridicule a believing people; perhaps the one ridiculed among them will be better than the ridiculers. Nor let believing women ridicule believing women; perhaps the one ridiculed among them will be better than the ridiculers. And let not some of you insult others, nor call others by nicknames they dislike. Evil is the description and name of wickedness, which is mockery, backbiting, and name-calling after you have entered Islam and understood it. And whoever does not repent from this mockery, backbiting, name-calling, and wickedness, then those are the ones who have wronged themselves by committing these forbidden acts. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, avoid much of the evil of thinking about the believers, for some of that is a sin. And do not search for the faults of the Muslims, and do not say about one another behind their backs what they dislike. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when he is dead? You dislike that, so dislike backbiting him, and fear Allah in what He has commanded you. And He has forbidden you from it. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to His believing servants. O mankind, indeed We have created you from one father, Adam, and one mother, Eve. So there is no distinction between you in lineage. And We have made you, through reproduction, diverse peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most honorable of you in the sight of Allah is the most pious of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of the pious, Acquainted with them.
m-1020	"The Bedouins said, ""We have believed in Allah and His Messenger with complete faith."" Say to them, O Prophet, ""Do not claim for yourselves complete faith, but say, 'We have submitted,' while faith has not yet entered your hearts. And if you obey Allah and His Messenger, nothing will be diminished from the reward of your deeds. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to him who repents from his sins."" And in the verse is a warning to those who show faith and follow the Sunnah and whose deeds testify to the opposite. The believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, then did not doubt in their faith and spent their most precious possessions and their lives in jihad in the cause of Allah and in His obedience and in His pleasure. Those are the ones who are sincere in their faith. Say, O Prophet, to these Bedouins, ""Do you inform Allah of your religion and what is in your hearts, while Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth? Allah is Knowing of all things. Nothing is hidden from Him, whether faith or disbelief, righteousness or immorality, is in your hearts."" These Bedouins are doing you, O Prophet, a favor by their Islam, their following of you, and their support for you. Say to them, ""Do not do me a favor by your entering Islam, for the benefit of that will only return to you."" And Allah's favor upon you is that He has guided you to believe in Him and in His Messenger, if you are truthful in your faith. Indeed, Allah knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth. Nothing of that is hidden from Him. And Allah is Seeing of your deeds and will reward you for them, if good, then good, and if evil, then evil."
m-1021	"Q We have previously spoken about the disconnected letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah. God Almighty swore by the Noble Qur’an, the possessor of glory and honor.

Rather, the disbelievers in the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, were amazed that a warner had come to them from among themselves warning them of God’s punishment. The disbelievers in God and His Messenger said, “This is something strange and surprising.”

If we die and become dust, how can we return to what we were after that? That is a return that is unlikely to occur.

We know what the earth diminishes and destroys of their bodies, and with us is a book preserved from change and alteration with everything that happens to them in their lives and after their death.

Rather, these polytheists denied the Qur’an when it came to them, so they are in a confused and mixed state, not standing firm on anything, and their settlement is not stable.

They were heedless when they disbelieved in the resurrection, so they did not look at the sky above them, how We built it with flat sides and a firm structure, and adorned it with stars, and it has no cracks or gaps, so it is free from unevenness and defects.

And the earth We have expanded and spread it out, and We have placed therein firm mountains so that it will not tilt with its people, and We have grown therein of every kind, beautiful in appearance and beneficial, pleasing and delighting to the beholder.
God created the heavens and the earth and what is in them of great signs as a lesson for those who are blinded by ignorance and a reminder for every humble, fearful and fearful servant who returns to God Almighty. And We sent down from the sky abundant rain, and We caused to grow thereby gardens with many trees and harvested grain. And We caused to grow tall palm trees with clusters of dates, one above the other. We caused that to grow as a provision for the servants, by which they may eat according to their needs. And We revived with this water which We sent down from the sky a land that had become barren and dry, so that there was no crop or vegetation in it, just as We revived with this water the dead land. We will bring you forth on the Day of Resurrection alive after death."
m-1022	Before these polytheists from Quraysh, the people of Noah, the companions of the well, Thamud, ‘Ad, Pharaoh, the people of Lot, the companions of the thicket, the people of Shu’ayb, and the people of Tubba’ al-Himyari, all of these peoples denied their messengers, so the threat that Allah threatened them with for their disbelief came true.

Are we incapable of inventing the first creation that We created when it was nothing, so are we incapable of bringing them back into a new creation after their annihilation? We are not incapable of that, but We are the One Who will do it. They are capable, but they are confused and doubtful about the resurrection.
m-1023	"And We have certainly created man, and We know what his soul speaks to him, and We are nearer to him than his jugular vein, which is a vein in the neck connected to the heart.

When the two angels, lying in wait on his right and on his left, record his deeds, the one on the right records the good deeds and the one on the left records the bad deeds.

Not a word does he utter, but an angel is by him, watching his words and writing them down. He is an angel present and prepared for that.

And the severity of death came and overwhelmed him with the truth from which there is no turning back or escape. That is what you, O man, were fleeing and evading."
m-1024	"And the second blast of resurrection will be blown in the trumpet, that blast will be on the day of the threat that Allah has threatened the disbelievers with.

And every soul will come with two angels, one of whom will drive it to the place of assembly and the other will testify over it regarding what it did in this world of good and evil.

You were certainly in heedlessness of what you have witnessed today, O man. So We have removed from you your covering which covered your heart, so heedlessness has departed from you, and your sight today regarding what you testify is strong and intense.

And the angel, the writer and the witness, will say over it, ""This is what I have of the register of my deeds, and it is with Me, prepared, preserved and present.""

Allah will say to the two angels, the driver and the witness, after He has judged between the creatures, ""Throw into Hell every one who denies that Allah is the true God, who frequently disbelieves and denies, who is obstinate toward the truth, who refuses to fulfill his rights with regard to his wealth, who transgresses against Allah's servants and His limits, who doubts His promise and His threat, who associates others with Allah and worships with Him another deity from among His creation, so throw him into the severe punishment of Hell.

Allah will say to the two angels, the driver and the witness, after He has judged between the creatures, ""Throw into Hell every one who denies that Allah is the true God, who frequently disbelieves.""

Allah says to the two angels, the Driver and the Witness, after He has judged between the creatures, “Throw into Hell everyone who denies that Allah is the true God, who frequently disbelieves and denies, obstinate against the truth, refuses to perform his rights in his wealth, transgresses against the servants of Allah and His limits, doubts His promise and threat, who associates partners with Allah and worships with Him another deity from among His creation, so throw him into the severe punishment of Hell.”

His devil who was with him in this world said, “Our Lord, I did not misguide him, but he was on a path far from the path of guidance.”
Allah the Most High said, “Do not dispute with me today in the place of recompense and reckoning, for there is no benefit in that, and I have presented to you in this world the threat for whoever disbelieves in Me and disobeys Me.”

What changes the word with Me, and I do not punish anyone for the sin of anyone, so I do not punish anyone except for his sin after the proof has been established against him.

Remember, O Messenger For your people on the Day when We will say to Hell on the Day of Resurrection, “Are you filled?” Hell will say, “Are there any more jinn and men?” Then the Lord, glory be to Him, will place His foot in it, and some of them will withdraw into others and will say, “Enough, enough.”

And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, a place not far from them, so they will see it as an increase in their joy.

It will be said to them, “This is what you were promised, O righteous ones,” to every repentant of his sins, who has preserved all that brought him closer to his Lord of the obligatory duties and acts of worship, who feared Allah in this world and will meet Him on the Day of Resurrection with a heart repentant of his sins.

And it will be said to these believers, “Enter Paradise with safety from plagues and evils, safe from all hardships.” That is the Day of Eternity without interruption.

For these believers in Paradise will be whatever they desire, and with Us, in addition to what We have given them, is an increase in bliss, the greatest of which is the sight of the Face of Allah the Generous."
m-1025	"And before these polytheists from Quraysh, We destroyed many nations who were stronger and more powerful than them. They roamed the lands, built and destroyed them. Is there any escape from the punishment of Allah when it came to them?

Indeed, in the destruction of the past generations is a lesson for whoever has a heart to understand or listens while his heart is present, not heedless or absent-minded.

And We created the seven heavens and the earth and all that is between them of the kinds of creatures in six days. And We were not afflicted by that creation with any fatigue or weariness. In this great power, there is evidence of His ability, glory be to Him, to revive the dead, a fortiori.

So be patient, O Messenger, with what the deniers say, for Allah is watching them. Pray to your Lord, praising Him, with the dawn prayer before sunrise and the afternoon prayer before sunset. Pray at night and glorify the praises of your Lord after the prayers.

And listen, O Messenger, on the Day when the Angel will call by blowing the trumpet from a nearby place, the Day they hear the cry of the Resurrection, with the truth about which there is no doubt or uncertainty. That is the Day when the people of the graves will emerge from their graves.

Indeed, it is We who bring creation to life and cause them to die in this world, and to Us is their final destination, all on the Day of Resurrection, for reckoning and recompense. The Day when the earth will split open, revealing the dead buried therein, they will come out rushing to the Caller. That is the gathering at the place of reckoning for Us. Easy and simple.

We know best what these polytheists say of their fabrications against Allah and their denial of His revelations. You, O Messenger, have no authority over them to force them to Islam. You have only been sent as a messenger. So remind with the Qur’an whoever fears My threat, because whoever does not fear The threat is not mentioned"

Cursed are the liars who think other than the truth who are in the abyss of disbelief and And the misguided are heedless and persistent

m-1028	"Those who feared Allah will be in great gardens and flowing springs. Allah will give them all their wishes of various kinds of bliss. They will take it, pleased with it, rejoicing in their souls. They were, before that bliss, doers of good in this world with their righteous deeds. These doers of good used to sleep but little at night, praying to their Lord, devoutly obedient to Him. And in the last hours of the night before dawn, they would seek forgiveness from Allah for their sins. And in their wealth is a duty and a recommendation for the needy who ask people and those who do not ask them out of shyness. And in the earth are clear lessons and proofs of the power of its creation for those who are certain that Allah is the only true God, with no partner, and those who believe in His Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And in the creation of yourselves Evidence of the power of God Almighty and lessons that show you the oneness of your Creator and that there is no god for you who deserves worship other than Him. You have neglected them and do not see that and take heed from it.
And in the heaven is your provision and what you are promised of good and evil, reward and punishment and other than that, all of it is written and predestined.

m-1029	"Did the story of the guests of Abraham, whom he honored, reach you? They were from the honorable angels. When they entered his house, they greeted him, saying, “Peace be upon you.” He returned their greeting, saying, “Peace be upon you. You are a strange people. We do not know you.” So he turned away and secretly went to his family. He went to a fattened calf, slaughtered it, and roasted it over fire. Then he placed it in front of them. He gently invited them to the food, saying, “Will you not eat?” When he saw that they were not eating, he felt fear in himself of them. They said to him, “Do not fear. We are messengers of God.” They gave him the good news that his wife Sarah would give birth to a son who would be one of the people of knowledge of God and His religion, and he was Isaac, peace be upon him. When the wife of Abraham heard the words of these angels with the good news, she came towards them with a shout and slapped her face in astonishment at this matter and said, ""How can I give birth while I am an old, barren woman who cannot give birth?"" The angels of God said to her, ""Thus says your Lord, as We have informed you, and He is able to do that. So there is no wonder in His power. He, glory be to Him, is the Wise Who places things in their proper places, the Knower of the interests of His servants."" Abraham, peace be upon him, said to the angels of God, ""What is your business and why have you been sent?"" They said, ""Indeed, God has sent us to a people who have committed crimes because of their disbelief in God, that we may destroy them with stones of hardened clay, marked with your Lord for those who have transgressed the limits of immorality and disobedience."" Abraham, peace be upon him, said to the angels of God, ""What is your business and why have you been sent?"" They said, ""Indeed, God has sent us to a people who have committed crimes because of their disbelief in God, that we may destroy them with stones of hardened clay, marked with your Lord for those who have transgressed the limits of immorality and disobedience."" For their disbelief in Allah, We will destroy them with stones of hardened clay, a sign from your Lord for those who transgress the limit in immorality and disobedience.

Abraham, peace be upon him, said to the angels of Allah, ""What is the matter with you, and for what have you been sent?"" They said, ""Indeed, Allah has sent us to a people who have committed crimes because of their disbelief in Allah, that We may destroy them with stones of hardened clay, a sign from your Lord for those who transgress the limit in immorality and disobedience.""

So We brought out whoever was in the town of the people of Lot from the people of faith.

We did not find in that town except one house of Muslims, which was the house of Lot, peace be upon him.

And We left in the aforementioned town a trace of the torment remaining, a sign of the power of Allah Almighty and His vengeance on the disbelievers, and that is a lesson for those who fear the painful and grievous torment of Allah."
m-1030	"And in Our sending of Moses to Pharaoh and filling him with signs and manifest miracles is a sign for those who fear the painful punishment. But Pharaoh turned away, deceived by his power and turned away, and said of Moses, “He is a magician or a madman.” So We seized Pharaoh and his soldiers and threw them into the sea, and he was coming to what he was blamed for because of his disbelief, denial, and immorality. And in the case of ‘Ad and their destruction are signs and lessons for those who reflect, when We sent upon them the wind that had no blessing in it and brought no good. It did not leave anything it passed over except that it made it like a worn-out thing. And in the case of Thamud and their destruction are signs and lessons when it was said to them, “Benefit from your lives until your terms come to an end.” They disobeyed the command of their Lord, so the thunderbolt of punishment seized them while they were looking at their punishment with their own eyes.

And concerning Thamud and their destruction are signs and lessons when it was said to them, “Benefit from your lives until your terms come to an end.” But they disobeyed the command of their Lord, so the thunderbolt of punishment seized them while they were looking at their punishment with their own eyes.

And We destroyed the people of Noah before these. Indeed, they were a people who disobeyed the command of Allah and rebelled against His obedience."

And the earth - We made it a bed for creation to settle on. How excellent are We as providers.

And from every kind of existing thing We created two different kinds so that you may remember the power of Allah and take heed.

So flee, O people, from the punishment of Allah to His mercy by believing in Him and His Messenger and following His command and working in obedience to Him. Indeed, I am to you a warner, clear in warning. And when the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was distressed by a matter, he would resort to prayer, and this is fleeing to Allah.

And do not make with Allah another deity. Indeed, I am to you from Allah a warner, clear in warning."
m-1032	"Just as the Quraysh denied their Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and said, “He is a poet, a magician, or a madman,” so did the nations that denied their messengers before the Quraysh, so God brought down His punishment upon them. Did the first and the last people advise each other to deny the Messenger when they all said that? Rather, they are a people of tyrants whose hearts and deeds are alike in disbelief and tyranny. The later ones among them said that as the earlier ones said it. So, O Messenger, turn away from the polytheists until God’s command comes to you concerning them. You are not to be blamed by anyone, for you have conveyed what you were sent with. Despite your turning away from them, O Messenger, and not paying attention to their discouragement, continue to call to God and to admonish those to whom you were sent, for reminding and admonishing benefit the people of believing hearts, and in them is the establishment of proof against those who turn away. I did not create the jinn and mankind and sent all the messengers except for a lofty goal, which is to worship Me alone, without anyone else. I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed me, for I am the Provider and the Giver. He, glory be to Him, is not in need of creation, but they are the ones who are poor in Him in all their circumstances. He Their Creator, their Provider, and the One who is independent of them

Verily, Allah alone is the Provider of His creation, the One who guarantees their sustenance, the Possessor of Power, the Strong, He cannot be defeated or overcome, for He has all power and strength

Then for those who did wrong by denying the Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, there will be a portion of Allah’s punishment descending upon them like the portion of their companions who passed away before them, so do not hasten the punishment, for it will inevitably come to them

So destruction and misery for those who disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger from the day on which they are promised the punishment to descend upon them, which is the Day of Resurrection"

m-1035	So mention, O Messenger, to whom you were sent with the Qur’an. By the favor of Allah upon you of prophethood and sound mind, you are not a soothsayer who tells the unseen without knowledge, nor a madman who does not understand what he says, as they claim. Or do the polytheists say to you, O Messenger, “He is a poet through whom we await the coming of death?” Say to them, “Wait for my death, for I am with you among those awaiting the punishment for you, and you will see for whom the outcome will be.” Or do the polytheists say to you, O Messenger, “He is a poet through whom we await the coming of death?” Say to them, “Wait for my death, for I am with you among those awaiting the coming of death for you, and you will see for whom the outcome will be.”
m-1036	"Rather, do these deniers command their minds to say this contradictory statement? That the attributes of divination, poetry, and madness cannot come together at the same time? Rather, they are a people who have exceeded the limit in tyranny. Rather, do these polytheists say that Muhammad invented the Qur’an on his own? Rather, they do not believe, for if they believed, they would not have said what they said.

Let them come with words like the Qur’an if they are truthful in their claim that Muhammad invented it.

Were these polytheists created without a Creator or Maker for them, or are they the creators of themselves? Both matters are false and impossible. Thus, it is necessary that Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who created them, and He alone is the One Whom worship is not appropriate and is not suitable except for Him.

Or did they create the heavens and the earth according to this wondrous creation? Rather, they are not certain of Allah’s punishment, so they are polytheists.

Or do they have the treasures of your Lord that they dispose of, or are they the tyrants who have power over Allah’s creation by force and domination? This is not the case, rather, they are the helpless and weak.

Or do they have an ascent to the heavens in which they listen to the revelation that what they are upon is true? Let someone come forward who claims that he listened to that with an argument. Evidence that confirms his claim
Allah, the Most High, has daughters and you have sons, as you claim, a lie and a fabrication
Do you ask, O Messenger, these polytheists for a reward for conveying the message? They are in great difficulty and hardship from committing to a fine that you demand of them
Or do they have knowledge of the unseen, so they write it down for the people and inform them of it? It is not so, for no one knows the unseen in the heavens and the earth except Allah
Rather, they intend to plot against the Messenger of Allah and the believers. As for those who disbelieve, their plot and their plot will return upon themselves
Or do they have a deity worthy of worship other than Allah? He is exalted and exalted above what they associate with Him. He has no partner in dominion nor partner in oneness and worship
And if these polytheists saw pieces of the sky falling upon them as a punishment for them, they would not move from their denial and would say, “These are clouds piled up one above the other.”
So leave, O Messenger, these polytheists until they meet their day on which they will perish, which is the Day of Resurrection
And on that day, their plot will not avert from them anything from the punishment of Allah, nor will any helper be able to help them from the punishment of Allah
And indeed, these oppressors will have A torment they will encounter in this world before the torment of the Day of Resurrection, such as killing, captivity, the torment of the intermediate realm, and other things, but most of them do not know that."

So glorify the praises of your Lord and magnify Him and pray to Him, and do that at the dawn prayer when the stars set. In this verse, there is proof of the attribute of the two eyes for Allah the Most High in a manner befitting Him, without likening Him to His creation or defining His essence, glory be to Him, and praise be to Him, as This has been proven by the Sunnah and the early generations of the nation agreed upon it. The wording here is in the plural form for emphasis.
m-1038	"Allah the Almighty swears by the stars that if they set, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would not deviate from the path of guidance and truth, nor would he deviate from the right path. Rather, he is at the peak of uprightness, moderation, and correctness, and his speech is not based on his own desires. The Qur’an and the Sunnah are nothing but revelation from Allah to His Prophet Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was taught by an angel of great strength and beautiful appearance, namely Gabriel, peace be upon him, who appeared and rose in his true form to the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in the highest horizon, which is the horizon of the sun at its rising. Then Gabriel approached the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he increased in nearness, so his nearness was the length of two bows or closer than that. Then Allah the Almighty revealed to His servant Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, what He revealed through Gabriel, peace be upon him. Muhammad’s heart did not lie about what his eyes saw. Do you deny Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and argue with him about what he sees and witnesses of the signs of his Lord? Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw Gabriel in his true form another time at the Lote Tree of the Limit, a jujube tree, which is in the seventh heaven, to which what he ascends ends. From the earth and what descends from above it ends there. At it is the Garden of Refuge which the righteous have been promised. When the lote-tree is covered by the command of Allah, something great, whose description is known only to Allah, the Almighty. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in a great state of steadfastness and obedience. His sight did not turn right or left, nor did it go beyond what he was commanded to see. Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw on the Night of the Ascension some of the greatest signs of his Lord, indicating the power and greatness of Allah, from Paradise and Hell, and other things.

Has this one who cut off his giving the knowledge of the unseen that what is in his hand will run out until he holds on to his good deeds? He sees that clearly. This is not the case. Rather, he held back from charity, good deeds, righteousness, and kinship out of miserliness and stinginess.

And that He, glory be to Him, caused death to befall whomever He willed of His creation, and brought to life whomever He willed of their life, for He is the One, glory be to Him, in giving life and causing death.

And that He, glory be to Him, is the Lord of Sirius, which is a shining star that some of the people of ignorance used to worship instead of Allah.

And that He, glory be to Him, destroyed the first ‘Aad, who were the people of Hud, and destroyed Thamud, who were the people of Salih, and did not leave a single one of them, and He destroyed the people of Noah before these, who were more severe. And that He, glory be to Him, destroyed the first ‘Ad, who were the people of Hud, and destroyed Thamud, who were the people of Salih, and none of them remained.

They denied the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and followed their misguidance and what their desires led them to do of denial. Every matter of good or evil will befall its people on the Day of Resurrection when the reward and punishment appear.

The infidels of Quraysh have received from the news of the nations that denied their messengers and the torment that befell them what is sufficient to deter them from their disbelief and misguidance.

This Qur’an that came to them is a great wisdom that is extremely far-reaching, so what good are warnings for a people who turned away and denied it?

So turn away, O Messenger, from them and await for them a great day, the day when the Angel will call with the blowing of the horn to a terrible and reprehensible matter, which is the place of reckoning.

Their eyes will be humbled, they will emerge from The graves will be as if, in their spread and speed of their march to the reckoning, they were locusts spreading across the horizons, rushing to that to which they were called.

They denied Our servant Noah and said, “He is mad.” They rebuked him, threatening him with various kinds of harm if he did not desist from his call. Then Noah called upon his Lord, “I am weak to resist these people, so grant me victory through a punishment from You for their disbelief in You.” So We answered his call, and We opened the gates of heaven with abundant flowing water, and We split the earth with springs gushing with water. So the water of the sky and the water of the earth met, for their destruction which God had decreed for them as a recompense for their polytheism. And We carried Noah and those with him on a ship of planks and nails, fastened together, running under Our sight and protection.

Is there any who will take heed and be admonished? So how was My punishment and warning for those who disbelieved in Me and denied My messengers and did not take heed of what they brought?

It uprooted people from their places on the earth and threw them on their heads, crushing their necks and separating their heads from their bodies, leaving them like palm trees uprooted from their roots.

We will bring out the she-camel that they asked from the rock, as a test for them, so await, O Salih, what will befall them of punishment, and be patient in your call to them and their harm to you.

And tell them that the water is divided among your people, and the she-camel will have one day for the she-camel and another day for them. Every drink is brought by the one who has been given its portion and is forbidden to the one who has not been given its portion

So they called their companion to urge them to hamstring her, so he took the she-camel in his hand and slaughtered her, so I punished them. How was My punishment for their disbelief and My warning to those who disobeyed My messengers?

Indeed, We sent Gabriel to them, and he shouted at them with a single shout, and they were all destroyed, and they were like dry crops that are made a fence for camels and livestock.

We reward those who believe in Us and are grateful to Us.

Indeed, Lot frightened his people with the wrath of Allah and His punishment, but they did not listen to him, rather, they doubted that and denied him.

And indeed, they asked him to commit an immoral act with his guests from the angels, so We blinded their eyes, so they did not see a thing. Then it was said to them, ""Taste My punishment and My warning with which Lot, peace be upon him, warned you.""

And indeed, there came to them at the time of the morning an everlasting punishment that settled upon them until it led them to the punishment of the Hereafter. That punishment is the stoning of them and the overturning of their villages.

The group of disbelievers of Mecca will be defeated by the believers and they will turn their backs, and this happened on the day of Badr.

Indeed, Allah is Powerful and cannot be overcome, Exalted in Might and cannot be overcome. And We sent Noah and Abraham to their people and made among their descendants prophethood and revealed scriptures. But among their descendants is one who is guided to the truth, and many of them are disobedient to Allah. Then We followed up in the footsteps of Noah and Abraham with Our messengers whom We sent with clear proofs. And We followed up with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel. And We placed in the hearts of those who followed him in his religion gentleness and compassion, so they were affectionate to one another. And they innovated monasticism by exaggerating in worship. We did not impose it upon them. Rather, they are the ones who adhered to it of their own accord, intending thereby to please Allah, but they did not perform it with the right performance. So We gave those among them who believed in Allah and His messengers their reward according to their faith, and many of them are disobedient to Allah, denying the sons of Muhammad.

Allah Almighty gave you all of this so that the People of the Book who did not believe in Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, may know that they do not have power over anything of Allah’s bounty, earning it for themselves or giving it to others, and that all bounty is in the hand of Allah alone.

And those who forbid their women to themselves by zihar-i-dhihar, then they go back on their statement and decide to have intercourse with their wives, then the husband who zihar-i-dhihar in this case must pay the expiation of the prohibition, which is to free a believing slave, male or female, before He has intercourse with his wife from whom he has made an oath of divorce. This is the ruling of Allah regarding one who has made an oath of divorce from his wife. You are admonished by it, O believers, so that you do not fall into the practice of zihar and false speech and become disbelievers if you fall into it and so that you do not return to it. And Allah knows nothing of your deeds and He will reward you for them. So whoever does not find a slave to free, then he must fast for two consecutive months before he has intercourse with his wife. And whoever is unable to fast for two months due to a legitimate excuse, then he must feed sixty poor people what will satisfy them. This is what we have explained to you regarding the rulings of zihar so that you may believe in Allah, follow His Messenger, act according to what Allah has prescribed and abandon what you were doing in your ignorance. And those rulings mentioned are the commands of Allah and His limits, so do not transgress them. And for those who deny them there is a painful punishment."
m-1076	Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger and disobey their command will be let down and humiliated, just as those before them were let down from the nations who opposed Allah and His Messengers. And We have sent down clear verses indicating that Allah’s law and His limits are true. And for those who deny those verses is a humiliating punishment in Hell. And remember, O Messenger, the Day of Resurrection, the Day when Allah will bring all the dead to life and gather the first and the last on one plain. Then He will inform them of what they did of good and evil, which Allah has enumerated and recorded in the Preserved Tablet and preserved for them in their records of deeds, although they had forgotten it. And Allah is Witness over all things. Nothing is hidden from Him.
m-1077	Did you not know that Allah, the Most High, knows everything in the heavens and the earth? No three of His creations confer privately in a secret conversation except that He is the fourth of them with His knowledge and encompassing. Nor are there five except that He is the sixth of them. Nor are there fewer than these numbers mentioned nor more than them except that He is with them with His knowledge, wherever they may be. Nothing of their affair is hidden from Him. Then He, the Most High, will inform them on the Day of Resurrection of what they did of good and evil and will reward them for it. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things. Have you not seen, O Messenger, the Jews who forbade secret talk about what arouses doubt in the souls of the believers, then they return to what they were forbidden from and speak secretly about what is sinful, aggressive and disobedient to the command of the Messenger? And when these Jews come to you, O Messenger, for a matter of matters, they greet you with a greeting other than the greeting that Allah has made for you, and they say, “As-Samu ‘Alayka,” meaning, “Death to you,” and they say among themselves, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say to Muhammad?” If he is truly a Messenger, Hell will suffice for them. They will enter it and suffer its heat. What an evil place of return it is. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if you speak among yourselves in secret, do not speak about what is in it. Sin from speech or what is aggression towards others or disobedience to the command of the Messenger and speak about what is good and obedient and kind and fear Allah by complying with His commands and avoiding His prohibitions, for to Him alone is your return with all your deeds and words that He has counted against you and He will reward you for them. Secretly speaking about sin and aggression is from the whisperings of Satan, for he is the one who beautifies it and incites it to bring sadness into the hearts of the believers, and that does not harm the believers at all except by the will and desire of Allah Almighty, and upon Allah alone let the believers rely.
m-1078	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if you are asked to make room for one another in gatherings, then make room for one another, and Allah will make room for you in this world and the Hereafter. And if you, O believers, are asked to leave your gatherings for a matter in which there is good for you, then stand up, and Allah will raise the status of the sincere believers among you and raise the status of the people of knowledge by many degrees in reward and ranks of approval. And Allah is All-Knowing of your deeds, nothing of them is hidden from Him, and He will reward you for them. And in the verse there is a mention of the status of scholars, their virtue, and the raising of their degrees.
m-1079	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, if you wish to speak to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, secretly between you and him, then give charity before that to the needy. That is better for you because of the reward in it and purer for your hearts from sins. But if you do not find anything to give in charity, then there is no blame upon you, for Allah is Forgiving to His believing servants, Most Merciful towards them. Did you fear poverty if you gave charity before conversing with the Messenger of Allah? So if you did not do what you were commanded to do and Allah accepted your repentance and granted you permission not to do it, then be steadfast and continue to establish prayer, give zakat, and obey Allah and His Messenger in everything you were commanded to do. And Allah, the Exalted, is Aware of your deeds and will reward you for them.
m-1080	Have you not seen the hypocrites who took the Jews as friends and befriended them? The hypocrites are in fact neither Muslims nor Jews. They swear falsely that they are Muslims and that you are the Messenger of Allah, and they know that they are lying in what they swear. Allah has prepared for these hypocrites a punishment of extreme severity and pain. Evil is what they used to do of hypocrisy and swearing falsely. The hypocrites took their false oaths as a protection for themselves from being killed because of their disbelief and to prevent the Muslims from fighting them and taking their money. Because of that, they turned themselves and others away from the path of Allah, which is Islam. So they will have a humiliating punishment in the Fire because of their arrogance in believing in Allah and His Messenger and turning them away from His path. Neither their money nor their children will protect the hypocrites from the punishment of Allah at all. Those are the people of the Fire. They will enter it and remain in it forever, never coming out of it. This punishment includes everyone who turned away from the religion of Allah by word or deed. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will raise all the hypocrites from their graves alive, and they will swear to Him that they were believers, just as they used to swear to you, O believers, in this world, and they believe that this is It benefits them with Allah as it benefited them in this world with the Muslims. Indeed, they are the ones who have reached a level of lying that no one else has reached. Satan has overcome them and taken control of them until they abandoned the commands of Allah and the work of obeying Him. Those are the party of Satan and his followers. Indeed, the party of Satan are the losers in this world and the Hereafter. Indeed, those who disobey the command of Allah and His Messenger are among the humiliated, defeated, and disgraced in this world and the Hereafter. Allah has written in the Preserved Tablet and decreed that victory is for Him and for His Book, His Messengers, and His believing servants. Indeed, Allah, the Exalted, is Strong, and nothing is beyond His power. He is Mighty over His creation.
m-1081	You will not find, O Messenger, a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day and do what Allah has prescribed for them, loving and being friends with those who are hostile to Allah and His Messenger and oppose their command, even if they were their fathers, sons, brothers, or relatives. Those are the ones who are friends for the sake of Allah and the ones who are hostile for the sake of Allah. Faith is established in their hearts and He strengthens them with victory from Him and support against their enemy in this world. He will admit them to gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow, wherein they will abide for an extended period of time. Allah will permit His pleasure to be granted to them, so He will not be angry with them. They will be pleased with their Lord for what He has given them of honors and exalted degrees. Those are the party of Allah and His friends, and it is they who are the successful in achieving happiness in this world and the Hereafter.
m-1082	Allah is far removed from everything that is not befitting of Him, everything in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Almighty who cannot be overcome, the Wise in His power, management, creation and legislation. He places things in their proper places. He, glory be to Him, is the One Who expelled those who denied the prophethood of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, from the People of the Book, and they are the Jews of Banu Nadir, from their dwellings where they lived next to the Muslims around Medina. This was their first expulsion from the Arabian Peninsula to the Levant. You Muslims did not think that they would leave their homes in this humiliation and disgrace, due to the severity of their strength and the power of their defense. The Jews thought that their fortresses would protect them from the wrath of Allah and that no one could overcome them. So Allah came to them from where they had never imagined and cast fear and intense terror into their hearts. They destroyed their homes with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed, O people of sound insight and sound minds, from what happened to them. Had Allah not decreed for them to leave their homes and decreed it, He would have punished them in this world with killing and captivity, and in the Hereafter they will have the punishment of the Fire. This is what happened to the Jews in this world and what awaits them in the Hereafter, because They disobeyed the command of Allah and the command of His Messenger in the most severe disobedience, and fought them and sought to disobey them. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, then indeed Allah is severe in punishment for him. Whatever palm tree you cut down, O believers, or left standing on its trunk without interfering with it, it was by Allah’s permission and command, and so that He might humiliate those who disobeyed Him and disobeyed His command and prohibition, as He empowered you to cut down their palm trees and burn them.
m-1083	And what Allah gave to His Messenger from the wealth of the Jews of Banu Nadir, you did not ride horses or camels to obtain it, but Allah gives power to His messengers over whomever He wills of His enemies, so they surrender to them without fighting. And the spoils are what He took from the wealth of the disbelievers by right without fighting. And Allah is over all things competent, nothing is beyond His power. What Allah gave to His Messenger from the wealth of the polytheists of the towns, without riding horses or camels, is for Allah and His Messenger, and it is spent in the public interests of the Muslims and for the relatives of the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the orphans, who are the poor children whose fathers have died, and the needy, who are the people of need and poverty, and the wayfarer, who is the stranger traveling who has run out of money and whose money has been cut off from him. This is so that the money is not the property of the rich alone and the poor and needy are deprived of it. And whatever the Messenger has given you of wealth or prescribed for you by law, take it, and whatever he has forbidden you from taking or doing, refrain from it. And fear Allah by obeying His commands and abandoning His prohibitions. Indeed, Allah is severe in punishment for whoever disobeys Him and goes against His commands and prohibitions. And the verse is the basis for The obligation to act in accordance with the Sunnah, whether in word, deed or approval
m-1084	Likewise, from the money that Allah has bestowed upon His Messenger are given to the poor emigrants who were forced by the infidels of Mecca to leave their homes and their wealth, asking Allah to bestow upon them provision in this world and contentment in the Hereafter, and to support the religion of Allah and His Messenger by striving in the cause of Allah. These are the truthful ones who have proven their words true with their actions. And those who settled in Madinah and believed before the emigration of the emigrants, who are the Ansar, love the emigrants and support them with their wealth, and do not find in themselves any envy of them for what they have been given of the spoils of war and other wealth, and they give precedence to the emigrants and those in need over themselves, even if they are in need and poverty. And whoever is free from miserliness and withholding the surplus of wealth, then these are the successful ones who have achieved what they sought. And those who came from the believers after the Ansar and the first emigrants say, “Our Lord, forgive us our sins and forgive our brothers in religion who preceded us in faith and do not put in our hearts any envy or hatred toward any of the people of faith. Our Lord, You are indeed Kind to Your servants, Merciful toward them.” And in the verse is evidence that a Muslim should remember his predecessors with goodness and pray for them and love The companions of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and he mentions them with goodness and is pleased with them
m-1085	Have you not seen the hypocrites saying to their brothers in disbelief from the Jews of Banu Nadir, “If Muhammad and those with him expel you from your homes, we will go out with you, and we will never obey anyone concerning you.” We have asked whether they will desert you or not go out with you. And if they fight you, we will help you against them. And God bears witness that the hypocrites are liars in what they promised the Jews of Banu Nadir. If the Jews are expelled from Madinah, the hypocrites will not go out with them. And if they are fought, they will not fight with them as they promised. And if they fight with them, they will turn their backs in flight, defeated. Then God will not help them, but will abandon them and humiliate them. The fear and dread of the hypocrites for you, O believers, is greater and more intense in their hearts than their fear and dread of God, and that is because they are a people who do not understand the greatness of God and faith in Him, nor do they fear His punishment. The Jews do not confront you in a united battle except in villages fortified with walls and trenches or from behind walls. Their enmity among themselves is intense. You think that they are united on one word, but their hearts are divided. This is because they are a people who do not understand the command of Allah nor do they ponder His signs. The example of these Jews in what befell them of Allah’s punishment is like the example of the infidels of Quraysh on the day of Badr and the Jews of Banu Qaynuqa’, who tasted the evil consequences of their disbelief and enmity towards the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a painful and grievous punishment. The example of these hypocrites in tempting the Jews to fight and promising them victory over the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is like the example of Satan when he made disbelief seem attractive to man and called him to it, but when he disbelieved, he said, “Indeed, I am innocent of you. Indeed, I fear Allah, the Lord of all creation.” The consequence of the matter of Satan and the man who obeyed him and disbelieved was that they would both be in the Fire, abiding therein forever. This is the recompense of the transgressors who exceed the limits of Allah.
m-1086	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, fear Allah and beware of His punishment by doing what He has commanded you and leaving what He has forbidden you. And let every soul reflect on what it has put forth of deeds for the Day of Resurrection. And fear Allah in all that you do and what you leave. Indeed, Allah, the Exalted, is Acquainted with what you do. Nothing of your deeds is hidden from Him, and He will reward you for them. And do not be, O believers, like those who neglected to perform the right of Allah which He has enjoined upon them, so He caused them to forget because of that their portions of good deeds that would save them from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection. Those are the ones described as immoral, those who have gone beyond the obedience of Allah and His Messenger. The tormented companions of the Fire and the blessed companions of Paradise are not equal. The companions of Paradise are the victorious in everything they seek, the saved from every harm.
m-1087	If We had sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain, and it had understood what is in it of promise and threat, you would have seen it, despite its strength, hardness and enormity, humbled, and cracked from fear of Allah. We present and explain these examples to the people, so that they may reflect on the power and greatness of Allah. The verse urges contemplation of the Qur’an, understanding its meanings and acting upon it. He is Allah, the Exalted, the Worshipped in truth, there is no god but Him, the Knower of the secret and the public, He knows what is hidden and what is present. He is the Most Gracious, whose mercy encompasses all things, the Most Merciful to those who believe in Him. He is Allah, the Worshipped in truth, there is no god but Him, the King of all things, who disposes of them without resistance or defense, the One free from all deficiency, who is free from all faults, who confirmed His messengers and prophets with what He sent them of clear signs, the Watcher over all His creation in their deeds, the Mighty, who cannot be overcome, the Compeller, who has subdued all servants and to whom all creation has submitted, the Proud, to whom belongs pride and greatness. Allah is far removed from everything they associate with Him in His worship. He is Allah. Glory be to Him, the Most High, the Creator, the Determiner of creation, the Maker, the Originator, the Bringer into being according to His wisdom, the Fashioner of His creation as He wills. Glory be to Him, to Him belong the most beautiful names and the most sublime attributes. Everything in the heavens and the earth glorifies Him. He is the Exalted in Might, Severe in Retribution against His enemies, Wise in His management of the affairs of His creation.
m-1088	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, do not take My enemy and your enemy as friends and loved ones, to whom you confide your love, and inform them of the news of the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and all the Muslims, while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth of belief in Allah and His Messenger and what was revealed to him of the Qur’an. They expel the Messenger and you, O believers, from Mecca because you believe in Allah, your Lord, and you make Him One. If you, O believers, have migrated as fighters in My cause, seeking My pleasure on your behalf, then do not befriend My enemies and your enemies, to whom you confide your love in secret, and I know what you have concealed and what you have revealed. And whoever does that among you has certainly strayed from the path of truth and righteousness and has gone astray from the right path. If those to whom you confide your love gain control of you, they will wage war against you and extend their hands to you with killing and captivity and their tongues with insults and abuse, and they have wished in any case that you would disbelieve like them. Your relatives and your children will not benefit you at all when you befriend the disbelievers for their sake. On the Day of Resurrection, Allah will separate you and the people of Those who obey Him will go to Paradise, and those who disobey Him will go to Hell. God is All-Seeing of what you do. Nothing of your words or deeds is hidden from Him.
m-1089	Indeed, you, O believers, have a good example in Abraham, peace be upon him, and those who were with him among the believers, when they said to their people who disbelieved in God, “Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship besides God of deities and equals. We have disbelieved in you and denied what you are upon of disbelief, and there has appeared between us and you forever enmity and hatred as long as you remain in your disbelief until you believe in God alone.” But following the example does not include Abraham’s asking forgiveness for his father, for that was before it became clear to Abraham that his father was an enemy of God. So when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God, he disassociated himself from him. Our Lord, upon You we have relied, and to You we have returned in repentance, and to You is the return on the Day of Resurrection. Our Lord, do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve by Your punishment of us, or by giving the disbelievers power over us so that they tempt us away from our religion, or by gaining dominance over us so that they are tempted by that and say, “If these were upon the truth, this punishment would not have afflicted them,” so they increase in disbelief. And conceal for us our sins by Your pardon of them. Our Lord, indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might who cannot be overcome. The Wise in His words and deeds. Indeed, you, O believers, have a good example in Abraham, peace be upon him, and we are disassociated from Him. In Abraham, peace be upon him, and those with him is a praiseworthy example for those who hope for good from Allah in this world and the Hereafter. And whoever turns away from what Allah has urged him to do, which is to follow the example of His prophets and befriend the enemies of Allah, then Allah is the One who is independent of His servants, the Praiseworthy in His Essence and Attributes, the Praised in every situation. It may be that Allah will establish between you, O believers, and those of your relatives from among the polytheists whom you have been hostile to, love after hatred, and friendship after animosity, by opening their hearts to Islam. And Allah is Able to do all things, and Allah is Forgiving to His servants, Merciful to them.
m-1090	Allah does not forbid you, O believers, from those who have not fought you from the disbelievers because of religion and have not expelled you from your homes - from honoring them with good and being just toward them by being kind to them and righteous toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who are just in their words and deeds. Allah only forbids you from those who have fought you because of religion and have expelled you from your homes and have aided the disbelievers in expelling you - from taking them as allies and friends. And whoever takes them as helpers and friends against the believers - then it is those who are the wrongdoers to themselves, who have transgressed the limits set by Allah.
m-1091	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, when believing women come to you as emigrants from the land of disbelief to the land of Islam, test them to know the truth of their faith. Allah knows best the truth of their faith. If you ascertain that they are believers according to what appears to you of signs and clear proofs, then do not send them back to their disbelieving husbands. It is not lawful for believing women to marry disbelievers, nor is it lawful for disbelievers to marry believing women. And give the husbands of those who have accepted Islam the like of what they have spent on them of dowries. And there is no sin upon you if you marry them if you have given them their dowries. And do not hold on to the marriage of your disbelieving wives. And demand from the polytheists what you have spent of the dowries of your women who have apostatized from Islam and joined them, and let them demand what they have spent of the dowries of their Muslim women who have accepted Islam and joined you. That is the ruling mentioned in the verse, and He judges between you, so do not contradict it. And Allah is Knowing, nothing is hidden from Him. Wise in His words and actions. To the infidels, and the infidels did not give you their dowries which you had paid to them, then you defeated these infidels or others and were victorious over them, then give those whose wives were lost from the Muslims from the spoils or other than them the same as what they had given them of dowries before that, and fear God in whom you are believers.
m-1092	O Prophet, when believing women come to you, making a covenant with you that they will not associate with Allah any partner in His worship, nor will they steal anything, nor will they commit adultery, nor will they kill their children after birth or before, nor will they attribute to their husbands children who are not theirs, nor will they disobey you in what you command them to do, then make a covenant with them regarding that, and ask forgiveness for them from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of the sins of His repentant servants, Most Merciful. O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger, do not take as friends those with whom Allah has become angry because of their disbelief. They have despaired of Allah’s reward in the Hereafter, just as the disbelievers who are buried despaired of Allah’s mercy in the Hereafter when they saw the reality of the matter and knew with certainty that they have no share in it, or just as the disbelievers despaired of the resurrection of their dead, the inhabitants of the graves, because they believed that there would be no resurrection.
m-1093	God is far removed from everything that is not befitting of Him, everything in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Almighty who cannot be overcome, the Wise in His words and deeds. O you who have believed in God and His Messenger and acted according to His law, you do not break a promise or say a word and do not fulfill it. This is a denial of those whose actions contradict His words. Great is the hatred in the sight of God that you say with your tongues what you do not do. Indeed, God loves those who fight in His cause in rows as if they were a solid, solid structure through which the enemy cannot penetrate. In the verse, there is a statement of the virtue of jihad and the mujahideen, due to the love of God Almighty for His believing servants when they stand in rows facing the enemies of God, fighting them in His cause.
m-1094	And remember to your people, O Messenger, when the Prophet of God, Moses, peace be upon him, said to his people, “Why do you harm me in word and deed while you know that I am the Messenger of God to you?” But when they turned away from the truth despite their knowledge of it and persisted in that, God turned their hearts away from accepting guidance as punishment for their deviation which they chose for themselves. And God does not guide the people who go beyond obedience and the path of truth.
m-1095	And remember, O Messenger, to your people when Jesus, son of Mary, said to his people, “Indeed, I am the Messenger of Allah to you, confirming what came before me of the Torah, and bearing witness to the truth of a Messenger who will come after me, whose name is Ahmad, and he is Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and calling to believe in him.” But when Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to them with clear signs, they said, “This that you have brought us is obvious magic.” No one is more unjust and aggressive than he who invents lies about Allah and attributes to Him partners in His worship, while he is calling to enter Islam and to sincerely worship Allah alone. And Allah does not guide those who wrong themselves through disbelief and polytheism to that in which there is success for them. These wrongdoers want to invalidate the truth with which Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was sent, which is the Qur’an, with their false statements. And Allah is the Manifester of the Truth by completing His religion, even though the deniers and liars hate it. Allah is the One Who sent His Messenger Muhammad with the Qur’an and the religion of Islam to make it superior to all other religions, even though the polytheists hate it.
m-1096	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, have I guided you to a great trade that will save you from a painful punishment? You persist in your faith in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah to support His religion with whatever you possess of wealth and lives. That is better for you than the trade of this world, if you only knew the harms and benefits of things, so comply with that. If you do, O believers, what Allah has commanded you to do, He will cover your sins for you and admit you to gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow and pure, fragrant dwellings in gardens of perpetual residence that will never be interrupted. That is the triumph after which there is no triumph. And another blessing for you, O believers, that you love: a victory from Allah that will come to you and an immediate conquest that will be accomplished by your hands. And give good tidings to the believers, O Prophet, of victory and conquest in this world and Paradise in the Hereafter ... Victory from Allah will come to you and an immediate conquest will be accomplished by your hands. Give good tidings to the believers, O Prophet, of victory and conquest in this world and Paradise in the Hereafter. O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, be supporters of the religion of Allah as the chosen ones of Jesus were supporters of the religion of Allah when Jesus said to them, “Who among you will undertake to support me and assist me in that which brings one closer to Allah?” They said, “We are supporters of the religion of Allah.” So a party of the Children of Israel was guided and a party went astray. So We supported those who believed in Allah and His Messenger and gave them victory over those of the Christian sects who opposed them, so they became dominant over them. That was through the mission of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
m-1097	Allah is far removed from everything that is not befitting of Him, everything in the heavens and the earth, and He alone is the Owner of everything, the Disposer of it without dispute, the Exalted from all deficiency, the Mighty Who cannot be overcome by the Wise in His management and creation. Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who sent among the Arabs who did not read and had no book or trace of a message, a Messenger from among themselves to all people, to recite the Qur’an to them, purify them from corrupt beliefs and bad morals, and teach them the Qur’an and the Sunnah. Indeed, before his mission, they were clearly deviating from the truth. And He, the Exalted, sent him to another people who had not yet come and will come from the Arabs and others. And Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who is Mighty, Victorious over all things, the Wise in His words and deeds. Allah, the Exalted, is the One Who sent among the Arabs who did not read and had no book or trace of a message, a Messenger from among themselves to all people, to recite the Qur’an to them, purify them from corrupt beliefs and bad morals, and teach them the Qur’an and the Sunnah. Indeed, before his mission, they were clearly deviating from the truth. And He, the Exalted, sent him to another people who had not yet come and will come from the Arabs and others. And they will come from the Arabs and others, and God Almighty alone is the Almighty, the Victorious over all things, the Wise in His words and deeds. This sending of the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, to the Arab nation and others is a favor from God that He gives to whomever He wills of His servants, and He alone is the possessor of benevolence and abundant giving.
m-1098	The Jews who were charged with working according to the Torah but did not work according to it are like a donkey who carries books and does not know what is ugly in them. Like the people who denied the signs of Allah and did not benefit from them. Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people who transgress His limits and go out of His obedience. Say, O Messenger, to those who adhere to the distorted Jewish religion: If you falsely claim that you are beloved to Allah to the exclusion of others from the people, then wish for death if you are truthful in your claim that Allah loves you. These Jews will never wish for death, preferring the life of this world over the Hereafter and fearing Allah’s punishment for what they have done of disbelief and evil deeds. Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers. Nothing of their wrongdoing is hidden from Him. Say: The death you are fleeing from is inevitable. It will come to you when your appointed times come. Then you will return on the Day of Resurrection to Allah, the Knower of what is hidden and what is present. He will inform you of your deeds and will reward you for them.
m-1099	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, when the muezzin calls to prayer on Friday, then proceed to listen to the sermon and perform the prayer and leave buying and selling and everything that distracts you from it. That which you have been commanded to do is better for you because it contains forgiveness of your sins and reward from Allah for you. If you know what is in your best interests, then do that. The verse is evidence of the obligation to attend Friday prayers and listen to the sermon. When you hear the sermon and perform the prayer, then disperse in the land and seek from Allah’s provision through your efforts and remember Allah often in all your circumstances so that you may attain the good of this world and the Hereafter. If some Muslims see a trade or something from the amusement and adornment of this world, they disperse to it and leave you, O Prophet, standing on the pulpit giving the sermon. Say to them, O Prophet, what is with Allah of reward and bliss is more beneficial for you than amusement and trade, and Allah alone is the best of providers and givers, so seek from Him and seek help through His obedience to attain what He has of the good of this world and the Hereafter.
m-1100	If the hypocrites attend your council, O Messenger, they will say with their tongues, “We bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah.” And Allah knows that you are the Messenger of Allah, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars in what they have shown of their testimony to you and swore to it with their tongues, while they concealed disbelief in it. The hypocrites only made the oaths they swore a cover and a protection for themselves from being held accountable and punished, and they prevented themselves and prevented people from the straight path of Allah. Indeed, what they were doing was evil. That is because they believed outwardly, then disbelieved inwardly, so Allah sealed their hearts because of their disbelief, so they do not understand what is good for them. And if you look at these hypocrites, you will be amazed by their appearance and their looks, and if they speak, you will hear their speech because of the eloquence of their tongues, and because their hearts are empty of Faith and their minds of understanding and beneficial knowledge are like wood thrown against a wall that has no life in it. They think that every loud sound is falling on them and is harmful to them because of their knowledge of the reality of their situation and their extreme cowardice and the terror that has taken hold of their hearts. They are the true enemies, intensely hostile to you and to the believers. So beware of them. May God disgrace them and expel them from His mercy. How can they turn away from the truth to what they are in of hypocrisy and misguidance?
m-1101	"And when it is said to these hypocrites, ""Come back, repentant and apologizing for what you have said and spoken foolishly, and the Messenger of Allah asks forgiveness for you and asks Allah to forgive you and pardon you for your sins,"" they tilt their heads and shake them in mockery and arrogance, and you see them, O Messenger, turning away from you, while they are arrogant about complying with what was asked of them. It is the same for these hypocrites whether you ask forgiveness from Allah for them, O Messenger, or do not ask for it for them. Indeed, Allah will never forgive their sins because of their persistence in immorality and their steadfastness in disbelief. Indeed, Allah does not guide to faith the people who disbelieve in Him and are disobedient to His obedience. These hypocrites are the ones who say to the people of Medina, ""Do not spend on the companions of the Messenger of Allah from the emigrants until they disperse from him."" And to Allah alone belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them of provisions. He gives them to whomever He wills and withholds them from whomever He wills. But the hypocrites have no understanding, and that does not benefit them. These hypocrites say, ""If we return to Medina, our more honorable group will surely expel from it the more humbled group of the believers."" And to Allah belongs glory. And for his Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace, and for the believers in God and his Messenger, not for anyone else. But the hypocrites do not know that due to their extreme ignorance."
m-1102	"O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, let not your wealth or your children distract you from the worship of Allah and His obedience. And whoever is distracted by his wealth and children from that - then it is those who are deceived in their share of Allah's honor and mercy. And spend, O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger, some of what We have given you in the ways of good, hastening to do so before death comes to one of you and he sees its signs and indications and says regretfully, ""My Lord, why did you not give me respite and postpone my death for a short time so that I could give charity from my wealth and be among the righteous and pious?"" And Allah will not delay a soul when its time of death comes and its life is over. And Allah, the Exalted, is Aware of what you do of good and evil, and He will reward you for that."
m-1103	Allah is far removed from what is not befitting of Him. Everything in the heavens and the earth belongs to Him, glory be to Him, and He has absolute control over everything. To Him belongs the best and most beautiful praise, and He is over all things competent. Allah is the One Who created you from nothingness. Some of you deny His divinity, and some of you believe in Him and act according to His law. He, glory be to Him, is All-Seeing of your deeds. Nothing of them is hidden from Him, and He will reward you for them. Allah created the heavens and the earth with perfect wisdom, and He created you in the best form. To Him is the return on the Day of Resurrection, and He will reward each one according to his deeds. Allah, glory be to Him, knows everything in the heavens and the earth, and He knows what you conceal, O people, among yourselves and what you reveal. Allah is Knowing of what the hearts conceal and what the souls conceal.
m-1104	Has there not come to you, O polytheists, the news of those who disbelieved among the nations before you? When the evil consequences of their disbelief and the evil of their deeds in this world befell them, and for them in the Hereafter is a painful and grievous punishment. That which befell them in this world and what befell them in the Hereafter is because the messengers of God used to come to them with clear signs and evident miracles, but they said, denying, “Shall we bring good tidings like us to guide us?” So they disbelieved in God and denied the message of His messengers and turned away from the truth, so they did not accept it. And God is free of need, and God is free of need, with complete and absolute self-sufficiency. Praiseworthy in His words, deeds, and attributes. He does not care about them, nor does their misguidance harm Him at all.
m-1105	"Those who disbelieve in Allah falsely claim that they will never emerge from their graves after death. Say to them, ""O Messenger, yes, by my Lord, you will surely emerge from your graves alive, then you will be informed of what you did in the world. That, for Allah, is easy and simple."" So believe in Allah and His Messenger, O polytheists, and be guided by the Qur'an that He sent down to His Messenger. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do. Nothing of your deeds and words is hidden from Him, and He will reward you for them on the Day of Resurrection. Remember the Day of Gathering on which Allah will gather the first and the last. That is the Day on which the deception and disparity between creation will appear, and the believers will deceive the disbelievers and the wicked. So the people of faith will enter Paradise by the mercy of Allah, and the people of disbelief will enter the Fire by the justice of Allah. And whoever believes in Allah and acts in obedience to Him, He will erase his sins and admit him to gardens beneath whose palaces rivers flow, to abide therein forever. That is eternity in the gardens. That is the great attainment after which there is no attainment. And those who deny that Allah is the true God and deny the proofs of His Lordship and the evidences of His Divinity with which He sent His Messengers - those are the people of the Fire. They will remain there forever, and what a bad destination they will end up in, which is Hell."
m-1106	Nothing bad happens to anyone except by the permission of Allah, His decree and destiny. Whoever believes in Allah, He guides his heart to submit to His command and be content with His decree and guides him to the best words, deeds and conditions, because the origin of guidance is for the heart and the limbs, and Allah is All-Knowing of everything, nothing of that is hidden from Him. And obey Allah, O people, and submit to Him in what He has commanded and forbidden, and obey the Messenger, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, in what he has conveyed to you from his Lord. If you turn away from obeying Allah and His Messenger, then there is no harm upon our Messenger in your turning away, but he must convey to you what he was sent with in a clear and explicit message. Allah is alone, there is no true deity other than Him, and upon Allah let the believers rely on His Oneness in all their affairs.
m-1107	O you who believe in Allah and His Messenger, indeed, among your wives and your children are enemies to you who avert you from the way of Allah and discourage you from obeying Him. So be on your guard against them and do not obey them. But if you overlook their misdeeds and turn away from them and cover them up, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. He will forgive you your sins, for He is the Great Forgiver, the Vast in Mercy. Your wealth and your children are only a trial and a test for you. And Allah has with Him a great reward for whoever prefers His obedience to the obedience of others and fulfills the right of Allah in his wealth. So, O believers, exert your utmost effort and energy in fearing Allah, and listen to the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with a listening of contemplation and reflection, and obey his commands and avoid his prohibitions, and spend from what Allah has provided for you, it will be better for you. And whoever is free from miserliness and withholding the surplus of wealth - those are the ones who will triumph over every good and will win every goal. If you spend your wealth in the way of Allah with sincerity and good cheer, Allah will multiply the reward for what you have spent and will forgive you your sins. And Allah is Appreciative of the spenders with a good reward for What they spend is Forbearing, and He does not hasten to punish those who disobey Him. He, glory be to Him, is All-Knowing of all that is absent and present, the Mighty, who cannot be overcome by the Wise in His words and deeds.
m-1108	O Prophet, when you and the believers desire to divorce your women, divorce them before their waiting period ends, that is, during a period of purity in which no intercourse has taken place or during an apparent pregnancy. And observe the waiting period so that you may know the time of taking them back if you desire to take them back. And fear Allah, your Lord. Do not turn divorced women out of their houses until their waiting period has expired, which is three menstrual periods for anyone other than a young girl, a woman who has despaired of her husband, or a pregnant woman. It is not permissible for them to leave them by themselves unless they have committed an obvious reprehensible act such as adultery. These are the rulings of Allah which He has prescribed for His servants. And whoever transgresses the rulings of Allah has wronged himself and has brought himself to the point of destruction. You do not know, O divorcer, that Allah may bring about after that divorce something you did not expect, so you may take her back. So when the divorced women are about to end their waiting period, then take them back with good treatment and provision for them, or separate from them while fulfilling their right without harming them. And bring to witness the taking back or separation two just men from among you. And give, O witnesses, the testimony sincerely for Allah, not for anything else. That is what Allah has commanded you. Whoever believes is instructed by it. By Allah and the Last Day. And whoever fears Allah and does what He has commanded him and avoids what He has forbidden him - He will make for him a way out from every distress and will facilitate for him the means of provision from where he did not think or imagine. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He will suffice him in whatever concerns him in all his affairs. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Nothing escapes Him, and nothing that is sought escapes Him. Allah has set for everything a term and a measure which it will not exceed. So when the divorced women are nearing the end of their waiting period, either take them back with good treatment and spending on them, or separate from them, fulfilling their rights without causing them harm. And bring to witness the taking back or separation two just men from among you. And give, O witnesses, testimony sincerely for Allah, not for anything else. That is what Allah has commanded you to do, for whomever believes in Allah and the Last Day is admonished. And whoever fears Allah and does what He has commanded him and avoids what He has forbidden him - He will make for him a way out from every distress and will facilitate for him the means of provision from where he did not think or imagine. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He will suffice him in whatever concerns him in all his affairs. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Nothing escapes Him, and nothing is beyond His ability. God has set a term for everything and a measure that it will not exceed.
m-1109	And divorced women whose menstrual bleeding has stopped due to old age, if you are in doubt and do not know what the ruling is regarding them, then their waiting period is three months. And for young women who have not menstruated, then their waiting period is also three months. And for pregnant women, their waiting period is until they give birth. And whoever fears Allah and carries out His rulings, He will make for him his affair easy in this world and the Hereafter. That which has been mentioned regarding divorce and waiting period is the command of Allah which He has revealed to you, O people, so that you may act upon it. And whoever fears Allah and is mindful of Him by avoiding His disobedience and performing His obligations, He will erase from him his sins and will give him a great reward in the Hereafter and will admit him into Paradise. Accommodate your divorced women during their waiting period like your housing, according to your means and ability. Do not cause them harm by making their dwellings cramped for them. If your divorced women are pregnant, then spend on them during their waiting period until they give birth. And if they breastfeed your children from you for a fee, then give them their wages. And let some of you enjoin upon others what is known of generosity and good nature. And if they do not, then let them be guided by what is known of generosity and good nature. They agree to breastfeed the mother, so another wet nurse will breastfeed the father, other than the divorced mother. The husband should spend from what God has given him on his divorced wife and on his child if the husband has plenty of provisions. And whoever has a tight provision, and he is poor, let him spend from what God has given him of provisions. The poor person is not burdened with what he burdens the rich person. God will make, after hardship and difficulty, plenty and wealth.
m-1110	"And many a town the people of which disobeyed the command of Allah and the command of His Messenger and persisted in their transgression and disbelief, so We brought them to a severe account for their deeds in this world, and punished them with a great and terrible punishment, so they tasted the evil consequence of their transgression and disbelief. And the consequence of their disbelief was destruction and loss after which there is no loss.

And many a town the people of which disobeyed the command of Allah and the command of His Messenger and persisted in their transgression and disbelief, so We brought them to a severe account for their deeds in this world, and punished them with a great and terrible punishment, so they tasted the evil consequence of their transgression and disbelief. And the consequence of their disbelief was destruction and loss after which there is no loss.

Allah has prepared for these people who transgressed and disobeyed His command and the command of His Messengers a punishment of the utmost severity, so fear Allah and beware of His wrath, O people of sound minds who believed in Allah and His Messengers and acted according to His law. Allah has sent down to you, O believers, a reminder to remind you and alert you to your portion of faith in Allah and acting in obedience to Him. This is The Reminder is the Messenger who recites to you the verses of Allah, explaining to you the truth from falsehood, in order that he may bring forth those who believed in Allah and His Messenger and did what Allah commanded them to do and obeyed him from the darkness of disbelief into the light of faith. And whoever believes in Allah and does righteous work, He will admit him to gardens beneath whose trees rivers flow, to abide therein forever. Allah has certainly been good to the righteous believer in Paradise.

Allah has certainly been good to the righteous believer in Paradise. Allah alone is the One Who created seven Heavens and created seven earths and sent down the command from what God revealed to His messengers and what He manages His creation with between the heavens and the earth so that you may know, O people, that God is over all things competent and nothing is beyond His power and that God has encompassed all things in knowledge and nothing is beyond His knowledge and power."
m-1111	O Prophet, why did you prevent yourself from what Allah has made lawful for you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful to you. Allah has prescribed for you, O believers, the expiation of your oaths by feeding ten poor people or clothing them or freeing a slave. But whoever cannot find [anything], then a fast of three days. And Allah is your supporter and the caretaker of your affairs. And He is the Knower of what is best for you. So He legislates for you the Wise in His words and deeds. And when the Prophet confided a matter to his wife Hafsah, may Allah be pleased with her, and when she told Aishah, may Allah be pleased with her, and Allah informed him of her divulging His secret, he informed Hafsah of some of what she had told him and turned away from informing her of some of it out of generosity. So when he told her what she had divulged of the matter, she said, “Who told you this?” He said, “Allah, the Knowing, the Aware, from whom nothing is hidden.” If Hafsah and Aishah return to Allah, then He has found in you that which necessitates repentance, since your hearts have inclined toward loving what the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, hated, which was divulging his secret, and if you cooperate against him in that which would displease him, then Allah is his Guardian and Supporter. Gabriel, the righteous believers, and the angels, after Allah's victory, are His helpers and supporters against those who harm Him and oppose Him. Perhaps his Lord, if he divorces you, O wives, will marry him instead of you wives who are submissive to Allah in obedience, who believe in Allah and His Messenger, who obey Allah, who return to what Allah loves of His obedience, who worship Him often, who fast, some of them are married, and some of them are virgins.
m-1112	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, protect yourselves by doing what Allah has commanded you and leaving what He has forbidden you, and protect your families as you would protect yourselves from a Fire whose fuel is men and stones. Its people are tormented by angels, strong and harsh in their dealings, who do not disobey Allah in His command and carry out what they are commanded to do. And it will be said to those who denied that Allah is the true God and disbelieved in Him when they are brought into the Fire, “Do not seek excuses on this Day. You are only given the recompense of what you used to do in this world.”
m-1113	O you who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and acted according to His law, return from your sins to the obedience of Allah with a return after which there will be no disobedience. Perhaps your Lord will erase from you the evil of your deeds and admit you to gardens beneath whose palaces rivers flow, on the Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him, nor will He punish them, but will exalt their status. The light of these will go before them and on their right hands they will say, “Our Lord, perfect for us our light so that we may cross the Bridge and be guided to Paradise. And pardon us and overlook our sins and conceal them for us. Indeed, You are over all things competent.”
m-1114	O Prophet, strive against those who openly declare disbelief and fight them with the sword. And strive against those who conceal disbelief and hide it with proof and the establishment of the limits and the rituals of religion. And use severity and harshness with both groups in your struggle. And their abode to which they will go in the Hereafter is Hell. How ugly is that destination to which they will return.
m-1115	Allah gave an example of the state of the disbelievers in their mixing with Muslims, their closeness to them, and their association with them, and that this does not benefit them because of their disbelief in Allah, like the wife of the Prophet of Allah Noah and the wife of the Prophet of Allah Lot, who were under the protection of two of our righteous servants, but they betrayed them in religion, for they were disbelievers. These two messengers did not protect their wives from the punishment of Allah at all, and it was said to the two wives, “Enter the Fire with those who enter it.” And in giving this example, there is evidence that being close to the prophets and the righteous does not benefit at all with evil deeds. Allah gave an example of the state of the believers who believed in Allah, worshipped Him alone, and acted according to His law, and that their association with the disbelievers in their dealings does not harm them, like the wife of Pharaoh, who was under the protection of the most severe disbeliever in Allah, and she believed in Allah, when she said, “My Lord, build for me a home near You in Paradise, and save me from the authority of Pharaoh and his temptations, and from the evil deeds that he produces, and save me from the people who follow him in injustice and misguidance, and from their punishment.” And Allah gave an example of those who Believe in Mary, daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity and protected it from adultery. Then God Almighty commanded Gabriel, peace be upon him, to blow into the pocket of her shirt, and the blow reached her womb, so she became pregnant with Jesus, peace be upon him. She believed in the words of her Lord and acted according to His laws that He legislated for His servants and His books that He revealed to His messengers, and she was among those who obeyed Him.
m-1116	The abundance of Allah's goodness and His kindness to all His creation, in whose hand is the kingdom of this world and the Hereafter and their authority, His command and decree are effective in them, and He is over all things competent. The verse proves the attribute of the hand for Allah, the Most High, in a manner befitting His Majesty. He who created death and life to test you, O people, which of you is best in deed and most sincere. He is the Exalted in Might, for whom nothing is beyond His ability, the Forgiving to those of His servants who repent. The verse encourages doing good deeds and warns against committing sins. He who created seven heavens in harmony, one above the other. You do not see in the creation of the Most Gracious, O observer, any difference or disparity. So look again at the sky. Do you see in it any cracks or fissures? Then look again and again. Your sight will return to you humbled and submissive, unable to see any deficiency, while it is tired and exhausted. And We have certainly adorned the near heaven that the eyes see with great, shining stars, and We have made them scorching meteors for those who eavesdrop from among the devils. And We have prepared for them in the Hereafter the punishment of the blazing Fire, whose heat they will suffer.
m-1117	"And for those who disbelieve in their Creator is the punishment of Hell, and an evil return for them is Hell.

When these disbelievers are thrown into Hell, they will hear from it a loud, horrific sound while it boils violently.

Hell almost tears itself apart from the intensity of its wrath upon the disbelievers. Whenever a group of people are thrown into it, those in charge of its affairs will ask them, by way of rebuke, “Did there not come to you in this world a messenger warning you of this punishment that you are in?”

They will answer them, saying, “Yes, a messenger came to us from God and warned us, but we denied him and said, regarding the signs that he brought, ‘God has not sent down anything to any of mankind.’ You, O messengers, are only in a far departure from the truth.”

And they will say, admitting, “If we had listened as one who seeks the truth or thought about what we are called to, we would not have been among the people of the Fire.”

So they will admit their denial and disbelief, for which they deserved the punishment of the Fire. So far away are the people of the Fire from the mercy of God."
m-1118	Those who fear their Lord, worship Him and do not disobey Him while they are absent from the eyes of people, and fear the punishment in the Hereafter before they see it, will have forgiveness from God for their sins and a great reward, which is Paradise.
m-1119	And conceal your speech, O people, in any of your affairs, or declare it, for they are all the same to Allah. Indeed, He is All-Knowing of the secrets of the hearts. How can your words and deeds be hidden from Him? Does not the Lord of the worlds know His creation and their affairs, while He is the One who created them and perfected and made their creation good? He is the Kind to His servants, the Knower of them and their deeds. Allah alone is the One who made the earth easy and smooth for you to settle on, so walk in its regions and sides and eat from the provision of Allah which He brings forth for you from it. And to Him alone is the resurrection from your graves for the reckoning and reward. The verse alludes to seeking provision and earnings, and it indicates that Allah is the only true God, with no partner, and His power, and it reminds us of His blessings and warns us against relying on the world.
m-1120	Do you feel secure, O infidels of Mecca, that Allah, who is above the heaven, will not cause the earth to swallow you up, and then it will shake you up until you perish? Do you feel secure, O infidels of Mecca, that Allah, who is above the heaven, will not send upon you a wind that will pelt you with small stones? Then you will know, O infidels, how My warning to you is when you witness the punishment? Knowledge will not benefit you at that time. In the verse, there is proof of Allah’s loftiness as befits His Majesty, glory be to Him. Do you feel secure, O infidels of Mecca, that Allah, who is above the heaven, will not cause the earth to swallow you up, and then it will shake you up until you perish? Do you feel secure, O infidels of Mecca, that Allah, who is above the heaven, will not send upon you a wind that will pelt you with small stones? Then you will know, O infidels, how My warning to you is when you witness the punishment? Knowledge will not benefit you at that time? In the verse, there is proof of Allah’s loftiness as befits His Majesty, glory be to Him. And those who were before the infidels of Mecca, such as the people of Noah, Aad, and Thamud, denied their messengers. So how was My denial of them and changing the blessing they had by sending down punishment upon them and destroying them? These infidels were heedless and did not look at the birds spreading out their wings above them. Their wings when they fly in the air and sometimes they fold them to their south, which protects them from falling at that time, except for the Most Gracious. Indeed, He is All-Seeing of all things. He does not see any deficiency or disparity in His creation. Rather, who is this who, in your opinion, O disbelievers, is a party for you who supports you other than the Most Gracious if He intends evil for you? The disbelievers, in their opinion, are only in deception and misguidance from Satan. Rather, who is this alleged Provider who provides for you if Allah withholds His provision and prevents it from you? Rather, the disbelievers continue in their transgression and misguidance in obstinacy, arrogance, and aversion to the truth, neither listening to Him nor following Him? These disbelievers neglected and did not look at the birds above them, spreading their wings when they fly in the air and sometimes they fold them to their south, which protects them from falling at that time, except for the Most Gracious.

Rather, who is this one who, in your claim, O disbelievers, is a party for you who supports you other than the Most Gracious if He intends evil for you? The disbelievers, in their claim, are only deceived and misled by Satan. Rather, who is this alleged Provider who provides for you if Allah withholds His provision and prevents it from you? Rather, the disbelievers continue in their transgression and misguidance, in obstinacy, arrogance, and aversion to the truth, not listening to Him nor following Him. Is he who walks upside down on his face, not knowing where to go or how to go, more upright on the path and better guided than he who walks straight, erect, safe on a clear path with no There is a crookedness in it, and this is an example that God has given to the disbeliever and the believer. Say to them, O Messenger, God is the One who created you from nothingness and gave you hearing that you may hear with it, and sight that you may see with it, and hearts that you may understand with it. Little do you, O disbelievers, give thanks for these blessings to your Lord who has bestowed them upon you? Say to them, God is the One who created you and spread you on the earth, and to Him alone you will be gathered after this dispersion for the reckoning and recompense.
m-1121	"Say to them, O Messenger, ""It is Allah who created you from nothingness and gave you hearing that you may hear with it, and sight that you may see with it, and hearts that you may understand with it. Little do you, O disbelievers, give thanks for these blessings to your Lord who has bestowed them upon you?"" Say to them, ""It is Allah who created you and spread you on the earth, and to Him alone you will be gathered after this dispersion for the reckoning and recompense."" The disbelievers say, ""When will this promise of the gathering be fulfilled, O Muhammad? Tell us when it will be, O believers, if you are truthful in what you claim."" Say, O Messenger, to these people, ""The knowledge of the time of the Hour is reserved for Allah, and I am only a warner to you, frightening you with the consequences of your disbelief, and explaining to you what Allah has commanded me to explain with the utmost clarity."" The disbelievers say, ""When will this promise of the gathering be fulfilled, O Muhammad? Tell us when it will be, O believers, if you are truthful in what you claim."" Say, O Messenger, to these people, ""The knowledge of the time of the Hour is reserved for Allah, and I am only a warner to you, frightening you with the consequences of your disbelief, and explaining to you what Allah has commanded me to explain with the utmost clarity."" So when the disbelievers saw the punishment of Allah approaching them and witnessed it, it became clear to them. Humiliation and gloom on their faces, and it was said to them as a rebuke: This is what you were asking to hasten in this world."
m-1122	Say, O Messenger, to these disbelievers, “Tell me: If Allah should cause me and those with me of the believers to die as you wish, or have mercy on us and delay our terms and save us from His punishment, then who is it that will protect you and prevent you from a painful and grievous punishment?” Say, “Allah is the Most Gracious. We have believed in Him and acted according to His law and obeyed Him, and upon Him alone we have relied in all our affairs. Then you will know, O disbelievers, when the punishment descends, which of the two groups, us and you, is clearly far from the straight path of Allah.” Say, O Messenger, to these polytheists, “Tell me: If the water you drink were to go into the earth and you could not reach it by any means, then who other than Allah could bring you running water, visible to the eyes, on the surface of the earth?”
m-1123	"We have previously spoken about the disconnected letters at the beginning of Surat Al-Baqarah. Allah swears by the pen with which the angels and people write, and by what they write of good, benefit, and knowledge, that you, O Messenger, are not, because of Allah’s blessing upon you with prophethood and the message, weak-minded or foolish in opinion.

Allah swears by the pen with which the angels and people write, and by what they write of good, benefit, and knowledge, that you, O Messenger, are not, because of Allah’s blessing upon you with prophethood and the message, weak in mind or foolish in opinion. And for what you encounter of hardships in conveying the message, you will have a great reward, not diminished or cut off. And for what you encounter of good morals in the Qur’an, you will have a great reward, not diminished or cut off. And for what you encounter of good morals in the Qur’an, you will have a great character. Morals: He was naturally inclined to obey the Qur’an, obeying its commands and refraining from what it forbade."

m-1125	"We tested the people of Mecca with hunger and famine, just as We tested the owners of the garden when they swore among themselves to cut the fruits of their garden early in the morning so that no one else, the poor, would eat from it, and they did not say, “God willing.” So God sent down a fire upon it that burned it at night while they were asleep, and it became scorched and black like a dark night. So some of them called out to others in the morning, “Go early to your crops if you insist on cutting the fruits.” So they rushed out, whispering to each other, “Do not allow any of the poor to enter your garden today.” They rushed quickly, discussing among themselves that they should not allow any of the poor to enter your garden today. They went early in the morning to their garden, with their evil intention of preventing the poor from the fruits of the garden, which they claimed to be able to implement. When they saw their garden burned, they denied it and said, “We have made a mistake in our way to it.” When they realized that it was their garden, they said, “Rather, we are deprived of its goodness because of our determination to be stingy and to prevent the poor.” The most just of them said, “Did I not tell you, why don’t you make an exception and say, ‘If God wills?’” They said, after they had come to their senses, “God, our Lord, is far above injustice in what has befallen us. Rather, we were the wrongdoers to ourselves by leaving the exception and our evil intention.” Then some of them turned to one another, blaming each other for leaving the exception and for their evil intention. They said, “Woe to us! We were overstepping the bounds in preventing the poor and disobeying God’s command. Perhaps our Lord will give us something better than our garden because of our repentance and our confession of our sin. Indeed, we are desirous of our Lord alone, hoping for forgiveness and seeking goodness, like that punishment which We punished the people of the garden with it. Our punishment in this world will be for everyone who disobeyed the command of Allah and was miserly with what Allah gave him of blessings and did not fulfill Allah’s right in it. The punishment of the Hereafter is greater and more severe than the punishment of this world. If they only knew, they would have been deterred from every reason that necessitated punishment. When they saw their garden burned, they denied it and said, “We have lost our way to it.” But when they realized that it was their garden, they said, “Rather, we are deprived of its good because of our determination to be miserly and to prevent the poor.” The most just of them said, “Did I not tell you, ‘Why do you not make an exception and say, ‘Inshallah?’” They said, after they had come to their senses, “Allah, our Lord, is far above injustice in what befell us.

m-1127	"On the Day of Resurrection, the matter will be intense and its terror will be difficult, and Allah, the Most High, will come to decide the judgment among the creatures. He will uncover His noble leg, which is unlike anything else. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said, “Our Lord will uncover His leg, and every believing man and woman will prostrate to Him. Whoever used to prostrate in this world out of hypocrisy and to be heard will remain. He will go to prostrate, but his back will return to being flat.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim
Their eyes will be downcast, they will not raise them. Severe humiliation from Allah’s punishment will overwhelm them. In this world, they were called to prayer and worship of Allah while they were healthy and able to do so, but they will not prostrate out of arrogance and haughtiness.
So leave Me, O Messenger, and whoever denies this Qur’an, for indeed, I am responsible for their recompense and vengeance.

If Muhammad had claimed against us something that we did not say, we would have taken revenge and seized him by the right hand, then we would have cut off the ties of his heart, and none of you would be able to prevent our punishment from him.

Indeed, we know that among you are those who deny this Qur’an, despite the clarity of its verses. And indeed, denying it is a great regret for the disbelievers in it when they see their punishment and see the bliss of the believers in it. Indeed, it is a firm truth and a certainty in which there is no doubt. So, purify God, glory be to Him, from what is not befitting of His majesty, and mention Him by His great name.

The leaders of misguidance plotted against their weak followers with a great plot, and they said to them: ‘Do not abandon the worship of your gods for the worship of God alone, to which Noah called, and do not abandon Wadd, nor Suwa’, nor Yaghuth, nor Ya’uq, nor Nasr.’ These were the names of their idols that they worshipped instead of God, and they were the names of righteous men. When they died, Satan inspired their people to erect statues and pictures for them, so that they would be encouraged, according to their claim, to obey when they saw them. When these people left and time passed and others succeeded them, Satan whispered to them that their ancestors used to worship statues and pictures and seek intercession through them. This is the wisdom behind the prohibition of statues and the prohibition of building domes over graves, because with the passage of time they become objects of worship for the ignorant. These followers have led many people astray with the paths of misguidance and misguidance that they have adorned for them.

m-1146	"Say, O Messenger, Allah has revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened to my recitation of the Qur’an. When they heard it, they said to their people, “Indeed, we have heard a Qur’an that is wondrous in its eloquence, clarity, wisdom, rulings, and news. It calls to the truth and guidance. So we believe in this Qur’an and act upon it. We will never associate with our Lord, who created us, anyone in His worship.” Say, O Messenger, Allah has revealed to me that a group of the jinn listened to my recitation of the Qur’an. When they heard it, they said to their people, “Indeed, we have heard a Qur’an that is wondrous in its eloquence, clarity, wisdom, rulings, and news. It calls to the truth and guidance. So we believe in this Qur’an and act upon it. We will never associate with our Lord, who created us, anyone in His worship.” And that the greatness and majesty of our Lord is exalted. He has not taken a wife or a son. And that our fool, Iblis, used to say about Allah the Most High a statement far from the truth and correctness, claiming that He has a wife and a son. And we think that no one will lie about Allah the Most High, neither from mankind nor from the jinn, regarding the attribution of a wife or a son. To Him
And that there were men from among mankind who sought refuge with men from among the jinn, so the men of the jinn increased the fear, terror and terror of mankind by seeking refuge with them. And this seeking refuge with other than God, which God condemned for the people of ignorance, is from the greatest polytheism that God does not forgive except with sincere repentance from it. And in the verse is a severe warning against resorting to magicians, sorcerers and the like.
And that the disbelievers among mankind thought, as you thought, O group of jinn, that God Almighty will not resurrect anyone after death."
m-1147	We, the jinn, sought to reach the sky to hear the speech of its people, but we found it filled with many angels guarding it and with burning meteors that are thrown at anyone who approaches it. Before that, we used to take places in the sky to listen to its news. Whoever now tries to eavesdrop will find a meteor lying in wait to burn and destroy him. In these two verses, the claims of magicians and sorcerers who claim to know the unseen and deceive the weak-minded with their lies and fabrications are refuted. We, the jinn, do not know whether God intended to send down evil upon the people of the earth or whether He intended good and guidance for them. Among us are the righteous and pious, and among us are people who are less than that, infidels and wicked. We were different groups and sects. We were certain that God is able to do something to us, and that we are in His grip and authority, so we will not escape from Him if He intends something for us wherever we are, and we will not be able to escape His punishment by fleeing to the sky if He intends evil for us. When we heard the Qur’an, we believed in it and acknowledged that it is the truth from God. So whoever believes in his Lord, then he will not be He fears a decrease in his good deeds, nor injustice that will be inflicted on him by an increase in his bad deeds.
m-1148	And among us are those who submit to Allah through obedience, and among us are the unjust and oppressors who have deviated from the path of truth. So whoever submits and submits to Allah through obedience, then those are the ones who intended the path of truth and rightness and strove to choose it, so Allah guided them to it. As for those who deviate from the path of Islam, they are fuel for Hell. And if the disbelievers from mankind and jinn had followed the path of Islam and not deviated from it, We would have sent down upon them abundant water and expanded their provision in this world to test them how they would be grateful for Allah’s blessings upon them. And whoever turns away from obeying his Lord and listening to the Qur’an and pondering it and acting upon it, He will put him into a severe and difficult punishment. And if the disbelievers from mankind and jinn had followed the path of Islam and not deviated from it, We would have sent down upon them abundant water and expanded their provision in this world. To test them how they thank God for His blessings upon them. And whoever turns away from obeying his Lord, listening to the Qur’an, contemplating it, and acting upon it, He will put him into a severe and difficult punishment.
m-1149	"And that the mosques are for the worship of Allah alone, so do not worship anyone other than Him in them, and devote supplication and worship to Him in them, for the mosques were not built except for Allah alone to be worshipped in them without anyone else. In this is the obligation to purify the mosques from everything that taints sincerity to Allah and following His Messenger Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And that when Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, stood up to worship his Lord, the jinn almost formed groups around him, one on top of the other, from the intensity of their crowding to hear the Qur’an from him. Say, O Messenger, to these infidels, “I only worship my Lord alone, and I do not associate anyone with Him in worship.” Say, O Messenger, to them, “I am not able to ward off harm from you, nor to bring you any benefit.” Say, “No one can save me from the punishment of Allah if I disobey Him, and I will not find besides Him a refuge to which I can flee from His punishment. But I have the power to convey to you from Allah what He has commanded me to convey to you, and His message with which He has sent me to you. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and turns away from the religion of Allah, then his recompense is the fire of Hell, from which he will never emerge.” Say, O Messenger, to them, “I am not able to I ward off harm from you, nor can I bring you any benefit. Say, ""None can save me from the punishment of Allah if I disobey Him, nor can I find besides Him any refuge to which I can flee from His punishment. But I have the power to convey to you from Allah what He has commanded me to convey to you, and His message with which He has sent me to you.

m-1154	Your Lord, O Prophet, knows that you stand for the night prayer for less than two-thirds of the night, and sometimes you stand for half of it, and sometimes you stand for a third of it, and a group of your companions stand with you. And God alone is the One who measures the night and the day and knows their proportions and what passes and what remains of them. God knows that you cannot stand the whole night, so He made it easy for you. So recite in the prayer at night whatever you can recite of the Qur’an. God knows that there will be among you those who are unable to stand in the night prayer due to illness, and there will be other people who move around the earth for trade and work, seeking from God’s lawful provision, and other people who strive in the way of God to make His word supreme and spread His religion. So recite in your prayers whatever you can of the Qur’an, and be consistent in the obligatory prayers, and give the obligatory zakat, and give charity from your wealth in charitable and benevolent ways, seeking the face of God. Whatever you do of charitable and good deeds and acts of obedience, you will receive its reward and recompense from God on the Day of Resurrection, better than what you did in this world and greater in reward. And seek God’s forgiveness in all your circumstances, for God is Forgiving and Merciful to you.

m-1243	"Indeed, We sent down the Qur’an on the Night of Honor and Virtue, which is one of the nights of the month of Ramadan.

And what do you know, O Prophet, about the Night of Decree and honor?

The Night of Decree is a blessed night, its virtue is better than the virtue of a thousand months in which there is no Night of Decree.

The angels and Gabriel, peace be upon him, descend frequently in it by permission of their Lord for every matter that He has decreed in that year.

It is all peaceful, with no evil in it until the break of dawn."
m-1244	The disbelievers among the Jews, Christians and polytheists would not abandon their disbelief until there came to them the sign which they were promised in the previous Scriptures. It is the Messenger of God, Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, reciting a Qur’an in purified pages. In those pages are true news and just commands that guide to the truth and to a straight path. And the people who were given the Scripture among the Jews and Christians did not differ about whether Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, was a true Messenger because of what they found of his description in their Scripture except after they had made clear that he was the Prophet whom they were promised in the Torah and the Gospel. So they were united in the truth of his prophethood. Then when he was sent, they denied it and dispersed. And they were not commanded in all the other laws except to worship God alone, intending in their worship His face, inclining from polytheism to faith, and to establish prayer and pay zakat. And that is the religion of uprightness, which is Islam.
m-1245	Indeed, those who disbelieved among the Jews, Christians, and polytheists - their punishment is the Fire of Hell, wherein they will abide eternally. Those are the most evil of creation. Indeed, those who believed in Allah and followed His Messenger and did righteous deeds - those are the best of creation. Their reward with their Lord on the Day of Resurrection will be gardens of abode and settlement in the utmost beauty, beneath whose palaces rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. Allah is pleased with them, so He accepted their righteous deeds and they were pleased with Him for what He has prepared for them of various honors. That is the best reward for whoever fears Allah and avoids His disobedience.
m-1246	"If the earth shakes violently and brings out what is in its belly of dead people and treasures, and man wonders in fear what happened to it

If the earth shakes violently and brings out what is in its belly of dead people and treasures, and man wonders in fear what happened to it

If the earth shakes violently and brings out what is in its belly of dead people and treasures, and man wonders in fear what happened to it

On the Day of Resurrection, the earth will tell what was done on it of good or evil, and that Allah, the Most High, commanded it to tell what was done on it
On the Day of Resurrection, the earth will tell what was done on it of good or evil, and that Allah, the Most High, commanded it to tell what was done on it
On that Day, people will return from the place of reckoning in different groups so that Allah may show them what they did of bad and good deeds and reward them for them
So whoever does good the weight of a small ant will see his reward in the Hereafter, and whoever does evil the weight of a small ant will see his punishment in the Hereafter
So whoever does good the weight of a small ant will see his reward in the Hereafter, and whoever does evil the weight of a small ant will see his punishment in the Hereafter

So whoever does good the weight of a small ant will see his reward in the Hereafter, and whoever does evil the weight of a small ant will see his punishment in the Hereafter A small ant is evil and will be punished in the afterlife."
m-1247	God Almighty swears by the horses running in His path towards the enemy when their sound is heard from the speed of their running. It is not permissible for a creature to swear except by God, for swearing by other than God is polytheism. The horses whose hooves spark fire from the hardness of their running. The ones who attack the enemies at dawn. They stir up dust with this running. They ride in the middle of the crowds of enemies.

Indeed, man is ungrateful for the favors of his Lord, and indeed, he is indeed confessing to his denial. Indeed, he is indeed intense in his love of wealth.

Does man not know what awaits him when Allah brings the dead forth from the graves for reckoning and recompense?

And brings out whatever good or evil is hidden in the hearts?

Indeed, their Lord is All-Aware of them and of their deeds that Day. Nothing of that is hidden from Him."
m-1249	"The Hour that will strike the hearts of people with its terrors

What is this striking thing?

And what can I tell you about it?

On that day, people will be in their multitude, dispersion, and movement like scattered moths that fall into the fire.

And the mountains will be like multi-colored wool that is fluffed by hand and becomes dust and disappears."
m-1250	As for he whose good deeds are more than his due, he will be in a life of satisfaction in Paradise. As for he whose good deeds are more than his due, he will be in a life of satisfaction in Paradise. As for he whose good deeds are less than his due, his abode will be Hell. As for he whose good deeds are less than his due, his abode will be Hell. And what will make you know, O Messenger, what this abyss is? It is a fire heated with fuel.
m-1251	You were distracted from obeying Allah by boasting about your wealth and children. You continued to be busy with that until you reached the graves and were buried in them. This is not how you should be distracted by the accumulation of wealth. You will soon realize that the Hereafter is better for you. Then beware, you will know the evil consequences of your being distracted from it.
m-1252	This is not how the accumulation of wealth should distract you. If you knew the truth, you would be deterred and would rush to save yourselves from destruction. You will see Hell, then you will see it without a doubt. Then you will be asked on the Day of Resurrection about all kinds of pleasures.

God swears by time that the children of Adam are in perdition and decline. It is not permissible for a servant to swear except by God, for swearing by other than God is polytheism. Except for those who believe in God and do righteous deeds and advise one another to hold fast to the truth and to obey God and to be patient in that.
m-1254	"Evil and destruction for every backbiter and slanderer of people

The one whose concern was to collect and count wealth

He thinks that with this wealth he has collected he has guaranteed himself immortality in this world and escape from accountability

The matter is not as he thought. He will be thrown into the fire that crushes everything that is thrown into it

And what do you know, O Messenger, what the reality of fire is?

It is the ignited fire of Allah which, due to its intensity, penetrates from bodies to hearts

It is the ignited fire of Allah which, due to its intensity, penetrates from bodies to hearts

It is encircled over them in chains and long shackles so that they cannot get out of it

It is encircled over them in chains and long shackles so that they cannot get out of it"
m-1255	Did you not know, O Messenger, how your Lord dealt with the owners of the elephant, Abraha the Abyssinian, and his army, who wanted to destroy the blessed Kaaba? Did He not make their evil plan null and void? And He sent against them birds in successive groups, pelting them with stones of hardened clay. And He sent against them birds in successive groups, pelting them with stones of hardened clay. And He made them thereby shattered like the dry leaves of a plant that the animals have eaten and then thrown away.
m-1256	"Marvel at the unity of the Quraysh, their security, the integrity of their interests, the regularity of their two journeys in the winter to Yemen and in the summer to Syria, and the facilitation of that to bring what they need.

So let them thank and worship the Lord of this House, which is the Kaaba, with which they have been honored, and let them unify Him and devote worship to Him

Who fed them from severe hunger and made them safe from great terror and fear."
m-1257	Have you seen the state of the one who denies the resurrection and the reward? He is the one who violently and harshly repels the orphan from his right due to the hardness of his heart. He does not urge others to feed the poor, so how can he feed him himself?
m-1258	So severe is the punishment for those who pray, who are heedless of their prayers, who do not establish them properly nor perform them on time. Those who pretend to do good deeds to show off to people, and who refuse to lend utensils and other things that do not cause harm. So they neither worship their Lord well, nor do they do good to His creation.
m-1259	Indeed, We have given you, O Prophet, much good in this world and the Hereafter, including the River of Kauthar in Paradise, whose banks are pavilions of hollow pearls and whose clay is musk. So, devote all your prayers to your Lord and sacrifice your sacrifice to Him and in His name alone. Indeed, the one who hates you and the one who hates the guidance and light that you have brought is the one whose trace is cut off and who is cut off from all good.
m-1260	"Say, O Messenger, to those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messenger: O you who disbelieve in Allah!

I do not worship what you worship of idols and false gods.

Nor will you worship what I worship of the One God, He is Allah, Lord of the worlds, the only One deserving of worship.

Nor will I worship what you worship of idols and false gods.

Nor will you worship in the future what I worship. This verse was revealed regarding specific individuals from the polytheists. Allah knows that they will never believe.

For you is your religion which you insist on following, and for me is my religion which I seek no other."
m-1261	If you, O Messenger, are victorious over the infidels of Quraish and you conquer Mecca and you see many people entering Islam in groups, if that happens then prepare to meet your Lord by increasing your glorification of Him and increasing your seeking of His forgiveness. He is the Forgiving of those who glorify Him and seek His forgiveness. He accepts their repentance, has mercy on them, and accepts their repentance.
m-1262	"Abu Lahab's hands and his wretchedness were lost because of his harming the Messenger of Allah, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Abu Lahab's loss has been realized.

His wealth and children did not avail him anything, for they will not repel from him any of Allah's punishment when it descends upon him.

He and his wife who carried thorns and threw them in the path of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to harm him will enter a blazing fire.

He and his wife who carried thorns and threw them in the path of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to harm him will enter a blazing fire.

A tight-knit rope of strong, coarse fiber is around her neck, with which she will be lifted into the fire of Hell, then thrown to the bottom."
m-1263	Say, O Messenger, He is God, the One, the Unique in Divinity, Lordship, Names, and Attributes. No one shares them with Him. God alone is the one sought in fulfilling needs and desires. He has no son, no father, no wife. He has no equal or resemblance to any of His creation, neither in His names, nor in His attributes, nor in His actions. Blessed and Exalted be He, and sanctified be He.
m-1264	"Say, O Messenger, I seek refuge and hold fast to the Lord of the daybreak, which is the dawn

From the evil of all creatures and their harm

And from the evil of a very dark night when it enters and penetrates and what is in it of evils and harms

And from the evil of witches who blow on the knots they tie with the intention of magic

And from the evil of an envious person who hates people when he envies them for the blessings that God has given them and wants to take them away from them and inflict harm on them"
m-1265	"Say, O Messenger, I seek refuge and hold fast to the Lord of mankind, the One who alone is able to repel the evil of whisperers
The King of mankind, Who controls all their affairs, Who is independent of them
The God of mankind, other than whom there is no true deity
From the harm of Satan, who whispers when people are heedless and disappears when God is mentioned
Who spreads evil and doubts in the hearts of people
From the devils of the jinn and mankind"
j-0000	"""In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful""

""Praise be to God"" is a declarative sentence intended to praise God with its content that He, the Most High, is the Owner of all praise from creation or deserves to be praised by them, and God is the knowledge of the one truly worshipped. ""Lord of the Worlds"" means the Owner of all creation from mankind, jinn, angels, beasts, and others, and each of them is called a scholar. It is said the scholar of mankind and the scholar of jinn, and so on. The people of knowledge are more likely to be pluralized with the letter ""ya"" and ""noon"" than others, and it is from the sign because it is a sign of its Creator.

""The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"" means the Possessor of mercy, which is the will of good for its people.

That is, the reward, which is the Day of Resurrection. It was specifically mentioned because there is no apparent ownership in it for anyone except God, the Most High, as evidenced by ""To whom belongs the kingdom today, to God"", and whoever reads ""Malik"" means the whole matter on the Day of Resurrection, or He is always described as such. ""Like the Forgiver of sin"", so it is correct that it occurs as an attribute of knowledge."
j-0001	“You alone do we worship, and You alone do we ask for help” meaning we single you out for worship, whether it is monotheism or otherwise, and we ask for help in worship and other things. “Guide us to the straight path” meaning guide us to it. It is replaced by
j-0002	“The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor” with guidance. He substitutes for those connected to it “not those with whom You are angry” and they are the Jews “nor” and “not those who have gone astray” and they are the Christians. The point of the substitute is to indicate that the guided ones are not Jews or Christians. And God knows best what is correct, and to Him is the return and the destination. And may God’s prayers and peace be upon our master Muhammad and his family and companions, and may God’s prayers and peace be upon them abundantly, always and forever. And God is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs. There is no power or strength except with God, the Most High, the Almighty.
j-0003	"""Alif, Lam, Meem."" God knows best what He meant by that. ""That"" meaning this ""Book"" that Muhammad reads ""there is no doubt"" no doubt ""about it"" that it is from God. The negative sentence is the predicate of its subject, that, and the reference to it is for emphasis. ""A guidance"" is a second predicate, meaning a guide ""for those who fear God"" who move towards piety by obeying the commands and avoiding the prohibitions in order to protect themselves from the Fire thereby."
j-0004	"“Those who believe” believe “in the unseen” in what is hidden from them of resurrection, Paradise and Hell “and establish prayer” that is, perform it with its due rights “and spend out of what We have provided for them” that We have given them “and who believe in what has been revealed to you” that is, the Qur’an “and what was revealed before you” that is, the Torah, the Gospel and others “and of the Hereafter they are certain” that is, they know

“Those” described by what was mentioned “are upon guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful” the winners of Paradise and the survivors of Hell."
j-0005	“Indeed, those who disbelieve” such as Abu Jahl, Abu Lahab, and others like them “it is all the same to them whether you warn them” by realizing the two hamzas and replacing the second with an alif and making it easy and inserting an alif between the easy and the other and leaving it out “or you do not warn them - they will not believe” because God knows that about them, so do not hope for their belief, and warning is information with fear. “God has set a seal upon their hearts” He has imprinted on them and made them secure so that no good enters them “and upon their hearing” meaning its places so they do not benefit from what they hear of the truth “and over their eyes is a covering” a covering so they do not see the truth “and for them is a great punishment” strong and permanent.
j-0006	"And it was revealed about the hypocrites: “And among the people is he who says, ‘We believe in God and the Last Day,’” meaning the Day of Resurrection because it is the last of the days, “but they are not believers.” The meaning of “from” was taken into account in it, and in the pronoun it says, “They deceive God and those who believe,” by showing the opposite of what they concealed of disbelief in order to ward off His worldly rulings from them, “but they deceive none but themselves,” because the consequences of their deception will return to them, so they will be disgraced in this world by God informing His Prophet of what they concealed, and they will be punished in the Hereafter, “and they perceive not,” they know that their deception is of themselves, and deception here is from one, like the punishment of the thief, and the mention of God in it is an improvement, and in the reading of “and they do not deceive,” “In their hearts is a disease,” doubt and hypocrisy, so it makes their hearts sick, meaning it weakens them, “so God has increased their disease,” with what He revealed of the Qur’an because of their disbelief in it, “and for them is a painful punishment,” painful, “because they used to lie,” with emphasis, meaning the Prophet of God, and with emphasis, meaning their saying, “We believe.” “And when it is said to them,” meaning to these people, “Do not cause corruption on the earth,” with disbelief and hindering from faith. ""They said, 'We are only reformers,'"" and what we are in is not corruption. God Almighty said in response to them. ""Unquestionably,"" to warn, ""it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive not."" ""And when it is said to them, 'Believe as the people have believed,'"" the companions of the Prophet, ""they say, 'Shall we believe as the fools have believed?'"" the ignorant ones, meaning we should not do as they did. God Almighty said in response to them, ""Unquestionably, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know."" ""And when they meet,"" its original form is liqaywa, the dammah was deleted due to the heaviness, then the ya' because it meets the waw, silent, ""those who believe, they say, 'We believe.' But when they are alone,"" from them and return, ""to their devils,"" their leaders, ""they say, 'Indeed, we are with you,' in religion, ""we were only mocking,"" at them for showing faith. ""God mocks them,"" He punishes them for their mockery, ""and prolongs them,"" He gives them respite, ""in their transgression,"" in their transgression by disbelief, ""while they wander blindly,"" they hesitate in confusion. ""Those are the ones who have purchased error for guidance,"" meaning they exchanged it for it, ""so what Their trade has been profitable” meaning they did not profit from it, but rather they lost, as they were destined for eternal Hellfire. “And they were not guided” in what they did."
j-0007	"“Their example” their description in their hypocrisy “is like the example of one who kindled” kindled “a fire” in darkness “and when it illuminated” illuminated “what was around him” so he saw and was warmed and felt safe from what he feared “Allah took away their light” extinguished it and the pronoun is plural in consideration of the meaning of “who” “and left them in darknesses, not seeing” what was around them, confused about the path and afraid. So likewise these people believed by showing the word of faith, so when they died fear and punishment came to them. They are “deaf” to the truth so they do not hear it with acceptance “dumb” dumb to good so they do not say it “blind” to the path of guidance so they do not see it “so they do not return” from misguidance “or” their example “like a downpour” that is, like the people of rain, and its root is “downpour” from “saba” which means it descends “from the sky” the clouds “in it” that is the clouds “there is darkness” dense “and thunder” that is the angel assigned to it and it was said that it is his voice “and lightning” the brightness of his voice with which he rebukes him “they make” that is, the people of the downpour ""Their fingers"" meaning their fingertips ""are in their ears from"" for ""the thunderbolts"" the intensity of the sound of thunder so that they do not hear it ""wary"" fear of ""death"" from hearing it. Likewise, when the Qur'an is revealed and it contains mention of disbelief likened to darkness and the threat against it likened to thunder and clear arguments likened to lightning, they close their ears so that they do not hear it and are inclined to believe and abandon their religion, which in their view is death. ""And God encompasses the disbelievers"" with knowledge and power, so they do not escape Him. ""The lightning almost snatches away their sight"" by taking it quickly. ""Whenever it lights up for them, they walk in it"" meaning in its light. ""And when darkness covers them, they stand still"" they stop, as a representation of the disturbance of what is in the Qur'an of arguments in their hearts and their belief in what they heard in it of what they love and their stopping from what they hate. ""And if God had willed, He could have taken away their hearing"" meaning their hearing ""and their sight"" the apparent as He took away the hidden. ""Indeed, God is over all things"" He willed it ""powerful"" and from this is the taking away of what was mentioned."
j-0008	“O mankind,” that is, the people of Mecca, “worship,” worship alone, “your Lord who created you,” brought you into being when you were nothing, “and” created “those before you that you may become righteous,” through worshipping Him, from His punishment. Perhaps in the original there is hope, and in His words, the Most High, there is confirmation. “Who has made,” created, “for you the earth as a bed,” a state of a carpet that is spread out, not extremely hard or soft so that it is not possible to settle on it, “and the sky as a structure,” a roof, “and sent down from the sky water and brought forth thereby from,” various kinds, “fruits as provision for you,” that you may eat and feed your animals. “So do not make equals to God,” partners in worship, “while you know,” that He is the Creator and you do not create, and there is no god except He who creates.
j-0009	“And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down to Our servant” Muhammad of the Qur’an that it is from God “then produce a surah like it” that is, the one sent down, and “min” is for clarification, that is, it is like it in eloquence, beauty of composition, and reporting of the unseen. The surah is a section that has a beginning and an end, and its minimum is three verses “and call upon your witnesses, your gods whom you worship” besides God” that is, other than Him, to help you “if you should be truthful” that Muhammad said it from himself, then do that, for you are eloquent Arabs like him. And when they were unable to do that, God Almighty said “But if you do not” what was mentioned because of your inability “and you will never do” that because its miraculous nature is evident, an objection “then fear” by believing in God and that it is not the speech of humans “the Fire whose fuel is men” the disbelievers “and stones” like their idols, meaning that it is extremely hot and burns with what was mentioned, not like the fire of this world that burns with wood and the like “prepared” prepared “for the disbelievers” they will be tormented with it, a new sentence or a necessary condition
j-0010	“And give good tidings” He informed “those who believed” who believed in God “and did righteous deeds” of the obligatory and voluntary acts “that” that is, that “they will have gardens” gardens with trees and dwellings “underneath which” that is, beneath their trees and palaces “rivers flow” that is, beneath their trees and palaces, and the river is the place where the water flows because the water flows it, that is, digs it, and attributing the flow to it is a metaphor. “Whenever they are provided with fruit from it” they are fed from those gardens “as provision, they will say, ‘This is what’ that is, like what “we were provided with before’ that is, before it in Paradise because its fruits are similar according to the context. “And they will be brought with it” that is, they will be brought with provision “in resemblance” that is, some of it resembles others in color but differs in taste. “And they will have therein spouses” of houris and others “purified” from menstruation and all impurity “and they will abide therein eternally” they will not perish or leave. It was revealed in response to the statement of the Jews when God gave the example of the fly in His statement, “And if the fly should steal from them something” and the spider in His statement, “Like the example of the spider.” God did not mean by mentioning these things. The vile one, so God revealed
j-0011	“Allah is not ashamed to set forth” makes “an example” the first object “what” an indefinite noun described by what follows it as a second object, i.e. “like” was or an extra word to emphasize baseness, so what follows it is the second object “of a mosquito” the singular of “gnats” which is a small insect “or what is above it” i.e. bigger than it, i.e. He does not leave its explanation because of the ruling in it “As for those who believe, they know that it” i.e. the example “is the truth” the established and established in its place “from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, “What did Allah intend by this example?” a specification, i.e. by this example, and “what” is an interrogative of denial, a subject, and “that” in the sense of what is connected to it is its predicate, i.e. what is the benefit in it. Allah the Most High said in their response “He misleads thereby” i.e. by this example “many” from the truth because of their disbelief in it “and guides thereby many” of the believers because of their belief in it “and He misleads thereby only the wicked” those who go against His obedience “who” an adjective “break the covenant of Allah” what He has covenanted with them in the books of belief in Muhammad “after its ratification” to emphasize it upon them “and sever what Allah has commanded” “That he may connect” from faith in the Prophet and the womb and other than that, and “that” is a substitute for the pronoun “with it” “and they cause corruption on the earth” with sins and obstruction from faith “those” described by what was mentioned “are the losers” because of their destiny to the eternal fire upon them
j-0012	“How can you disbelieve in God, O people of Mecca, when you were dead, sperm in the loins, and He gave you life, in the wombs and in this world by breathing the spirit into you? The question is to express astonishment at their disbelief despite the proof being established or to rebuke them. “Then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you to life, through resurrection, then to Him you will be returned.” You will be returned after the resurrection, and He will reward you for your deeds. He said, as evidence of the resurrection when they denied it, “It is He who created for you whatever is on the earth, all together, so that you may benefit from it and take heed. “Then He directed Himself, after creating the earth, that is, He intended, to the heaven and proportioned them, the pronoun refers to the heaven because it is in the sense of a plural that returns to Him, that is, He made it, as in another verse, “so He ordained them, seven heavens, and He is Knowing of all things,” in summary and detail. Do you not consider that the One who is able to create that from the beginning, and He is greater than you, is able to bring you back?”
j-0013	"“And” remember, O Muhammad, “when your Lord said to the angels, “Indeed, I am placing upon the earth a successor,” who will succeed me in implementing My rulings therein, and he is Adam. “They said, ‘Will You place upon it one who will cause corruption therein’” with sins “and shed blood’” who will shed it by killing as the sons of the jinn did when they were there, and when they caused corruption, God sent upon them the angels who expelled them to the islands and mountains “while we glorify” wearing “Your praise” that is, we say, “Glory be to God and His praise” “and sanctify You” we declare You to be workers befitting You, so the lam is redundant and the clause is a state, meaning we are more deserving of the succession. “He” the Most High said, “Indeed, I know that which you do not know” of the benefit in making Adam a successor and that his descendants include the obedient and the disobedient, so justice will appear between them. They said, “Our Lord will never create a creation more honorable to Him than us, and I do not know because of our precedence over Him and our seeing what He did not see.” So God created Adam from the surface of the earth, that is, its face, by taking a handful of it of all its colors and kneading it with different waters and smoothing it and breathing the spirit into it, so it became a sensitive animal after it was Inanimate

“And He taught Adam the names” meaning the names of the things named “all of them” by casting their knowledge into his heart “Then He presented them” meaning the things named, and in this is the predominance of rational beings “to the angels and said” to them as a rebuke “Inform Me” inform Me “of the names of these” the things named “if you are truthful” in that I am not created, I know better than you or that you are more deserving of the caliphate. The answer to the condition is indicated by what preceded it

“They said, ‘Glory be to You’” purifying You from objecting to You “We have no knowledge except what You have taught us” it “Indeed, You are” emphasizing the kaf “The Knowing, the Wise” from whose knowledge and wisdom nothing is outside of

“He” the Most High “said, ‘O Adam, inform them’ meaning the angels “of their names” the things named, so He named each thing by its name and mentioned the wisdom for which He created it “So when he informed them of their names, He said” the Most High to them as a rebuke “Did I not tell you that I know the unseen of the heavens and the earth” what is hidden in them “And I know what you reveal” what you reveal of your saying, “Will You place therein the unseen?” ""And what you were concealing"" you were concealing from your saying that God will not create anyone more honorable to Him than us, and I do not know."
j-0014	"“And” remember “when We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate to Adam,’ a prostration of greeting by bowing, “and they prostrated, except for Iblis,” he is the father of the jinn, he was among the angels. “He refused,” he refused to prostrate, “and was arrogant,” he was arrogant toward him and said, “I am better than him,” “and he was of the disbelievers,” in the knowledge of God. “And We said, ‘O Adam, dwell, you and your wife,’ Eve with the long vowel, and He created her from his left rib, “in Paradise and eat from it, abundantly, spaciously, without any stones, wherever you wish. But do not approach this tree,’ by eating from it, which is wheat or grapes or other than them, “lest you be among the wrongdoers,” the disobedient. “But Satan caused them to slip,” Iblis made them slip, he made them slip, and in another reading, “fazalahuhuma,” he removed them “from it,” meaning Paradise, by saying to them, ‘Shall I guide you to the tree of eternity?’ and he swore to them by God that he was for them among the sincere advisors.’ So they ate from it. “So he removed them from what they were in,” of bliss, “and We said, ‘And We said, “Go down” to the earth, that is, you and what you have of your offspring “some of you” some of your offspring “are enemies to one another” from the oppression of one another “and for you on the earth is a settlement” a place of settlement “and provision” what you enjoy of its plants “for a time” the time of the expiration of your terms

“Then Adam received from his Lord words” He inspired them to him. In a reading with Adam in the accusative and the nominative words, that is, He came to him and they are: Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves” the verse, so he called upon them “and He turned to him” before his repentance “for He is the Accepter of Repentance” to His servants “the Most Merciful” to them

“We said, ‘Go down from it’ from Paradise “all of you” He repeated it to connect it to it “and if” in it there is an assimilation of the conditional “nun” in the redundant “there comes to you from Me guidance” a Book and a Messenger “then whoever follows My guidance” believes in Me and acts in obedience to Me “there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve” in the Hereafter that they will enter Paradise

“And those who disbelieve and deny Our signs” Our Book “those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally” remaining They never die or go out."
j-0015	"“O Children of Israel,” the children of Jacob, “remember My favor which I bestowed upon you,” that is, upon your fathers, such as salvation from Pharaoh, the splitting of the sea, the shading of the clouds, and other things, by thanking Me for it by obeying Me. “And fulfill My covenant,” which I enjoined upon you of belief in Muhammad. “I will fulfill your covenant,” which I enjoined upon you of reward by entering Paradise. “And fear Me,” fear in not fulfilling it, rather than anyone else. “And believe in what I have revealed,” of the Qur’an, “confirming that which is with you,” of the Torah, in agreement with it in monotheism and prophethood. “And do not be the first to disbelieve in it,” of the People of the Book, because your descendants will follow you, so their sin is upon you. “And do not exchange,” exchange, “My revelations,” which are in your book, describing Muhammad, “for a small price,” a small exchange from this world, that is, do not conceal them for fear of missing out on what you will take from your lowest ones. “And fear Me,” fear in that, rather than anyone else. “And do not confuse,” mix, “the truth,” which I have revealed. ""Upon you ""with falsehood"" which you fabricate ""and"" do not ""conceal the truth"" the description of Muhammad ""while you know"" that it is the truth

""And establish prayer and give zakat and bow with those who bow"" pray with the praying Muhammad and his companions and it was revealed about their scholars and they used to say to their Muslim relatives, ""Stand firm in the religion of Muhammad for it is the truth""

""Do you enjoin righteousness upon the people"" by believing in Muhammad ""and forget yourselves"" you abandon them and do not enjoin it ""while you recite the Scripture"" the Torah and in it is the threat for contradicting words with deeds ""Do you not understand"" your bad deeds so you return so the sentence of forgetfulness is the subject of the rhetorical question

""And seek help"" seek help in your affairs ""through patience"" restraining the self from what it dislikes ""and prayer"" he mentioned it alone to magnify its importance and in the hadith when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was concerned with something he would hasten to pray and it was said that the address was to the Jews when greed and the love of leadership prevented them from believing so they were enjoined with patience, which is fasting because it suppresses desire and prayer because it causes inheritance Humility and negation of arrogance. “And indeed” that is, prayer “is difficult” heavy “except for the humbly submissive” who are at peace with obedience. “Who think” are certain “that they will meet their Lord” in resurrection “and that they will return to Him” in the Hereafter, so He will reward them. “O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you” by thanking Me for it through obedience “and that I preferred you” that is, your fathers “over the worlds” the worlds of their time. “And fear” fear “a Day when” “no soul will suffice for another soul at all” that is, the Day of Resurrection “nor will intercession be accepted” with the letter ta’ and the letter ya’ “from it” that is, it has no intercession so it will be accepted, so we have no intercessors “nor will compensation be taken from it” as ransom “nor will they be aided” they will be prevented from the punishment of God."
j-0016	"“And” remember “when We delivered you” that is, your fathers, and the address with it and what follows it is to those who were present at the time of our Prophet, with what God bestowed upon their fathers, reminding them of the grace of God Almighty so that they would believe “from the people of Pharaoh, who subjected you” made you taste “the worst of torment” the most severe, and the sentence is a state of the pronoun “We delivered you” “slaughtering” an explanation of what came before it “your sons” those who were born “and sparing” they kept “your women” because of what some of the priests said to him that a child born among the Children of Israel would be a cause for the loss of your kingdom “and in that” the torment or the rescue “is a great trial” a trial or a blessing “from your Lord”

“And” remember “when We parted” so We threw “for you” because of you “the sea” until you entered it fleeing from your enemy “and We delivered you” from drowning “and drowned the people of Pharaoh” his people with him “while you were looking on” at the sea closing in on them

“And when We made an appointment” with an alif and below it “with Moses” Forty nights” We give him the Torah at the end of which you may learn by it “then you took the calf” which the Samaritan fashioned for you as a god “after him” that is, after he had gone to our appointment “and you were wrongdoers” by taking him because you placed worship in the wrong place “then We pardoned you” We erased your sins “after that” the taking “so that you might be grateful” for Our favor upon you"
j-0017	"“And when We gave Moses the Scripture” the Torah “and the Criterion” an explanatory conjunction, meaning the difference between truth and falsehood, lawful and unlawful “that you may be guided” by it from misguidance.

“And when Moses said to his people” those who worshipped the calf “O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf” as a god “so repent to your Creator” your Creator from worshipping it “and kill yourselves” that is, so that the innocent among you may kill the criminal “that” killing “is better for you in the sight of your Creator” so He guided you to do that and sent a black cloud upon you so that some of you would not see others and have mercy on them until he killed about seventy thousand of you “and He turned to you” before your repentance “for He is the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful.”

“And when you said” and you went out with Moses to apologize to God for worshipping the calf and you heard his words “O Moses, we will not believe you until we see God plainly” with your own eyes “so the thunderbolt” the shout took you “and you died while you were looking” what happened How much

“Then We raised you up” We revived you “after your death that you might be grateful” for Our blessing with that

“And We shaded you with the clouds” We covered you with thin clouds from the heat of the sun in the wilderness “And We sent down upon you” in it “manna and quails” they are the tarangbin and the quail with a lightened and shortened meem and We said “Eat from the good things with which We have provided you” and do not hoard, so they denied the blessing and hoarded, so it was cut off from them “And they did not wrong Us” with that “but they were wronging themselves” because its consequences were upon them"
j-0018	“And when We said” to them after they had left the wilderness “Enter this city” Jerusalem or Jericho “and eat from it wherever you wish in abundance” spacious and without stones “and enter the gate” that is, its gate “prostrating” bowing down “and say” our question “forgiveness” that is, forgive us our sins “We will forgive” and in a reading with the ya and the ta’ in the passive form “for you your sins and We will increase the reward of the doers of good” through obedience. “But those who did wrong” among them “substituted a statement other than that which was said to them” so they said “a grain in a hair” and entered crawling on their buttocks “so We sent down upon those who did wrong” in this the apparent is placed in place of the implicit as an exaggeration of the ugliness of their condition “a punishment” a plague “from the sky because they were defiantly disobedient” because of their defamation, that is, their departure from obedience, so seventy thousand of them perished in an hour or less.
j-0019	"“And” remember “when Moses sought water” that is, asked for water “for his people” and they were thirsty in the wilderness “so We said, ‘Strike the rock with your staff’” and that is the one who fled with his light, square garment like a man’s head, made of marble or something like that, so he struck it “and there gushed forth” split and flowed “from it twelve springs” according to the number of the tribes “every people knew” a tribe of them “their drinking place” the place where they would drink, so no one else would share it with them. And We said to them, “Eat and drink from the provision of Allah and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption” a state of emphasis for its agent from ‘atha with a kasra on the triangle, afsad
“And when you said, ‘O Moses, we will not be patient with one food’” that is, a type of it “so call upon your Lord to produce for us” something “of what the earth grows” for clarification “of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic” its wheat “and its lentils and its onions” Moses said to them, “Will you exchange that which is lower” more despicable “for that which is better” more noble, that is, would you take it? And they refused to return, so he called upon God Almighty, and God Almighty said, “Go down,” descend, “to Egypt,” from the cities, “for you will have,” in it, “what you asked,” of plants, “and humiliation and destitution have been struck upon them,” humiliation and disgrace, “and poverty,” meaning the effect of poverty from stillness and shame, so it is binding upon them even if they were rich, as is the case with a minted dirham for its minting, “and they incurred,” they returned, “in wrath from God. That,” meaning the striking and wrath, “because they,” meaning because they “disbelieved in the signs of God and killed the prophets,” such as Zechariah and John, “unjustly,” meaning unjustly, “that is because they disobeyed and were transgressors,” exceeding the limit in sins, and he repeated it for emphasis. “Indeed, those who believed,” in the prophets before, “and those who were Jews,” they are the Jews, “and the Christians and the Sabians,” a group of Jews or Christians, “whoever believed,” of them, “in God and the Last Day,” in the time of our Prophet, “and did righteousness,” according to His law. “They will have their reward” meaning the reward for their deeds “with their Lord. There will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve.” The pronoun “aman” and the verb “min” and what follows it have the same meaning."
j-0020	“And” remember “when We took your covenant” your covenant to act according to what is in the Torah “and” We “raised the Mount above you” the mountain, uprooting it from its base over you when you refused to accept it, and We said, “Take what We have given you with strength” with diligence and effort “and remember what is in it” by acting according to it “that you may guard against” the Fire or sins. “Then you turned away” you turned away “after that” the covenant from obedience “so were it not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy” to you through repentance or delaying the punishment “you would have been among the losers” the perishing. “And you” the oath “you knew” you recognized “those among you who transgressed” exceeded the limit “on the Sabbath” by fishing, and We forbade them from it, and they were the people of Aylah “so We said to them, “Be apes, despised” banished, so they were and perished after three days. “So We made it” that is, that punishment “an example” a deterrent from committing the same as they did “for those before it and those after it” that is, for the nations at its time and after it. “And an admonition for those who fear God.” They were specifically mentioned because they are the ones who benefit, unlike others.
j-0021	And remember when Moses said to his people, when they had been killed and they did not know who killed him, and they asked him to call upon God to make it clear to them, so he called upon Him, “God commands you to slaughter a cow.” They said, “Do you take us in mockery?” mocking us by answering us with such a thing. “He said, “I seek refuge in God from being among the ignorant,” the mockers. Then when they knew that he had decided, “they said, ‘Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is,’” that is, what its age is. “He said, ‘God says that it is a cow neither old nor virgin, young, but halfway between that, so do what you are commanded, of slaughtering it.’ They said, “Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what its color is.” He said, “He says that it is a yellow cow, bright in color,” intense yellow, “pleasing to the observers,” at it with its beauty, that is, pleasing them. “They said, ‘Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is, that is, whether it is a young cow or a young cow.’” That is, its type The one described by what was mentioned “was similar to us” because of its abundance, so we were not guided to the intended meaning “and indeed, if Allah wills, we will be guided” to it. In the hadith, if they had not made an exception, it would not have been made clear to them until the end of time. “He said, ‘He says that she is a cow that is not submissive’” not tamed by work “that plows the earth” turning it over for cultivation. The sentence is a description of submissive included in the prohibition “and does not irrigate the tilth” the land prepared for cultivation “untouched” from defects and traces of work “without a blemish” color “in her” other than her color. “They said, ‘Now you have brought the truth’” she spoke with complete clarity, so they sought her and found her with the young man who was dutiful to his mother, so they bought her with a full musk of gold “so they slaughtered her, but they were not about to do so” because of the high price of her. In the hadith, if they had slaughtered any cow, it would have sufficed them, but they were hard on themselves, so Allah was hard on them. “And when you kill a person and then dispute” in it is the assimilation of the ta’ in the original into the dal, meaning you quarreled and pushed each other “therein is a way out for her, and Allah is the one who reveals “what you were concealing” of her matter. This is an objection and it is the beginning of the story. “So We said, ‘Strike him’ meaning the murdered man ‘with some of it’ so he struck her tongue or her tailbone and she came back to life and said, ‘So-and-so and so-and-so killed me’ to his cousins ​​and he died so they were forbidden from inheriting and killed. God Almighty said, ‘Thus’ the revival ‘God brings the dead to life and shows you His signs’ evidence of His power ‘that you may understand’ ponder and know that He who is able to revive one soul is able to revive many souls and you will believe.
j-0022	“Then your hearts hardened,” O Jews, they were stubborn in accepting the truth, “after that,” mentioned in the revival of the slain man and the verses that preceded it, “so they are like stones,” in hardness, “or even harder,” than them. “And indeed, among the stones are those from which rivers burst forth, and indeed, among them are those which split open,” in which the ta’ in the original is assimilated into the shin, “and water issues from them, and indeed, among them are those which descend,” descend from high to low, “for fear of Allah,” and your hearts are not affected, nor soften, nor humble. “And Allah is not unaware of what you do,” but He only delays you for your time. In another reading, it is with the ta’taniyya, and in it there is a shift from the address. “Do you then,” O believers, “believe that they will believe in you,” that is, the Jews, “while there was a party,” a group, “of them,” in the Torah, “and then they distorted it,” changed it, “after they had understood it,” understood it, “while they knew,” that they were slanderers. The hamza is for denial, meaning do not be greedy, for they have a history of disbelief.
j-0023	“And when they meet” that is, the hypocrites, the Jews “who believe, they say, ‘We believe’” that Muhammad is a prophet and he is the one given glad tidings in our Book. “But when they are alone” they return “to one another” they say, that is, their leaders who were not hypocrites, to the one who was hypocritical. “Do you speak to them” that is, the believers “of what Allah has revealed to you” that is, what He has made known to you in the Torah of the description of Muhammad “so that they may dispute with you about it before your Lord” in the Hereafter and establish against you the argument for abandoning following him despite your knowledge of his truthfulness. “Do you not understand?” that they will dispute with you if you speak to them, so that you will desist. God Almighty says, “Or do they not know” the question is for confirmation and the waw that comes before it is for conjunction “that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare” what they conceal and what they reveal of that and other things, so they are wary of that.
j-0024	“And among them” meaning the Jews “are ignorant” common people “who do not know the Scripture” the Torah “except” but “wishes” lies they received from their leaders and adopted them “and they” in denying the prophethood of the Prophet and other things they invent “only assume” assumptions and have no knowledge. “So woe” severe punishment “to those who write the Scripture with their own hands” meaning inventing it from themselves “and then say, ‘This is from God’ in order to exchange it for a small price” from this world, and they are the Jews who changed the description of the Prophet in the Torah and the verse of stoning and others and wrote it contrary to what was revealed. “So woe to them for what their hands have written” from inventing “and woe to them for what they earn” from bribery, the plural of bribe.
j-0025	"""And they said,"" when the Prophet promised them the Fire, ""The Fire will not touch us except for a few days,"" forty days, the period of their fathers' worship of the calf, then it will go away. ""Say,"" to them, O Muhammad, ""Have you taken,"" the hamzat al-wasl was removed from it, dispensing with the hamzat al-istifham, ""with Allah a covenant,"" a pact from Him to that effect, ""so Allah will never break His covenant,"" with it, ""or do you say about Allah what you do not know?"" ""Yes,"" it will touch you and you will remain in it forever. ""Whoever earns evil,"" polytheism, ""and his sin encompasses him,"" in the singular and plural, meaning it has taken hold of him and surrounded him from every side, because he died a polytheist, ""they are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally,"" the meaning of ""from"" was taken into account in it. ""And those who believe and do righteous deeds, those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally."""
j-0026	“And” remember “when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel” in the Torah and said “You shall not worship” with the ta’ and the ya’ “except Allah” news with the meaning of prohibition. It was read “Do not worship” “and” be good “to parents” with kindness “and to relatives” kinship is in apposition to parents “and orphans and the needy and speak to people” with “good” words, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong and being truthful about Muhammad and being kind to them. In a reading with the damma on the ha’ and the sukoon on the seen, it is a source of description with exaggeration “and establish prayer and give zakah” so you accepted that “then you turned away” you turned away from fulfilling it in this is a shift from absence and what is meant is their fathers “except a few of you, and you turned away” from it like your fathers. “And when We took your covenant” and said “You shall not shed your blood” you shall shed it by killing one another “nor expel yourselves from your homes” you shall not expel one another from his home “then you acknowledged” you accepted that covenant “and you are “You bear witness” against yourselves “Then you” O “these ones kill yourselves” by killing each other “and you expel a party of you from their homes, supporting one another” in this is the assimilation of the ta’ in the original into the dhad and in a reading with a lightening with its deletion you cooperate “against them in sin” in disobedience “and aggression” injustice “and if they come to you as captives” in a reading captives “you ransom them” in a reading “you ransom them” you rescue them from captivity with money or something else which is what was entrusted to them “and it” that is the matter “is forbidden to you to expel them” connected to his saying and you expel and the sentence between them is an interruption, that is just as it was forbidden to leave the ransom and the Qurayzah allied with the Aws and the Nadir and the Khazraj so each party would fight with its allies and destroy their homes and expel them and if they were taken captive they ransomed them and when they were asked why did you fight them and ransom them they would say we were commanded to ransom them and it would be said then why did you fight them and they would say shyness lest our allies be humiliated God Almighty said “Do you believe in part of the Scripture” and that is ransom “And you disbelieve in some” meaning leaving the killing, expulsion and demonstration “so what is the reward of those who do that among you except disgrace” humiliation and degradation “in the life of this world” and they were disgraced by the killing of Qurayzah and the exile of Nadir to Syria and the imposition of the jizya “and on the Day of Resurrection they will be returned to the severest of punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what they do” with the letter ya and the letter ta “those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter” by preferring it over it “so the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided” they will be prevented from it
j-0027	“And We gave Moses the Scripture” the Torah “and followed him up with messengers” that is, We followed them one messenger after another “and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs” miracles such as raising the dead and healing the blind and the leper “and supported him” We strengthened him “with the Holy Spirit” from adding the described to the description, that is, the Holy Spirit Gabriel, because of his purity, walks with him wherever he walks, so you did not go straight. “So whenever a messenger came to you with what your souls did not desire” you loved “of the truth” you were arrogant” you were arrogant about following him, the answer to “whenever” and it is the subject of the question and what is meant by it is rebuke “so a party” of them “you denied” like Jesus “and a party you killed” the present tense for the narration of the past situation, that is, you killed like Zachariah and John “and they said” to the Prophet in mockery “our hearts are covered” the plural of “covered” meaning covered with covers so you do not understand what you are saying. God Almighty said “rather” for emphasis “God has cursed them” He distanced them from His mercy and let them down from accepting “because of their disbelief” and not lack of Their acceptance of a defect in their hearts, “so little do they believe.” “Ma” is redundant to emphasize the little, meaning their faith is very little.
j-0028	“And when there came to them a Book from God confirming what was with them” of the Torah, which is the Qur’an, “and before” before its coming, “they used to pray for victory” seeking aid “against those who disbelieved” saying, “O God, grant us victory over them through the Prophet sent at the end of time.” “But when there came to them that which they recognized” of the truth, which is the mission of the Prophet, “they disbelieved in it” out of denial and fear for leadership, and the answer to the first “what” is indicated by the answer to the second “so the curse of God is upon the disbelievers.” “Evil is that for which they sold” they sold “their souls” that is, their share of the reward. “What” is indefinite, meaning something, distinguishing the agent of “Evil” and the one specifically condemned “that they should disbelieve” that is, their disbelief “in what God has revealed” of the Qur’an “out of envy” the object of “to disbelieve” that is, out of envy “that God should send down” with a light and heavy “of His grace” the revelation “on whomever He wills” for the message “of His servants. So they incurred” they returned “with wrath” from God for their disbelief in what He revealed, and the indefiniteness is for emphasis “for wrath” which they had deserved before by neglecting the Torah. And disbelief in Jesus “and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment”
j-0029	“And when it is said to them, ‘Believe in what Allah has revealed,’ they say, ‘We believe in what was revealed to us,’ meaning the Torah. Allah the Most High said, ‘And they disbelieve,’ the waw is for the state, ‘in what is beyond it,’ other than it or after it of the Qur’an, ‘while it is the truth,’ a state, ‘confirming,’ a second state, ‘what is with them. Say,’ to them, ‘Then why did you kill,’ meaning did you kill, ‘the prophets of Allah before, if you were believers,’ in the Torah, and you were forbidden in it from killing them, and the address is to those who were present at the time of our Prophet, because of what their fathers did because they were pleased with it. ‘And indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs,’ with miracles such as the staff and the hand and the splitting of the sea, ‘then you took the calf,’ as a god, ‘after him,’ after he had gone to the appointed time, ‘while you were wrongdoers,’ in taking it. ‘And when We took your covenant,’ to act according to what is in the Torah, ‘and,’ ‘We raised above you the mountain,’ the mountain when you refused to accept it so that it would fall upon you, and We said, ‘Take what We have given you with strength,’ with seriousness and effort. “And listen” to what you are commanded to do with an accepting hearing. “They said, ‘We hear’ your statement, ‘and we disobey’ your command. And they made the calf drink into their hearts’, that is, their love for it mingled with their hearts as a drink is mingled with it, ‘because of their disbelief. Say’ to them, ‘How evil’ is that which your faith enjoins upon you, in the Torah, the worship of the calf, ‘if you are believers’ in it as you claim. The meaning is that you are not believers, because faith does not command the worship of the calf, and what is meant is their fathers. So likewise you are not believers in the Torah, and you have denied Muhammad, and belief in it does not command the denial of him.
j-0030	«Say» to them «If the home of the Hereafter is yours» that is, Paradise «with Allah alone» specifically «and not the people» as you claimed «then wish for death if you should be truthful» the two conditions are attached to wishing for, the first being a restriction in the second, that is, if you are truthful in your claim that it is yours and whoever has it prefers it and the way to it is death, then wish for it. «And they will never wish for it because of what their hands have put forth» of their disbelief in the Prophet, which entails their lying «and Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers» the disbelievers, so He will punish them «and you will find them» the lam of an oath «the most greedy of people for life and» greedier «than those who associate others with Allah» those who deny the resurrection for it because they know that their destiny is the Fire, not the polytheists because of their denial of it «one of them would wish» wishes «that he could live a thousand years» law is a source meaning that and it is in its connection in the interpretation of the source of the object of wish «and it» that is, one of them «will not remove him» distance him «from the punishment» the Fire «that he should live a long life» the subject of the word «moved» that is, his life «and Allah is Seeing of what They work with the letter “ya” and the letter “ta” and He rewards them. Ibn Suriya asked the Prophet or Omar about who among the angels brings revelation, so he said Gabriel. He said, “He is our enemy who brings punishment.” If it were Michael, we would have believed because he brings fertility and peace. So he descended.
j-0031	“Say” to them, “Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel” let him die of rage “for indeed he has brought it down” that is, the Qur’an “upon your heart by permission” by command “of Allah, confirming what was before it” his heart of the books “and guidance” from misguidance “and good tidings” of Paradise “for the believers” “Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel” with a kasra or fatha on the jim without a hamza and with a ya’ or without it “and Mika’il” in apposition to the angels from the apposition of the specific to the general and in the reading of Mika’il with a hamza and a ya’ and in another without a ya’ “then indeed Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers” and He made it a position for them as a statement of their condition
j-0032	“And We have certainly sent down to you,” O Muhammad, “clear signs,” that is, clear signs in response to Ibn Suriya’s statement to the Prophet, “You have not brought us anything,” “and none disbelieve in them except the wicked,” they disbelieved in them. “Or whenever they made a covenant,” with God, “to believe in the Prophet if he went out, or the Prophet not to help the polytheists against him, “a party of them cast it aside,” by breaking it, the answer to “everything,” which is the subject of the rhetorical question. “Rather,” due to the transition, “most of them do not believe.” “And when there came to them a Messenger from God,” Muhammad, “confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Scripture threw the Book of God behind their backs,” that is, the Torah, “as if they did not know,” what was in it, that he was a true Prophet or that it was the Book of God.
j-0033	“And they followed” is an appositive to “rejection” “what the devils recited” that is, recited “during” the reign of “Solomon” of magic, and they buried it under his throne when his kingdom was taken away, or they were eavesdropping and adding lies to it and sending it to the priests to write it down, and this spread and it became known that the jinn knew the unseen, so Solomon gathered the books and buried them, and when he died, the devils guided the people to them, so they extracted them and found magic in them, and they said, “Your kingship is only for this, so learn it,” so they rejected the books of their prophets. God Almighty said, exonerating Solomon and responding to the Jews in their saying, “Look at Muhammad, he mentions Solomon among the prophets, and he was nothing but a magician.” “And Solomon did not disbelieve,” that is, he did not practice magic because he disbelieved. “But” with emphasis and with emphasis, “the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic,” the sentence is a state of the pronoun of disbelieved. “And” they teach them “what was revealed to the two angels,” that is, inspired him of magic, and it was read with a kasra on the lam, who were in “Babylon,” a country in the blackness of Iraq, “Harut and Marut” is a substitute or appositive of the two angels. Ibn Abbas said, they are: Two magicians were teaching magic, and it was said that they were two angels who were sent down to teach it as a trial from God to the people. “And they do not teach anyone” an extra “until they say” to him as advice “We are only a trial” a trial from God to the people to test them by teaching it. Whoever learns it is a disbeliever and whoever abandons it is a believer “so do not disbelieve” by learning it, for if they refuse except to teach it, they taught it “and they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife” by making each one hate the other “and they” that is, the magicians “can harm thereby” with magic “anyone” an extra “except by permission of God” by His will “and they learn that which harms them” in the Hereafter “and does not benefit them” which is magic “and they have certainly” an oath “taught” that is, the Jews “to whoever” an initial “lam” attached to what precedes it and “from” connecting “whom” “has no share in the Hereafter” a share in Paradise “and evil is that” something “for which they have exchanged” they sold “their souls” that is, the buyers, that is, their share in the Hereafter if they learn it where He has made Hell obligatory for them, “if they only knew,” the truth of what they would end up in of torment, what they learned. “And if they” that is, the Jews “had believed” in the Prophet and the Qur’an “and feared” God’s punishment by abandoning His sins, such as magic. The answer to “if” is omitted, meaning they would have been rewarded. “A reward” is indicated by “reward” which is the subject, and the lam in it is for swearing, “from God is better” its predicate than what they sold themselves for. “If they only knew” that it was better, they would not have preferred it over it.
j-0034	“O you who have believed, do not say” to the Prophet “Ra’ina” a command from “al-mara’a” and they used to say that to him, and in the language of the Jews it is an insult from “al-ra’una” so they interpreted it and addressed the Prophet with it, so the believers were forbidden from it. “And say” instead of it “unzurna” meaning look at us “and listen” to what you are commanded to hear with acceptance. “And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment” painful, which is the Fire. “Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists” from the Arabs are in apposition to the People of the Scripture, and “min” is for clarification “that any” redundant “good” revelation “from your Lord” out of envy of you “And God singles out for His mercy” His prophethood “whoever He wills, and God is the possessor of great bounty.”
j-0035	When the infidels challenged the abrogation and said that Muhammad commands his companions to do something today and forbids them tomorrow, the conditional “what” was revealed. “We abrogate from a verse” meaning we send down its ruling either with its wording or not. In a reading with a dammah on the “nun” from “anṣḥ” meaning we order you or Gabriel to abrogate it “or we make you forget it” we delay it so we do not send down its ruling and we remove its recitation or we delay it in the Preserved Tablet. In a reading without a hamza from “al-nisyan” meaning we make it forget it, meaning we erase it from your heart. The answer to the conditional “We bring something better than it” more beneficial for the servants in ease or great reward “or like it” in assignment and recompense. “Do you not know that Allah has dominion over all things?” From this comes abrogation, substitution, and questioning for confirmation. “Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth” He does what He wills “and that you have not besides Allah” meaning other than Him “any” redundant “protector” to protect you “or helper” to prevent His punishment from you if He comes to you. And it was revealed when the people of Mecca asked Him to expand it and turn al-Safa into gold. “Am” Rather, “you want to ask your Messenger as Moses was asked before,” that is, his people asked him “before,” by saying, “Show us God openly,” and other things. “And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief,” that is, takes its place by abandoning consideration of the clear signs and suggesting others, “has certainly strayed from the right path,” he has strayed from the right path, and the right path is basically the middle way.
j-0036	“Many of the People of the Scripture wish that they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from their own selves, after the truth has become clear to them in the Torah. So pardon them and overlook them until Allah brings about His command, concerning them, in terms of fighting. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.” “And establish prayer and give zakah. And whatever good you put forward for yourselves, obedience such as kinship and charity, you will find it, that is, its reward, with Allah. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of what you do.” So He will reward you for it.
j-0037	“And they say, ‘None will enter Paradise except he who is a Jew or a Christian.’” The Jews of Medina and the Christians of Najran said this when they debated before the Prophet, meaning the Jews said, “None will enter it except the Jews,” and the Christians said, “None will enter it except the Christians.” “That,” this statement, “is their wishful thinking,” their vain desires. “Say,” to them, “Bring your proof,” your argument for that, “if you should be truthful,” in it. “Yes,” others will enter Paradise. “Whoever submits his face to God,” meaning submits to His command, and He singled out the face because it is the most honorable of the limbs, so others are more deserving, “and is a doer of good,” a monotheist, “will have his reward with his Lord,” meaning the reward for his work is Paradise. “And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve,” in the Hereafter.
j-0038	“And the Jews say, ‘The Christians are not upon anything,’” is a valid argument and they disbelieved in Jesus. “And the Christians say, ‘The Jews are not upon anything,’” is a valid argument and they disbelieved in Moses. “And they” that is, the two groups “recite the Scripture” revealed to them. In the book of the Jews is the belief in Jesus, and in the book of the Christians is the belief in Moses. The sentence is a condition. “Thus” as these people said. “Those who do not know” that is, the polytheists among the Arabs and others “said the same as their saying,” explaining the meaning of that, that is, they said to every person of religion that they are not upon anything. “So God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ,” concerning the matter of religion. So the one who is right will enter Paradise and the one who is wrong will enter Hell.
j-0039	"""And who is more unjust"" meaning no one is more unjust ""than he who prevents the mosques of Allah from being remembered therein"" through prayer and glorification ""and strives toward their ruin"" through demolition or disabling it. It was revealed as a report about the Romans who destroyed the Holy House or about the polytheists when they prevented the Prophet in the year of Hudaybiyyah from entering the House. ""It is not for them to enter it except in fear"" a report with the meaning of a command, meaning frighten them with jihad so that no one enters it safely. ""For them in this world is disgrace"" humiliation through killing, captivity and jizya ""and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment"" which is the Fire. It was revealed when the Jews challenged the abrogation of the qiblah or the voluntary prayer on the mount during travel, no matter what direction it is facing. ""And to Allah belong the east and the west"" meaning the entire earth because they are its direction. ""So wherever you turn"" your faces in prayer by His command ""there"" there ""is the face of Allah"" His qiblah which He is pleased with. ""Indeed, Allah is All-Encompassing"" His grace encompasses all things ""Knowing"" of the management of His creation."
j-0040	"""And they say"" with and without the waw, the Jews and Christians and those who claim that the angels are daughters of God ""God has taken a son"" God Almighty said ""Glory be to Him"", absolving Him from that ""Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth"", ownership, creation and servants, and ownership contradicts birth, and he used ""ma"" to emphasize what is not rational ""All are obedient to Him"", each obedient to what is wanted from him, and in it is the emphasis on rational things ""Originator of the heavens and the earth"", their Creator, not according to the example that preceded ""And when He decrees"", intends ""a matter"", that is, its creation ""He only says to it, ""Be,"" and it is"", that is, it is, and in a reading it is in the accusative case as an answer to the command ""And those who do not know say"", that is, the disbelievers of Mecca to the Prophet ""Why"", why does ""God not speak to us"", that you are His Messenger ""or a sign come to us"", from what we suggested to confirm your truthfulness ""Thus"", as these said ""those before them"", from the disbelievers of the past nations, said to their prophets ""The like of their saying"", of obstinacy and seeking signs ""Their hearts are alike"" in disbelief and obstinacy, in it is consolation for the Prophet “We have made clear the verses for a people who are certain” who know that they are verses and believe, so suggesting a verse with them is an exaggeration. “Indeed, We have sent you” O Muhammad “with the truth” with guidance “as a bearer of good tidings” for whoever responds to it of Paradise “and a warner” for whoever does not respond to it of Hellfire “and do not ask about the companions of Hellfire” Hellfire, meaning the disbelievers, what is wrong with them that they did not believe? You are only responsible for conveying the message. In a reading with a sukoon, you ask as a prohibition."
j-0041	“And never will the Jews or the Christians be pleased with you until you follow their religion.” Their religion. “Say, ‘Indeed, the guidance of Allah,’ meaning Islam, “that is the guidance.” And anything other than it is misguidance. “And if” the oath lam, “you follow their desires,” to which they call you as an obligation, “after what has come to you of knowledge,” the revelation from Allah, “you will have from Allah no protector,” to protect you, “nor helper,” to prevent you from Him. “Those to whom We have given the Scripture,” is the subject, “recite it with its true recitation,” meaning they read it as it was revealed. The clause is a state, and “haqq” is an accusative of the source and the predicate. “Those believe in it,” it was revealed about a group who came from Abyssinia and became Muslims. “And whoever disbelieves in it,” meaning the Scripture that was given to them by distorting it, “then it is they who are the losers,” because they will be destined for eternal Hellfire.
j-0042	“O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds.” A similar example has come before. “And fear a Day when no soul will avail another soul at all, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will intercession benefit it, nor will they be aided.”
j-0043	"“And” remember “when his Lord tried” tested “Abraham” and in the reading of Abraham “with words” with commands and prohibitions that He charged him with. It was said that they were the rituals of Hajj, and it was said that they were rinsing the mouth, inhaling water from the nose, using the siwak, trimming the moustache, parting the hair, cutting the nails, plucking the armpits, shaving the pubic hair, circumcision, and using the toilet “and complete them” he performed them completely. “He said” the Most High to him “Indeed, I will make you an imam for the people” a model in religion. “He said: And of my descendants” my children, will I make imams? “He said: My covenant” of the imamate “will not include the wrongdoers” the disbelievers among them. This indicates that it includes other than the wrongdoer. “And when We made the House” the Kaaba “a resort for the people” a reference to which they would rush from every side “and a security” a security for them from injustice and raids occurring elsewhere. A man would meet his father’s killer in it and not provoke him. “And take” O people “from the standing place of Abraham” it is the stone on which he stood when building the House “a place of prayer” by praying behind it. The two rak'ahs of tawaf, and in a reading with the opening of the kha', the news of ""And We charged Abraham and Ishmael"" We commanded them ""to"" that is, to ""purify My House"" from idols ""for those who perform Tawaf and those who stay there"" ""and bow and prostrate"" the plural of bowing and prostrating are the worshippers. ""And when Abraham said, 'My Lord, make this' the place ""a secure city"" one of security, and God answered his prayer and made it a sanctuary in which no human blood would be shed, no one would be wronged therein, no game would be hunted and no one would be alone ""and provide its people with fruits"" He did so by moving Ta'if from Ash-Sham to it, and it was barren with no crops or water ""whoever of them believes in God and the Last Day"" instead of his people and He singled them out for supplication for them in agreement with His saying, ""My covenant does not include the wrongdoers."" He said, the Most High, ""And"" provide ""for whoever disbelieves - I will give him enjoyment"" with emphasis and with emphasis in this world with provision ""for a little"" for the duration of his life ""then I will force him"" I will force him in the Hereafter ""to the punishment of the Fire"" from which he will find no escape ""and an evil destination"" the reference is it. “And” remember “when Abraham was raising the foundations” the foundations or the walls “of the House” he was building it is related to “raises” “and Ishmael” in apposition to Abraham, they were saying “Our Lord, accept from us” our building “for You are the Hearing” of the saying “the Knowing” of the action

“Our Lord, and make us Muslims” submissive “to You and” make “from our descendants” our children “a nation” a group “submissive to You” “of” is for partiality and it was brought to precede his saying “My covenant does not include the wrongdoers” “and show us” teach us “our rites” the laws of our worship or our pilgrimage “and accept our repentance for You for You are the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful” they asked Him for repentance despite their infallibility out of humility and teaching their descendants

“Our Lord, and send among them” meaning the people of the House “a messenger from among themselves” from among themselves and God answered his prayer with Muhammad “who will recite to them Your verses” the Qur’an “and teach them the Book” the Qur’an “and wisdom” meaning what is in it of rulings “and purify them” purify them from polytheism “for You are the Exalted in Might” the Victorious “the Wise” in Made by"
j-0044	"“And whoever” that is, “wants away from the religion of Abraham” and abandons it “except he who makes a fool of himself” who is ignorant that it was created by God and must worship Him, or who belittles himself and despises it “and We have certainly chosen him” we have chosen him “in this world” with the message and friendship “and indeed, in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous” who will have the highest ranks.

And remember “when his Lord said to him, ‘Submit’” submit to God and make your religion sincere to Him “he said, ‘I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds’”

“And Abraham enjoined” in another reading, he enjoined “it” with the religion “to his sons and Jacob” his sons, he said, “O my sons, indeed God has chosen for you the religion” the religion of Islam “so do not die except as Muslims” he forbade abandoning Islam and commanded steadfastness in it until death came.”

And when the Jews said to the Prophet, “Do you not know that when Jacob died, he enjoined Judaism on his sons?” the following was revealed: “Or were you witnesses” present “when death approached Jacob when” instead of “when before it” “he said to his sons, ‘What will you worship after me’” after my death “they said We worship your God and the God of your fathers, Abraham, Ishmael, and Isaac” Ishmael’s grandfather from the fathers, the emphasis is on the fact that the uncle is in the position of the father “one God” instead of your God “and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him” and “umm” means the hamza of denial, meaning you were not present at the time of his death, so how can you attribute to him what is not befitting of him “that” is the subject and the reference is to Abraham and Jacob and between them and the feminine because of the feminine of its predicate “a nation that has passed on” has gone before “it shall have what it earned” of work, meaning its reward is a resumption “and for you” the address is to the Jews “what you earned, and you will not be asked about what they used to know” just as they will not be asked about your work, and the sentence confirms what came before it"
j-0045	"""And they said, 'Be Jews or Christians and you will be guided. '"" Or for preference, and the speaker of the first is the Jews of Medina and the second is the Christians of Najran. ""Say,"" to them, ""Rather, we will follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth,"" a state of Abraham, inclined from all religions to the true religion. ""And he was not of the polytheists."" ""Say,"" addressing the believers, ""We believe in God and in what was revealed to us,"" of the Qur'an, ""and what was revealed to Abraham,"" of the ten scrolls, ""and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes,"" his sons, ""and in what was given to Moses,"" of the Torah, ""and Jesus,"" of the Gospel, ""and in what was given to the prophets from their Lord,"" of the books and verses. ""We make no distinction between any of them,"" so we believe in some and disbelieve in others, like the Jews and Christians. ""And we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."" ""So if they believe,"" that is, the Jews and Christians, ""in the like,"" an extra ""of what you believe in, then they have been guided. But if they turn away,"" from believing in it, ""then they are only in dissension,"" disagreement with you, ""then God will suffice you against them,"" O Muhammad, their dissension, ""and He is the Hearing."" For their sayings, “the All-Knowing” of their conditions, and He sufficed them by killing Qurayza, expelling Nadir, and imposing the jizya on them. “The dye of God” is a confirmed source of “we believed” and its accusative is an implied verb, meaning God dyed us, and what is meant by it is His religion upon which He created people because its effect is apparent on its owner like dye in a garment. “And who” meaning no one “is better than God in dyeing” as a distinction. “And we are His worshippers” The Jews said to the Muslims, “We are the people of the first book, and our qibla is older, and the prophets were not from the Arabs. If Muhammad had been a prophet, he would have been from us.” So it was revealed."
j-0046	«Say» to them «Do you argue with us» do you quarrel with us «about Allah» that He chose a prophet from among the Arabs «and He is our Lord and your Lord» so He has the right to choose from among His servants whomever He wishes «and to Us are our deeds» we will reward them «and to You are your deeds» you will be rewarded for them so it is not far-fetched that there is in our deeds what we deserve honor «and we are sincere to Him» religion and work rather than you so we are more deserving of being chosen and the hamza is for denial and the three sentences are states «Or» rather «do you say» with the ta and the ya «that Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac and Jacob and the tribes were Jews or Christians? Say» to them «Are you more knowing or is Allah» that is, Allah is more knowing and Abraham disavowed them by saying, Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian and those mentioned with him followed him «and who is more unjust than he who conceals» conceals from the people «a testimony he has» that is «from Allah» that is, no one is more unjust than him and they are the Jews who concealed the testimony of Allah in the Torah about Abraham with the monotheism «and Allah is not unaware of what you do» a threat to them «That is a nation She will have what she earned, and you will have what you have earned, and you will not be asked about what they used to do.” A similar verse was presented.
j-0047	"""The fools among the people"" the Jews and the polytheists ""will say: What has turned them away from the qiblah which they used to face"" in prayer, which is Jerusalem, and the use of the letter ""sin"" to indicate facing is from informing about the unseen. ""Say: To God belongs the east and the west"" meaning all directions, so He orders facing in whichever direction He wishes, without objection. ""He guides whom He wills"" His guidance ""to a straight path"" the religion of Islam, meaning you are among them. He indicated this. ""And thus"" just as We have guided you to it, ""We have made you"" O nation of Muhammad ""a just community"" the best and just ""that you will be witnesses over the people"" on the Day of Resurrection that their messengers conveyed to them ""and the Messenger will be a witness over you"" that he conveyed to you. ""And We did not make"" We made ""the qiblah"" for you now the direction ""which you used to face"" at first, which is the Kaaba, and he used to pray towards it, but when he migrated, he was ordered to face Jerusalem in order to win over the Jews, so he prayed towards it for six or seventeen months, then he changed ""except that We might know"" the knowledge of the appearance ""who follows the Messenger."" And he believes him “from among those who turn back on their heels” that is, return to disbelief, doubting the religion and thinking that the Prophet is confused about his affair and that a group of people have apostatized because of that. “And indeed” is a lightened form of the heavy one and its subject is omitted, meaning that “it was” that is, turning to it “a great burden” difficult for the people “except for those whom Allah has guided” among them. “And Allah would not let your faith be lost” that is, your prayers toward the Holy House, rather He will reward you for it because the reason for its revelation was the question about those who died before the conversion. “Indeed, Allah is to the people” the believers “kind and merciful” in not wasting their deeds, and kindness is the intensity of mercy. The most eloquent was presented for the sake of the comma. “We have seen” the turning “of your face toward” the direction “of the heaven” looking forward to the revelation and eager for the command to face the Kaaba, and he wanted that because it was the qiblah of Abraham and because he called the Arabs to Islam. “So We will turn you” We will turn you “to a qiblah that pleases” that you love. “So turn your face” in prayer “toward” “the Sacred Mosque” that is, the Kaaba “and wherever you are” “You were” addressing the nation “turn your faces” in prayer “towards it. And indeed, those who were given the Scripture know that” that is, turning towards the Kaaba “is the truth” established “from their Lord” because of what is in their books of the description of the Prophet that he turns towards it “and Allah is not unaware of what you do” with the taa’, O believers, of obeying His command and with the yaa’, that is, the Jews, of denying the matter of the qiblah. “And if” with the lam of an oath “you brought to those who were given the Scripture every sign” of your truthfulness in the matter of the qiblah “they would not follow” that is, they would not follow “your qiblah” out of stubbornness “nor would you follow their qiblah” cutting off his hope for their conversion to Islam and their hope for his return to it “nor would some of them follow the qiblah of others” that is, the Jews the qiblah of the Christians and vice versa “and if you were to follow their desires” to which they invite you “after what has come to you of knowledge” revelation “then you would” if you follow them as an obligation “be among the wrongdoers”"
j-0048	“Those to whom We have given the Scripture know him” meaning Muhammad “as they know their own sons” by his description in their books. Ibn Salam said: I knew him when I saw him as I know my son, and my knowledge of Muhammad is stronger. “And indeed, a party of them conceal the truth” his description “while they know” this which you are upon. “The truth” being “from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters” those who doubt it, meaning of this type, for it is more eloquent than not doubting. “And for each” of the nations “is a direction” a qibla “to which He turns” his direction in his prayer and in the reading of its master “so race to good deeds” hasten to acts of obedience and their acceptance. “Wherever you may be, Allah will bring you all together” He will make you on the Day of Resurrection and reward you for your deeds. “Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.” “And from wherever you go out” for a journey “turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And indeed, it is the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what you do” with the letter “ya” and the letter “ta” preceded something similar and was repeated to clarify the equality of the ruling on travelling and other things. “And from wherever you go out, turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram” And wherever you are, turn your faces toward it, repeating it for emphasis, “so that the people” the Jews or the polytheists “may have no argument against you” that is, an argument about turning to something other than it, that is, so that their argument with you will be negated by the Jews’ saying, “He denies our religion and follows our qiblah,” and the polytheists’ saying, “He claims the religion of Abraham and opposes his qiblah,” “except those who are unjust among them,” by stubbornness, for they say, “He only turned to it out of inclination toward the religion of his fathers.” The exception is connected, and the meaning is, “No one will have a word against you except the word of these people.” “So do not fear them,” fear their argument about turning to it, “and fear Me,” by obeying My command, “and that I may complete,” in apposition to “me,” “My favor upon you,” by guiding you to the landmarks of your religion, “and that you may be guided,” to the truth.
j-0049	“As We have sent” is related to “completed” meaning completion as it was completed by Our sending “among you a Messenger from among you” Muhammad “who recites to you Our verses” the Qur’an “and purifies you” purifies you from polytheism “and teaches you the Book” the Qur’an “and wisdom” what is in it of rulings “and teaches you that which you did not know” “So remember Me” with prayer and glorification and the like “I will remember you” it was said that its meaning is that it means I will reward you and in the hadith about God, whoever remembers Me to himself, I will remember him to Myself and whoever remembers Me in an assembly, I will remember him in an assembly better than his assembly “and be grateful to Me” My blessings through obedience “and do not be ungrateful” through disobedience “O you who have believed, seek help” for the Hereafter “through patience” in obedience and affliction “and prayer” He singled it out for mention because of its repetition and greatness “Indeed, Allah is with the patient” with help
j-0050	"""And do not say of those who are killed in the way of Allah, 'They are dead.' Rather, they are 'alive.' Their souls are in the crops of green birds that roam in Paradise wherever they wish, according to a hadith about that, 'but you perceive not.' You know what they are in. 'And We will surely test you with something of fear,' of the enemy, 'and hunger,' drought, 'and a loss of wealth,' through destruction, 'and lives,' through killing, death, and diseases, 'and fruits,' through needs, that is, We will test you and see whether you will be patient or not. 'And give good tidings to the patient,' in the face of affliction, of Paradise. 'They are those, 'who, when a disaster strikes them,' an affliction, 'say, ""Indeed we belong to Allah,"" a king and servants who does with us as He wills, 'and indeed to Him we will return,' in the Hereafter, so He will reward us. In the hadith, whoever seeks refuge in Allah when afflicted, Allah will reward him for it and replace it with something better. In it, the lamp of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was extinguished, so he sought refuge in Allah, and Aisha said, 'This is only a lamp.' He said, 'Everything that a believer does wrong is a disaster.' Narrated by Abu Dawud in his Marasil. 'Those are the ones upon whom are blessings,' forgiveness, 'from their Lord and mercy,' a blessing. ""And those are the ones who are guided"" to the right path."
j-0051	As-Safa and Al-Marwah are two mountains in Mecca, among the symbols of Allah, the landmarks of His religion. The plural of ritual is shahada. So whoever performs Hajj or Umrah, meaning he wears the Hajj or Umrah, and their origin is intention and visitation, there is no blame upon him for circumambulating them, assimilating the taa in the original with the taa by walking between them seven times. It was revealed because the Muslims disliked that because the people of ignorance used to walk between them and they had two idols that they would touch. And from Ibn Abbas, that walking is not obligatory because of what it indicates by removing the sin from the choice. Al-Shafi’i and others said: It is a pillar, and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, explained its obligation by saying: Allah has prescribed walking for you. Narrated by Al-Bayhaqi and others. And he said: Begin with what Allah began with, meaning As-Safa. Narrated by Muslim. And whoever volunteers. And in a reading with the taa and a shaddah on the taa, in the jussive mood, and in it is the assimilation of the taa in it, khayran, meaning with good, meaning doing what is not obligatory upon him of circumambulation and other things, for Allah is grateful for his work by rewarding him for it, and is aware of it.
j-0052	And it was revealed about the Jews: “Indeed, those who conceal” from the people “what We have sent down of clear proofs and guidance” such as the verse of stoning and the description of Muhammad “after We have made it clear to the people in the Scripture” the Torah “those are cursed by Allah” He distances them from His mercy “and cursed by the cursers” the angels and the believers or everything by calling for a curse upon them “except for those who repent” return from that “and amend” their actions “and make clear” what they concealed “for those I will turn to” I accept their repentance “and I am the Accepter of Repentance, the Most Merciful” to the believers “Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers” a state “upon them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of mankind all together” meaning they deserve that in this world and the Hereafter and the people it was said are general and it was said the believers “abiding therein” meaning the curse and the fire indicated by it “the punishment will not be lightened for them” for the blink of an eye “nor will they be reprieved” given time to repent or excuse themselves
j-0053	And it was revealed when they said, “Describe to us your Lord and your God,” the One who is worthy of worship from you, “One God,” who has no equal in His essence or in His attributes, “There is no god except Him,” He is “the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,” and they asked for a sign for that, so it was revealed: “Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth,” and what is in them of wonders, “and the alternation of the night and the day,” in going and coming, and increasing and decreasing, “and the ships,” the ships, “which sail upon the sea,” and do not settle, weighed down, “with that which benefits people,” in trade and transportation, “and what God sends down from the sky of water,” rain, “and revives thereby the earth,” with vegetation, “after its lifelessness,” its dryness, “and scatters,” disperses and we drink it, “through it of every kind of moving creature,” because they grow by the fertility that comes from it, “and the changing of the winds,” turning them south and north, hot and cold, “and the clouds,” the clouds, “controlled,” subdued by the command of God Almighty, they move wherever God wills, “between the heaven and the earth,” without any connection, “are signs,” indicating His Oneness, Almighty, “for a people who reason,” who ponder.
j-0054	“And among mankind are those who take for themselves other than Allah, idols, whom they love as they love Allah, with veneration and submission. But those who believe are stronger in love for Allah than their love for other than Allah, because they do not deviate from Him in any way, and the disbelievers deviate in severity towards Allah. And if only those who did wrong could see, O Muhammad, when they saw the punishment, you would see it, in the active and passive form, you would see it, “the punishment.” You would see a great matter. And if has the meaning of if. “That,” that is, because “the power,” ability and dominance, “is Allah’s entirely,” is a state, “and that Allah is severe in punishment.” In a reading, you see, and the subject is the pronoun of the listener. It has been said that those who did wrong, and it has the meaning of knows, and that what follows it takes the place of the two objects. The answer to if is omitted, and the meaning is, if they knew in this world the severity of Allah’s punishment and that the power belongs to Allah alone at the time they witness it, which is on the Day of Resurrection, they would not have taken for themselves other than Him, “when” is a substitute for when before it, “those who followed would disown themselves,” that is, the leaders. “Of those who followed” that is, denied their misguidance “and” they “saw the punishment and the ties” that were between them in this world, such as kinship and affection, were severed “and those who followed said, ‘If only we had another chance’ to return to this world “we could disown them” that is, those who were followed “as they disowned us” today. “If only” is for wishing and “we disown” is its answer “thus” that is, as He showed them the severity of His punishment and some of them disowned others “Allah will show them their deeds” the bad ones “as regrets” a state of remorse “over them, and they will not emerge from the Fire” after entering it.
j-0055	And it was revealed about those who forbade the free-range animals and the like: “O mankind, eat from whatever is on the earth [that is] lawful,” a state, “and good,” a description that emphasizes, that is, enjoyable, “and do not follow the footsteps,” the ways, “of Satan,” that is, his adornments, “for indeed, he is to you a clear enemy,” between enmity. “He only orders you to evil,” sin, “and immorality,” that which is ugly according to the law, “and to say about God that which you do not know,” of forbidding what He has not forbidden and other things.
j-0056	“And when it is said to them,” that is, the disbelievers, “Follow what Allah has revealed,” of monotheism and the permissibility of good things, “they say,” “No, rather, we will follow what we found our fathers doing,” of worshipping idols and prohibiting the sa’iba’ and the ba’ir. God Almighty said, “Would they follow them, even though their fathers did not understand anything,” of the matter of religion, “nor were they guided,” to the truth? The hamza is for denial. “And the example,” the description of “those who disbelieve,” and of those who call them to guidance, “is like the example of one who calls out,” makes a sound, “to that which hears nothing but a call and a cry,” that is, a sound, and does not understand its meaning, that is, in hearing the sermon and not contemplating it, like the beasts that hear the voice of their shepherd but do not understand it. They are “deaf, dumb, and blind, so they do not understand,” the sermon.
j-0057	“O you who believe, eat from the good things We have provided for you and be grateful to Allah if it is Him you worship.” “He has only forbidden you dead animals” meaning eating them if the discussion is about them, and so is what comes after them, which is what is not mentioned in the Shari’ah. The Sunnah has included with them what is clear from living animals, and fish and locusts were singled out. “Blood” meaning poured out as in livestock. “And the flesh of swine” He singled out meat because it is most of what is intended and other things are subordinate to it. “And that which has been dedicated to other than Allah” meaning slaughtered in the name of someone other than Him. And the call to prayer is to raise the voice, and they used to raise it when slaughtering for their gods. “But whoever is forced” meaning necessity forces him to eat something of what has been mentioned and eats it “neither desiring (it) nor transgressing (it) by way of highway robbery, there is no sin upon him” for eating it. “Indeed, Allah is Forgiving” to His friends. “Merciful” to those who obey Him, as He has made it easy for them to do so. He has excluded the transgressor and the transgressor, and everyone who disobeys by traveling, such as the runaway and the thief, is included with them. It is not permissible for them to eat anything of that unless they repent. Shafi'i
j-0058	“Those who conceal what Allah has revealed of the Book” which includes the description of Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and they are the Jews, “and exchange it for a small price” of this world, which they take in exchange from their lowest selves, so they do not reveal it for fear of missing out on it. “Those eat nothing into their bellies except the Fire” because it is their destination. “And Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection” in anger with them, “nor will He purify them” purifies them from the filth of sins. “And for them is a painful punishment” which is the Fire. “Those are the ones who have purchased error in exchange for guidance” taking it in this world “and punishment in exchange for forgiveness” prepared for them in the Hereafter if they had not concealed it. “How patient they are with the Fire” meaning, how patient they are. This is an amazement to the believers that they have committed its causes without caring. Otherwise, what patience they have. “That” which is mentioned about their eating the Fire and what follows it “is because” because “Allah has sent down the Book in truth” is related to sent down, so they differed about it, as they believed in some of it and disbelieved in some of it by concealing it. “And those who differed about The Book” with that, and they are the Jews, and it was said the polytheists in the Qur’an, where some of them said poetry, some of them said magic, and some of them said divination, “in dissension” in disagreement “far” from the truth.
j-0059	“Righteousness is not that you turn your faces” in prayer “towards the east or the west” revealed in response to the Jews and Christians when they claimed that “but righteousness” meaning righteousness, and it was read with the opening of the ba’, meaning righteous “is he who believes in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Scripture” meaning the Scriptures “and gives wealth” despite his love for it “to relatives” relatives “and orphans and the needy and the traveler” the traveler “and those who ask” the seekers “and for” the freeing of “slaves” those who are freed and the captives “and establishes prayer and gives zakah” the obligatory and what preceded it was voluntary “and fulfills their covenant when they have made a covenant” with Allah or the people “and is patient” the accusative of praise “in poverty” severe poverty “and hardship” sickness “and at the time of battle” the time of severe fighting in the way of Allah “those” described by what was mentioned “are the ones who are true” in their faith or claim of righteousness “and those are the righteous” with Allah.
j-0060	"“O you who have believed, retribution has been prescribed for you in cases of murder: the free man, and he is not killed for the slave, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.” The Sunnah has made clear that the male is killed in retribution and that resemblance in religion is considered, so a Muslim, even a slave, is not killed for an unbeliever, even a free man. “But whoever pardons” of the two murderers “of” the blood “of his brother” of the murdered person “anything” by leaving out retribution from him and the indefiniteness of something indicates that retribution is dropped by pardoning some of it and some of the heirs. And in mentioning his brother, there is a connection calling for pardon and an indication that killing does not sever brotherhood in faith. “Min” is a conditional or relative subject and the predicate is “following” that is, the action of the pardoner is following the murderer “in a good manner” by demanding blood money from him without violence. And the arrangement of following after pardon indicates that one of them is obligatory, and it is one of the two opinions of al-Shafi’i, and the second is obligatory, retribution and blood money in exchange for it. So if he pardons and does not name it, then nothing is preferred. “And” the murderer must “pay” the blood money “to him” that is, the pardoner, who is the heir, “with kindness” without delay or reduction. “That” the mentioned ruling of the permissibility of retaliation and pardoning him for blood money “is a mitigation” facilitation “from your Lord” upon you “and a mercy” for you since He made it easy and did not make one of them obligatory as He made retaliation obligatory for the Jews and blood money for the Christians “but whoever transgresses” wrongs the killer by killing him “after that” that is pardon “will have a painful punishment” painful in the Hereafter by fire or in this world by killing
“And for you in retaliation is life” that is great permanence “O you of understanding” those with intellects because if the killer knows that he is going to kill, he is deterred and revives himself and whoever he wants to kill, it is prescribed “that you may guard against” killing out of fear of retaliation."
j-0061	“It is written” an obligation “upon you, when death approaches any of you” that is, its causes “if he leaves wealth” money “a bequest” raised by “written” and related to “if” if it is circumstantial and indicates its answer if it is conditional and the answer to “if” that is, let him make a bequest “to parents and relatives according to what is acceptable” with justice, not exceeding a third and not giving preference to the rich “as a right” a source confirming the content of the sentence before it “upon the righteous” God. This is abrogated by the verse on inheritance and by the hadith “There is no bequest for an heir” narrated by al-Tirmidhi. “But whoever changes it” that is, the bequest from a witness or a testator “after he has heard it” his knowledge “then his sin” that is, the changed bequest “is only upon those who change it” in which the apparent replaces the implicit “Indeed, God is Hearing” of the testator’s words “Knowing” of the testator’s actions, so it is permissible for him. “But whoever fears from the testator” lightened and heavy “a deviation” a deviation from the truth by mistake “or sin” by intentionally doing so by exceeding a third or singling out a rich person, for example “So make peace between them” between the testator and the one to whom the testator is entrusted by ordering justice “then there is no sin upon him” in that “for God is Forgiving and Merciful.”
j-0062	“O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous” from sins, for it breaks the desire that is its beginning. “For days” is in the accusative case with fasting or they fast for a specified period “are numbered” that is, few or fixed in a known number, which is Ramadan as will come, and He shortened it to make it easier for those who are obligated. “So whoever among you is ill or on a journey” that is, traveling on a shortened journey and fasting exhausts him in both cases and breaks his fast, “then the same number” is due on him for the number of days he broke his fast “from other days” he fasts them instead. “And for those” who cannot “strengthen it” due to old age or an illness from which there is no hope of recovery, “is a ransom” which is “the feeding of a poor person” that is, the amount he eats in his day, which is a mudd of the country’s main food for each day. In a reading with the addition of ransom, which is for clarification. It was said that it is not limited, and they were given the choice in the early days of Islam between fasting and ransom, then it was abrogated by specifying fasting with His saying, “Whoever among you witnesses the month, let him fast it.” Ibn Abbas said, “Except for the pregnant and nursing mothers if” They broke their fast out of fear for the child, so it remains without abrogation in their case. “So whoever volunteers good” by increasing the amount mentioned in the ransom “it is better for him” that is, volunteering “and that you fast” is the subject of its predicate “is better for you” than breaking the fast and the ransom “if you only knew” that it is better for you, then do it. Those days “are the month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur’an” from the Preserved Tablet to the lowest heaven on the Night of Decree from it “as guidance” a state guiding from misguidance “for mankind and clear proofs” clear verses “of guidance” with what guides to the truth from the rulings “and” of “the criterion” of what distinguishes between truth and falsehood “so whoever witnesses” is present “among you the month, let him fast it; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days” something similar has come before and was repeated so that it would not be thought that it was abrogated by generalizing whoever witnesses “Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship” and for this reason He permitted you to break the fast in illness and travel, and because that is also in the sense of the reason for the command to fast, it is conjoined with it “and that you may complete” with the lightening and emphasis “the number” that is, the number of fasts of Ramadan “And that you may glorify God” when completing it “for having guided you” He guided you to the landmarks of His religion “and perhaps you will be grateful” to God for that. The group of the Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, asked: “Is our Lord near so that we may commune with Him or far so that we may call upon Him?” So it was revealed: “And when My servants ask you concerning Me, indeed I am near” to them with My knowledge, so He informed them of that. “I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me” by granting Him what he asked for. “So let them respond to Me” My invocation with obedience “and believe” persist in believing “in Me that they may be guided” be guided.
j-0063	“Lawful to you on the night of the fast is sexual intercourse with your wives” meaning to have sexual intercourse. This was revealed to abrogate what was forbidden in the early days of Islam, and to prohibit eating and drinking after the evening meal. “They are clothing for you and you are clothing for them” a metaphor for their embrace or each one’s need for the other. “Allah knows that you were betraying” betraying “yourselves” by having sexual intercourse on the night of the fast. This happened to ‘Umar and others, and they apologized to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. “So He turned to you” before your repentance “and pardoned you. So now” since it has been made lawful for you, “have sexual intercourse with them” have intercourse with them “and seek” ask for “what Allah has decreed for you” that is, what He has permitted of sexual intercourse or has decreed of children. “And eat and drink” the entire night “until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct” appears “for you from the black thread” that is, the truth is an explanation of the white thread, and the explanation of the black is omitted, that is, from the night. He likened what appears of whiteness and what extends with it of ambiguity to two threads, white and black in extension. “Then complete the fast” from dawn “until the night.” That is, until he enters at sunset. “And do not have sexual relations with them” that is, your women “while you are in retreat” staying with the intention of retreat “in the mosques” related to “in retreat” a prohibition for whoever goes out while in retreat and has sexual relations with his wife and returns. “Those” the mentioned rulings “are the limits set by God” His limits for His servants so that they may stop at them. “So do not approach them” more eloquently than “do not transgress them” expressed in another verse. “Thus” as He explained to you what He mentioned, “God makes clear His verses to the people that they may fear God” His prohibitions.
j-0064	“And do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly,” that is, some of you consume the wealth of others, “and do not send it,” that is, to the rulers as a bribe, “in order to consume,” through arbitration, “a portion,” a group, “of the wealth of the people,” while you know that you are doing wrong.
j-0065	“They ask you,” O Muhammad, “about the new moons,” the plural of “hilal,” which does not appear for a minute, then increases until it is filled with light, then returns to how it appeared, and it is not in one state like the sun. “Say,” to them, “They are times,” the plural of “miqat,” “for the people,” by which they know the times of their planting and their trade, the number of their wives, their fasting and breaking their fasts, “and the Hajj,” in apposition to “the people,” meaning that the time of it is known, for if it remained in one state, that would not be known. “And righteousness is not that you enter houses from their backs,” in ihram like others, by digging a hole in them, entering and exiting through it and leaving the door open. They used to do that and claim that it was righteousness. “But righteousness,” that is, righteousness, “is he who fears,” God by refraining from disobeying Him, “and enter houses from their doors,” in ihram, “and fear God that you may succeed,” in ihram, “and be victorious.”
j-0066	"When Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, was prevented from the House in the year of Hudaybiyyah and made peace with the infidels on the condition that he would return the following year and leave Mecca for him for three days and prepare for the Umrah of al-Qada’, and they feared that the Quraysh would not fulfill their obligation and they would fight them, and the Muslims hated fighting them in the Sacred Sanctuary, in the state of ihram, and in the sacred month, the verse was revealed: “And fight in the way of God” meaning to exalt His religion “those who fight you” the infidels “and do not transgress” against them by initiating the fighting “for God does not like transgressors” those who exceed the limits set for them. This was abrogated by the verse of Bara’ah or by His saying: “And kill them wherever you find them” you find them “and expel them from where they expelled you” meaning from Mecca, and this was done to them in the year of the conquest. “And persecution” their polytheism “is more severe” greater “than killing” them in the Sacred Sanctuary or in the state of ihram, which you considered great. “And do not fight them at al-Masjid al-Haram” meaning in the Sacred Sanctuary “until they fight you there. But if they fight you” there “then kill them” there and in a reading without an alif in the three verbs “such is” killing and expulsion “the recompense.” ""The disbelievers""

""But if they desist"" from disbelief and submit ""then indeed, Allah is Forgiving"" to them ""and Merciful"" to them

""And fight them until there is no"" there is ""fitnah"" polytheism ""and the religion"" worship ""is for Allah"" alone, and no one is worshipped except Him. ""But if they desist"" from polytheism, then do not transgress against them, this is indicated by ""then there is no transgression"" transgression by killing or otherwise ""except against the wrongdoers"" and whoever desists is not a wrongdoer, so there is no transgression against him

""The sacred month"" the forbidden is the opposite of ""the sacred month"" so whenever they fight you in it, kill them in its likeness, because the Muslims consider that to be a great sin ""and the sacred things"" the plural of sacredness is what must be respected ""are retaliation"" that is, retaliation is in kind if they are violated ""So whoever transgresses against you"" by fighting in the sanctuary or in the state of ihram or the sacred month ""then transgress against him in the likeness of his transgression against you"" He called his opposite transgression because of its resemblance to its opposite in form ""and fear Allah"" in victory and refraining from transgression ""and know that Allah is with the righteous"" with aid and victory"
j-0067	“And spend in the cause of God” obeying Him through jihad and other things “and do not throw yourselves with your own hands” meaning yourselves, and the “ba” is redundant “into destruction” destruction by withholding spending in jihad or abandoning it because it strengthens the enemy against you “and do good” by spending and other things “for God loves the doers of good” meaning He rewards them.
j-0068	"“And complete the Hajj and Umrah for Allah.” Perform them according to their rights. “But if you are prevented,” prevented from completing them by an enemy, “then whatever is easy,” is easy for you, “of the sacrificial animal,” which is a sheep. “And do not shave your heads,” that is, do not become released from ihram, “until the sacrificial animal reaches its place,” where it is permissible to slaughter it, which is the place of confinement according to al-Shafi’i, so it is slaughtered there with the intention of becoming released from ihram and distributed to its poor people, and he is shaved, and with that he becomes released from ihram. “But whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head,” such as lice or a headache, so he shaves while in ihram, “he must offer a ransom,” upon him, “of fasting,” three days, “or charity,” three sa’s of the country’s staple food for six poor people, “or sacrifice,” that is, slaughtering a sheep. “Or” is for choice, and he included with him whoever shaves without an excuse, he is more deserving of expiation, and likewise whoever enjoys something other than shaving, such as perfume, clothing, or oil, due to an excuse or otherwise. “But when you are safe,” from the enemy, whether he has gone or not, “then whoever enjoys,” enjoys, “the Umrah,” that is, because he has completed it with the prohibitions of ihram. “To the Hajj,” that is, to the state of ihram for it, by entering ihram for it during its months, “then whatever is easy,” what is easy, “of the sacrificial animal,” which is a sheep that he slaughters after entering ihram for it, and the best is the day of sacrifice. “And whoever cannot find,” the sacrificial animal because he has lost it or lost its price, “then he must fast,” that is, he must fast “three days during the Hajj,” that is, while in ihram for it. In that case, he must enter ihram before the seventh of Dhul-Hijjah, and the best is before the sixth because fasting on the day of Arafah is disliked, and it is not permissible to fast on the days of Tashreeq according to the most correct of the two opinions of al-Shafi’i. “And seven when you return,” to your homeland, Mecca or elsewhere. It was said that when you have finished the rituals of Hajj, and in this there is a shift from absence. “That is ten complete days,” a sentence emphasizing what came before it. “That,” the aforementioned ruling of the obligation of the sacrificial animal or fasting for the one who enjoys, “is for the one whose family is not present at al-Masjid al-Haram,” that is, they are not less than two stages from the sanctuary according to al-Shafi’i. If so, then there is no blood sacrifice or fasting on him, and if he enjoys it, then he must do that, and this is one of two opinions according to al-Shafi’i. The second is no, and the family is a metaphor for the self, and it is added. By enjoying what was mentioned in the Sunnah of the Qarin, which is the one who enters into ihram for Umrah and Hajj together, or the Hajj is included in it before Tawaf. “And fear Allah” in what He commands you to do and forbids you. “And know that Allah is severe in penalty” for those who disobey Him. “The Hajj” its time “is in well-known months” Shawwal, Dhul-Qa’dah, and ten nights of Dhul-Hijjah. It was said that it was all of them. “So whoever has made Hajj obligatory” upon himself “therein” by entering into ihram for it “there shall be no sexual relations” sexual intercourse therein “nor wickedness” sins “nor disputing” quarreling “during Hajj.” In a reading with the opening of the first two, what is meant in the three is the prohibition. “And whatever good you do” such as charity “Allah knows it” so He will reward you for it. It was revealed about the people of Yemen, and they used to perform Hajj without provisions, so it would be a burden on the people. “And take provisions” what will carry you for your journey. “For indeed, the best provision is piety” what is used to protect oneself from asking people and other things. “And fear Allah, O you of understanding” those of reason. “There is no blame upon you” in “seek” you ask for “bounty” provision “from your Lord” by trading in Hajj was revealed in response to their dislike of it. “So when you depart” you set out “from Arafat” after standing there “then remember Allah” after spending the night in Muzdalifah by chanting the Talbiyah, Tahlil and supplication “at the sacred monument” which is a mountain at the end of Muzdalifah called Quzah. In the hadith, he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stood there remembering Allah and supplicating until it became very light. Narrated by Muslim. “And remember Him as He has guided you” to the landmarks of His religion and the rituals of His Hajj. The kaf is for explanation. “And if” is lightened “you were before that” before His guidance “among those who went astray.” “Then depart” O Quraysh “from where the people depart” that is, from Arafat by standing there with them, and they used to stand at Muzdalifah out of disdain for standing with them. “Then” is for the order of remembrance. “And ask forgiveness of Allah” for your sins. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving” to the believers. “Merciful” to them. “So when you have completed” you have performed “your rites” the acts of worship of your Hajj by throwing stones at Jamrat al-Aqaba and circumambulating and settling in Mina. “Then remember Allah” By glorifying and praising “as you remember your fathers” as you used to remember them when you finished your pilgrimage with boasting “or with a greater remembrance” than your mentioning them. The accusative of “more” is in the state of mentioning the accusative of “remember” because if it had been delayed, it would have been a description of it. “And among the people is he who says, ‘Our Lord, give us’ a share in this world” and he is given it “and he will have no share in the Hereafter” a share. “And among them is he who says, ‘Our Lord, give us in this world that which is good’ a blessing “and in the Hereafter that which is good’ which is Paradise “and protect us from the punishment of the Fire” by not entering it. This is a statement of what the polytheists were like and the state of the believers. The intention behind it is to urge people to seek the best of both worlds, as He promised reward for it by saying: “Those will have a share” a reward “for what they have earned” the work they did of pilgrimage and supplication “and God is swift in account” He will account for all creation in the amount of half a day of the days of this world, according to a hadith about that. “And remember God” by glorifying when throwing the pebbles “during the appointed days” meaning the three days of Tashreeq “and whoever hastens” meaning rushes to depart From Mina “in two days” meaning on the second day of Tashreeq after throwing the pebbles “there is no sin upon him” for hastening “and whoever delays” it until he spends the night of the third and throws the pebbles “there is no sin upon him” for that meaning they have a choice in that and the sin is negated “for him who fears” God in his pilgrimage because he is the pilgrim in reality “and fear God and know that to Him you will be gathered” in the Hereafter and He will reward you for your deeds

j-0069	“And among the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life,” but whose contradiction to his belief does not please you in the Hereafter. “And he calls Allah to witness as to what is in his heart,” that he agrees with his speech. “But he is the most bitter of opponents,” fiercely hostile to you and your followers because of his enmity towards you. He is Al-Akhns bin Shuraiq. He was a hypocrite who spoke sweetly to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace. He would swear that he believed in him and loved him, so he would come near to him. God denied him in that. He passed by the crops and donkeys of some Muslims and burned them and hamstrung them at night, as God Almighty said. “And when he turns away,” he turns away from you, “he strives,” he walks, “throughout the land to cause corruption therein and destroy crops and livestock,” among other corruption. “And God does not love corruption,” that is, He is not pleased with it. “And when it is said to him, ‘Fear God,’ in your actions, pride seizes him,” his arrogance and zeal lead him to commit “the sin,” which he was commanded to avoid. “So sufficient for him is Hell, and an evil resting place,” the bed is it. “And among the people is he who buys,” he sells, “his soul,” that is, he spends it in obedience to God. “Seeking” to seek “the pleasure of God” His pleasure, and when the polytheists harmed him, Suhaib migrated to Medina and left them his money. “And God is Kind to His servants” as he guided them to what pleases Him.
j-0070	And it was revealed about Abdullah bin Salam and his companions when they glorified the Sabbath and hated camels after Islam: “O you who have believed, enter into peace” with the opening of the seen and its breaking, Islam “entirely” a state of peace, i.e. in all its laws, “and do not follow the footsteps” of “Satan” i.e. his adornment with division, “for indeed he is to you a clear enemy” between enmity. “But if you slip” you turn away from entering into all of it “after the clear proofs have come to you” the clear arguments that it is true, “then know that Allah is Exalted in Might” nothing is beyond His ability to take revenge on you, “Wise” in His creation. “Are they” what “awaiting” those who abandon entering into it “except that Allah should come to them” i.e. His command, as He says, “or the command of your Lord should come” i.e. His punishment “in the shades” plural of shade “of the clouds” the clouds “and the angels, and the matter is decided” the matter of their destruction is completed, “and to Allah are matters returned” in the passive and active construction in the Hereafter, so He will reward each according to his work.
j-0071	“Ask,” O Muhammad, “the Children of Israel,” in rebuke, “how many We have given them,” “how many” is an interrogative, suspended, ask about the second object, and it is the second object of “we have given” and its distinguishing feature, “of a clear sign,” apparent like the splitting of the sea and the sending down of manna and quails, but they changed it into disbelief. “And whoever changes the favor of Allah,” that is, the signs He bestowed upon him because they are the cause of guidance, “after they have come to him,” into disbelief, “then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty,” to him. “He has made fair-seeming to those who disbelieve,” from the people of Mecca, “the life of this world,” by deception, so they loved it, “and” they “ridicule those who believe,” because of their poverty, like Bilal, Ammar, and Suhayb, that is, they mock them and are haughty towards them with money. “And those who fear Allah,” polytheism, and they are these, “will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah provides for whom He wills without account,” that is, abundant provision in the Hereafter or in this world, so that the mocked among them owns the money and necks of the mockers.
j-0072	“Mankind was one community” in faith, then they differed, some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. “Then Allah sent the prophets” to them “bringing good tidings” to those who believed of Paradise “and warning” to those who disbelieved of Hell. “And He sent down with them the Scripture” in the sense of the Books “with the truth” related to “sent down” “to judge” with it “between the people concerning that in which they differed” of religion. “And no one differed therein” meaning the religion “except those who were given it” meaning the Scripture, so some believed and some disbelieved “after the clear proofs had come to them” the clear arguments for monotheism. “Min” is related to “difference” and it and what follows it are presented before the exception in meaning “out of envy” on the part of the disbelievers “among themselves. So Allah guided those who believed to that in which they differed of” for clarification “the truth. And Allah guides whom He wills” His guidance “to a straight path” the path of truth. And it was sent down regarding the hardship that befell the Muslims. “Or” rather, “did you think that you would enter Paradise while” “there has not come to you the like” similar to what came “to those who passed on before you” of the believers from trials, so be patient as they were patient. “They were touched” is a renewed sentence explaining what preceded it “by hardship” is severe poverty “and distress” is illness “and they were shaken” they were disturbed by various types of affliction “until the Messenger and those who believed with him said” in the accusative and nominative, meaning he said “when” is the imminence of victory because the hardship had reached its end for them “will come” “the victory of Allah” which He promised us, so they responded from Allah “unquestionably, the victory of Allah is near” its coming
j-0073	“They ask you,” O Muhammad, “what they should spend,” meaning what they should spend. The questioner was Amr ibn al-Jamuh, who was an old man with wealth. He asked the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, about what he should spend and on whom he should spend. “Say,” to them, “Whatever you spend of good,” a statement of what includes both little and much. It includes a statement of the spender, which is one part of the question. He answered about the expenditure, which is the other part, by saying, “For parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer,” meaning they are more deserving of it. “And whatever good you do,” spending or otherwise, “then indeed, God is Knowing of it,” so he rewarded him.
j-0074	"“He has written” an obligation “upon you fighting” against the infidels “while it is hateful” hated “to you” of course because of its hardship “and perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you” because of the soul’s inclination towards desires that lead to its destruction and its aversion to obligations that lead to its happiness. Perhaps there is good for you in fighting, even if you hate it, because in it is either victory and spoils or martyrdom and reward, and in abandoning it, even if you love it, there is evil because in it is humiliation, poverty and deprivation of reward. “And God knows” what is best for you “while you do not know” that, so hasten to do what He commands you to do. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, sent out his first expedition led by Abdullah ibn Jahsh, and they fought the polytheists and killed Ibn al-Hadrami on the last day of Jumada al-Akhira. Rajab was confused for them, so the infidels reproached them for making it permissible, so the verse was revealed “They ask you about the sacred month” Muharram “fighting therein” instead of inclusion. “Say” to them “fighting therein is a great sin” a great subject and predicate “and turning away.” The subject is preventing people “from the path of Allah” His religion “and disbelieved in Him” in Allah “and” preventing “the Sacred Mosque” i.e. Mecca “and expelling its people from it” they are the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the believers and the predicate of the subject is “greater” greater in sin “in the sight of Allah” than fighting in it “and persecution” polytheism from you “is greater than killing” for you in it “and they will not cease” i.e. the disbelievers “fighting you” O believers “until” so that “you are returned” to disbelief “if they are able. And whoever among you reverts from his religion and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds” righteous “in this world and the Hereafter” are in vain so that they are not counted and there is no reward for them and the restriction of death upon him indicates that if he returns to Islam his work is not invalidated so he is rewarded for it and does not repeat it like the Hajj, for example, and Al-Shafi’i agrees with that “and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally”

And since the secret thought that if they were saved from sin they would not receive any reward, it was revealed “Indeed, those who believed and those who emigrated” left their homelands “and strove in the cause of Allah” To exalt His religion. “Those are the ones who hope for the mercy of God,” His reward. “And God is Forgiving,” to the believers, “Merciful” to them."
j-0075	“They ask you about wine and gambling.” What is the ruling on them? “Say” to them, “In them is great sin.” Great. In a reading with the letter “th” because of the quarreling, insults, and obscene speech that results from them. “And [there is] some benefit for people.” In the pleasure and joy of wine and the acquisition of wealth without effort in gambling. “But their sin” meaning the corruption that results from them “is greater” greater “than their benefit.” When it was revealed, some people drank it and others abstained from it until the verse of the Table forbade it. “And they ask you what they should spend.” That is, what it was estimated. “Say” Spend “that which is beyond need.” That is, what is in excess of need. Do not spend what you need and waste yourselves. In a reading with the letter “th” with the letter “th” estimated “he.” “Thus” meaning, as He explained to you what He mentioned. “God makes clear to you the verses that you may reflect.”
j-0076	“In” the matter of “this world and the Hereafter,” so you take what is best for you in both. “And they ask you about orphans,” and what they encounter of hardship in their affair. If they eat with them, they sin, and if they set aside what they have from their wealth and prepare food for them alone, then it is hardship. “Say, ‘Improvement for them,’ in their wealth by increasing it and your intervening, is better,’ than leaving that. “But if you mix with them,” that is, mix your spending with theirs, “they are your brothers,” that is, they are your brothers in religion, and it is the nature of a brother to mix with his brother, that is, you have that. “And Allah knows the corrupter,” of their wealth by mixing with him, “from the reformer,” with it, so He will punish both of them. “And if Allah had willed, He could have made it difficult for you by forbidding mixing. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might,” dominant in His affair, “Wise,” in His making. “And do not marry,” O Muslims, “polytheistic women,” that is, disbelieving women, “until they believe. And a believing slave woman is better than a polytheistic woman,” a free woman, because the reason for its revelation is the shame on the one who marries a slave woman and its encouragement. In marrying a free polytheist woman, “even if she pleases you,” for her beauty and wealth. This is specific to non-People of the Book in the verse: “And do not marry,” marry “polytheists,” that is, disbelieving believing women, “until they believe. And a believing slave is better than a polytheist, even if he pleases you,” for his wealth and beauty. “Those,” that is, the polytheists, “invite to the Fire,” by inviting you to do the deeds that necessitate it, so their marriages are not appropriate. “And God invites,” through the tongues of His messengers, “to Paradise and forgiveness,” that is, the deeds that necessitate them, “by His permission,” by His will, so it is obligatory to respond to Him by marrying His saints. “And He makes clear His verses to the people that perhaps they will be reminded,” to be admonished.
j-0077	"""And they ask you about menstruation,"" that is, menstruation or its place, what is done to women during it. ""Say: It is a harmful thing,"" filth or its place. ""So keep away from women,"" refrain from intercourse with them, ""during menstruation,"" that is, its time or place. ""And do not approach them,"" with intercourse, ""until they are pure,"" with a sukoon on the ta' and a shaddah on the ha', and in it the ta' in the original is assimilated into the ta', that is, they wash themselves after it has stopped. ""And when they have purified themselves, then come to them,"" with intercourse, ""from where Allah has commanded you,"" by avoiding it during menstruation, which is the vagina, and do not go beyond it to anything else. ""Indeed, Allah loves,"" rewards and honors, ""those who repent,"" from sins, ""and loves those who purify themselves,"" from impurities. ""Your women are a place of cultivation for you,"" that is, the place of your crops, the child. ""So come to your place of cultivation,"" that is, its place, which is the vagina, ""however,"" how ""you wish,"" from standing, sitting, lying down, facing and turning away. It was revealed in response to the Jews' saying, ""Whoever comes to his wife in her vagina,"" that is, from her anus, the child will be born cross-eyed."" “And prepare for yourselves” righteous deeds, such as saying Bismillah before intercourse, “and fear God” in His commands and prohibitions, “and know that you will meet Him” at the resurrection, so He will reward you for your deeds, “and give good tidings to the believers” who feared Him, of Paradise."
j-0078	“And do not make Allah” that is, swearing by Him “an object” a reason preventing “your oaths” that is, a share of them by swearing by Him often “that you” do not “be righteous and fear Allah” so swearing on that basis is disliked and breaking it is recommended and expiation is required, unlike doing righteousness and the like, so it is obedience “and make peace between people” meaning do not refrain from doing what was mentioned of righteousness and the like if you swear on it, rather do it and disbelieve because the reason for its revelation was to refrain from that “and Allah is Hearing” of your words “and Knowing” of your conditions “and Allah will not hold you accountable for what is unintentional” in your oaths “which is what the tongue rushes to without intending to swear such as “I swear by Allah” and “Yes by Allah” so there is no sin in it and no expiation “but He will hold you accountable for what your hearts have earned” that is, what you intended of oaths if you broke it “and Allah is Forgiving” for what was unintentional “and Forbearing” in delaying punishment for those who deserve it
j-0079	“For those who swear not to have sexual intercourse with their wives, there is a waiting period of four months. If they return [to their wives], then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. But if they decide on divorce, then indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing of their decision.”
j-0080	"“And divorced women shall wait” that is, they shall wait “concerning themselves” from marriage “three menstrual periods” that pass from the time of divorce. The plural of “Qur’” with the opening of the qaf is purity or menstruation. There are two opinions. This is for those who have been consummated with. As for others, there is no waiting period for them, according to the statement “There is no waiting period for you over them.” And for those other than those who have despaired of their menstrual periods and the young girl, their waiting period is three months. And for pregnant women, their waiting period is until they give birth, as in Surat At-Talaq and Surat At-Talaq. And for slave girls, their waiting period is two menstrual periods according to the Sunnah. “And it is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs” of children and menstruation “if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands” their husbands “have more right to take them back” by returning to them even if they refuse “in that” that is, during the waiting period “if they desire reconciliation” between them to harm the woman, and this is an incitement to intend it, not a condition for the permissibility of taking them back. This is in the case of a revocable divorce, and it is more deserving, and there is no preference in it, since others have no right to marry them during the waiting period. “And they” over their husbands “have the same as” they have “over them” of rights. ""With kindness"" in the Shari'ah, from good treatment and refraining from harm and the like. ""And men have a degree over women"" a virtue in the right of their obedience to them for what they have given of dowry and spending. ""And Allah is Exalted in Might"" in His kingdom, ""Wise"" in what He has planned for His creation. ""Divorce"" means the divorce after which one can revoke it ""twice"" means two times. ""Then either keep"" means you must keep them after it by revoking them ""with kindness"" without harm ""or release"" means sending them ""with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you"" O husbands ""to take back from what you have given them"" of dowries ""anything"" if you divorce them ""unless they fear"" means the spouses ""that they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah"" means that they will not fulfill what He has set for them of rights. And in the reading ""yakhāfa"" in the passive form, then ""that they will not keep within"" is a substitute for inclusion from the pronoun in it. And it was read with the superior in both verbs. ""But if you fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon them"" ""for that by which she ransoms herself"" from Money to divorce her, that is, there is no blame on the husband for taking it, nor on the wife for giving it. “Those” the mentioned rulings “are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - those are the wrongdoers.” “But if he divorces her” the husband after the two divorces “then she is not lawful to him afterward” after the third divorce “until she marries” marries “another husband” and he has intercourse with her, as in the hadith narrated by the two sheikhs. “But if he divorces her” that is, the second husband “then there is no blame upon them” that is, the wife and the first husband “if they return” to marriage after the expiration of the waiting period “if they think that they can keep within the limits of Allah. And those” the mentioned rulings “are the limits of Allah which He makes clear to a people who know” who reflect."
j-0081	“And when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term,” their waiting period is about to expire, “then keep them,” by taking them back “according to kindness,” without harm, “or release them on kindness,” leave them until their waiting period is over, “and do not keep them,” by taking them back, “to cause harm,” an object for which, “in order to transgress,” against them by forcing them to ransom, divorce, or prolong their imprisonment. “And whoever does that has wronged himself,” by exposing herself to the punishment of God. “And do not take the verses of God in jest,” mocked by disobeying them. “And remember the favor of God upon you,” by Islam, “and what He has sent down to you of the Book,” the Qur’an, “and wisdom,” the rulings in it, “instructing you thereby,” so that you thank Him by acting upon it. “And fear God and know that God is Knowing of all things,” and nothing is hidden from Him. “And when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term,” their waiting period has expired, “do not prevent them,” addressing the guardians, meaning, prevent them “from marrying their husbands,” those who divorce them, because the reason for It was revealed that the sister of Muqal ibn Yasar was divorced by her husband, so he wanted to take her back, but Muqal ibn Yasar prevented her, as Al-Hakim narrated. “If they agree,” that is, the husbands and women, “between themselves in what is acceptable,” according to the Shari’ah. “That,” the prohibition of preventing marriage, “is admonished to whoever among you believes in God and the Last Day,” because he is the one who benefits from it. “That,” that is, abandoning preventing marriage, “is purer,” better, “for you and cleaner,” for you and for them, because of what is feared for the spouses from suspicion because of the relationship between them. “And God knows,” what is in the best interest, “and you do not know,” so follow His commands.
j-0082	“Mothers shall suckle” that is, they shall suckle “their children for two complete years” two years, a description that emphasizes that “for him who wishes to complete the nursing” and no more. “And upon the father of the child” that is, the father “is their provision” feeding the mothers “and clothing” for the nursing if they are divorced “in an equitable manner” according to his ability. “No soul shall be charged except [with that within] its capacity.” “No mother shall be harmed on account of her child” that is, because of him by forcing her to nurse him if she refuses. “Nor shall a father be harmed on account of his child” that is, because of him by being forced to nurse him if she refuses. “And upon the heir” that is, the father’s heir, who is the boy, that is, upon his guardian in his wealth “is the same” as upon the father for the mother in terms of provision and clothing. “But if they both desire” that is, the parents “weaning” by mutual consent and consultation between them so that the boy’s interest in it becomes clear, “there is no blame upon them” in that. “But if you desire” addressing the fathers “to have [others] nursed [others].” “Your children” are wet nurses other than your mothers “there is no blame upon you” in that “if you hand over” to them “what you have given” that is, if you intended to give them as wages “according to what is acceptable” in a kind and generous manner “and fear God and know that God is Seeing of what you do” nothing of it is hidden from Him.
j-0083	“And those among you who die and leave behind wives, they shall wait” that is, to wait “concerning themselves” after marriage “four months and ten” of nights. This is for those who are not pregnant. As for pregnant women, their waiting period is until they give birth according to the verse of divorce, and the female slave is entitled to half of that in a year. “And when they have reached their term” the period of their waiting period has ended, “there is no blame upon you” O guardians, “for what they do with themselves” of adorning themselves and exposing oneself to speech “in an acceptable manner” according to the law. “And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.” He knows its inner meaning as well as its outer meaning. “And there is no blame upon you for what you display” you hint at “of proposing to women” whose husbands have died during their waiting period, such as a person saying, for example, “You are truly beautiful, and who can find someone like you? And there is a Lord who desires you” “or conceal” you conceal “within yourselves” of intending to marry them. “Allah knows that you will mention them” by proposing and not be patient without them, so He has permitted you to hint at it. “But do not make a secret promise to them” i.e. marriage “except” but “that you speak a proper word” i.e. what is known to you by the Shari’ah of insinuation, so you may do that “and do not resolve to tie the knot of marriage” i.e. to conclude it “until the prescribed period” i.e. the written waiting period “has come to an end” i.e. it ends “and know that Allah knows what is in your souls” of resolve and other things “so beware of Him” lest He punish you if you resolve “and know that Allah is Forgiving” to those who warn Him “and Forbearing” in delaying punishment for those who deserve it “There is no blame upon you if you divorce women before you have touched them” in another reading “have touched them” i.e. have had intercourse with them “or” have not “assigned to them a dowry” a dowry, and “ma” is a circumstantial source, i.e. there is no responsibility upon you in divorce at a time when there is no contact and the imposition is sinful and there is no dowry, so divorce them “and give them something to enjoy” “on the wealthy” the rich among you “according to his measure and on the poor” the one in need of sustenance “according to his measure” indicating that there is no consideration for the measure The wife is “a provision” (mut’a) “enjoyment” (in a good manner) (Shari’ah) as an attribute of provision “a right” (a second attribute or an emphatic source) “upon the doers of good” (the obedient ones). “And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already specified for them a dowry, then half of what you specified” (the wives) is due to them and the half returns to you “unless” (but) “they forgive” (i.e. the wives) so they leave it “or he in whose hand is the marriage contract forgives” (i.e. the husband) so he leaves her everything. According to Ibn Abbas, the guardian if she is incapacitated, there is no harm in that “and that you forgive” (i.e. the subject is its predicate) “is closer to righteousness. And do not forget graciousness between you” (i.e. that some of you do good to others). “Indeed, Allah is Seeing of what you do” (i.e. the wives) so he will reward you for it.
j-0084	"“Guard the prayers” the five prayers by performing them at their appointed times “and the middle prayer” is the afternoon, morning, noon or other sayings and he mentioned it alone for its virtue “and stand before God” in prayer “devoutly” it was said obediently because of the saying of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “every devoutness in the Qur’an is obedience” narrated by Ahmad and others. And it was said silently because of the hadith of Zayd ibn Arqam “we used to talk during prayer until this verse was revealed and we were commanded to be silent and forbidden from talking” narrated by the two sheikhs
“but if you fear” an enemy or a flood or a wild animal “on foot” the plural of “rajil” meaning pedestrians, pray “or riding” the plural of “rakeb” meaning however possible facing the qiblah or other and gesturing for bowing and prostration “but when you are secure” from fear “then remember God” meaning pray “as He taught you that which you did not know” before teaching Him of its obligations and rights. The kaf means like and ma is a source or relative"
j-0085	"“And those of you who die and leave wives behind them” let them make a bequest “for their wives” and give them “a provision” what they enjoy of maintenance and clothing “until” the completion of “a year without turning them out” a state, meaning not turning them out of their dwellings “but if they go out” by themselves “there is no blame upon you” O guardians of the deceased “for what they do with themselves of what is right” according to the law, such as adorning themselves, leaving the mourning period, and cutting off maintenance for them “and Allah is Exalted in Might” in His kingdom “and Wise” in His creation, and the aforementioned bequest was abrogated by the verse of inheritance and waiting for a year by the previous verse of four months and ten that came later in its revelation and the residence is established for it according to Al-Shafi’i, may God have mercy on him. “And for divorced women is a provision” they are given “according to what is right” as much as possible “a right” in the accusative case with its implied verb “upon the righteous” God Almighty repeated it to include the possessed as well, since the previous verse is in other than it
“Likewise” as what was mentioned explains to you “God makes clear to you His verses that you may understand.”"
j-0086	“Have you not seen” is an interrogative of astonishment and suspense to listen to what comes after it, meaning your knowledge ends “at those who left their homes, and they were thousands” four or eight or ten or thirty or forty or seventy thousand “for fear of death” is the object for which they were a people from the Children of Israel who were afflicted with the plague and fled “and God said to them, ‘Die’” so they died “then He revived them” after eight days or more by the supplication of their prophet Ezekiel with a broken silent letter and the qaf and a silent zay so they lived for a long time with the traces of death on them, not wearing a garment except that it became like a shroud and it continued among their tribes “Indeed, God is full of bounty to mankind” and from this is the revival of these “but most of the people” and they are the disbelievers “are not grateful” the purpose of mentioning the news of these people is to encourage the believers to fight and that is why it is connected to it “and fight in the cause of God” that is to exalt His religion “and know that God is Hearing” of your words “Knowing” of your conditions and will reward you “Who is it that would loan God” by spending his money in the cause of God “a goodly loan” By spending it for God Almighty with a good heart, “He will multiply it” and in another reading, “He will multiply it for him many times over” from ten to more than seven hundred as will come. “And God withholds” He withholds provision from whomever He wills as a test “and expands” He expands it for whomever He wills as a test “and to Him you will be returned” in the Hereafter by resurrection, and He will reward you for your deeds.
j-0087	“Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after the death of Moses, when they said to a prophet of theirs, Samuel: ‘Send us a king, with whom we may fight in the cause of God. ’ He said: ‘Would you not fight if fighting is prescribed for you? ’ They said: ‘Why should we not fight in the cause of God when we have been driven out from our homes and our children? ’ They said: ‘And when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. ’ They said: ‘And God is Knowing of the wrongdoers. ’ They said: ‘And God will punish them. ’ They said: ‘And why should we not fight in the cause of God when we have been driven out from our homes and our children? ’ They said: ‘And God will punish them. ’ They said: ‘But when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, except for a few of them. ’ They said: ‘And God is Knowing of the wrongdoers. ’ They said: ‘And God will punish them. ’ And the prophet asked to send a king, so he answered him by sending Talut.
j-0088	“And their prophet said to them, ‘Indeed, Allah has sent you Saul as a king.’ They said, ‘How can he have kingship over us when we are more deserving of kingship than he?’” Because he was not from the tribe of the kingdom or the prophethood, and he was a tanner or a shepherd, “and he has not been given ample wealth” to help him establish the kingdom. “He said,” the prophet to them, “Indeed, Allah has chosen him” He chose him for kingship “over you and has increased him abundantly” in knowledge and body. He was the most knowledgeable of the Children of Israel at that time, the most beautiful of them, and the most perfect in character. “And Allah gives His kingdom to whom He wills.” There is no objection to giving it. “And Allah is Bountiful” His favor. “Knowing” of who is worthy of it. “And their prophet said to them,” when they asked him for a sign of his kingship, “Indeed, the sign of his kingship is that the Ark will come to you,” the chest that contained the images of the prophets. Allah sent it down to Adam and it continued to them, but the giants overcame them and took it. They used it to seek victory over their enemy and advance it in battle and find peace in it, as Allah the Most High said. “In it is tranquility” reassurance for your hearts “from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Adam left behind.” Moses and the family of Aaron” meaning they left him and it was Moses’ sandals, his staff, Aaron’s turban, a handful of manna that was sent down to them, and fragments of tablets “carried by angels” a state of the subject of “comes to you”. “Indeed in that is a sign for you” of his kingdom “if you are believers”. So the angels carried him between heaven and earth while they were looking at him until they placed him with Talut, so they acknowledged his kingdom and hastened to jihad, so he chose seventy thousand of their young men.
j-0089	"“So when he departed,” Talut went out “with the soldiers” from Jerusalem and the heat was intense and they asked him for water, “he said, ‘Indeed, Allah will test you’ with a river’ to show who among you is obedient and who is disobedient, and it is between the Jordan and Palestine. ‘So whoever drinks from it’ that is, from its water, ‘is not of me’ that is, of my followers, ‘and whoever does not taste it’ tastes it ‘is of me, except for one who takes a handful’ with his hand’ and is satisfied with it and does not add anything more, for he is of me. ‘So they drank from it’ when they came to him in large numbers, ‘except for a few of them’ so they limited themselves to a handful. It was narrated that it was enough for them to drink and for their animals, and they were three hundred and a few men. ‘But when he and those who believed with him had passed it’ that is, those who had drank, ‘they said, ‘We have no strength’ that is, power ‘today against Goliath and his soldiers’ that is, to fight them, and they were cowardly and did not pass it. ‘Those who thought’ were certain ‘that they would meet Allah’ said, ‘How many’ is a piece of information. In the sense of many, “of a small group” “overcame a large group by the permission of Allah” by His will “and Allah is with the patient” with help and victory.

“And when they came forward to face Goliath and his soldiers” that is, they appeared to fight them and lined up “they said, ‘Our Lord, pour out’ pour ‘upon us patience and plant firmly our feet’ by strengthening our hearts for jihad “and give us victory over the disbelieving people.”

“So they defeated them” defeated them “by the permission of Allah” by His will “and David killed” and he was in the army of Talut “and Allah gave him” that is, David “kingdom” over the Children of Israel “and wisdom” prophethood after the death of Samuel and Talut and no one before him had combined them “and taught him of whatever He willed” such as the making of armor and the language of birds “and had Allah not repelled some people” He replaced some people “by others, the earth would have been corrupted” by the victory of the polytheists and the killing of the Muslims and the destruction of the mosques “but Allah is full of bounty to the worlds” so He repelled some of them by others

“Those” these verses “are the verses of Allah which We recite” We narrate them “Upon you,” O Muhammad, “is the truth,” the honesty, “and indeed, you are among the messengers.” The emphasis is on “that” and other things, in response to the infidels’ saying to him, “You are not a messenger.”"
j-0090	“Those” is the subject “the messengers” is an adjective or an explanatory conjunction and the predicate “We have preferred some of them over others” by singling them out with a virtue that no one else has “of them is he to whom Allah spoke” like Moses “and He raised some of them” that is Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace “in degrees” over others by the generality of the call and the seal of prophethood and the preference of his nation over all other nations and the many miracles and numerous characteristics “and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him” strengthened him “with the Holy Spirit” Gabriel who walks with him wherever he goes “and if Allah had willed” He would have guided all people “those after them” after the messengers, that is, their nations “would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them” because of their differences and the misleading of one another “but they differed” because of His will “and among them are those who believed” remained steadfast in their faith “and among them are those who disbelieved” like the Christians after Christ “and if Allah had willed they would not have fought each other” emphasis “but Allah does what He intends” of guiding whomever He wills and failing whomever He wills “O you who believe! Spend from what We have provided you” His zakat “before there comes a day in which there will be no trade” ransom “nor friendship” friendship that will benefit “nor intercession” without his permission, which is the Day of Resurrection. And in a reading with the three raised “and the disbelievers” in God or in what was imposed upon them “they are the wrongdoers” for placing God’s command in the wrong place.
j-0091	“Allah, there is no god” that is, there is no true deity in existence “except Him, the Ever-Living” the Eternal, “the Self-Sustaining” the Sustainer of all things, “He is not overtaken by drowsiness” drowsiness “nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth” in dominion, creation, and servants. “Who is it that” that is, no one “can intercede with Him except by His permission?” He knows what is before them” that is, creation “and what is behind them” that is, of the affairs of this world and the Hereafter “and they do not encompass anything of His knowledge” that is, they do not know anything of His information “except what He wills” that He teaches them from it through the news of the messengers. “His Throne encompasses the heavens and the earth” it was said that His knowledge encompasses them, and it was said that His dominion, and it was said that the Throne itself includes them because of its greatness, according to the hadith: “The seven heavens in the Throne are nothing but like seven houses thrown into a shield.” “And their preservation does not tire Him” that is, the heavens and the earth “and He is the Most High” above His creation by force, “the Great” the Grand.
j-0092	“There is no compulsion in religion” to enter it. “The right way has become clear from the wrong.” That is, it has become clear through clear verses that faith is right and disbelief is wrong. It was revealed about those who had children among the Ansar whom he wanted to force to convert to Islam. “So whoever disbelieves in Taghut” Satan or idols, and this applies to both singular and plural “and believes in Allah has grasped” has grasped “the firmest handhold” the firm contract “with no break” interruption “in it. And Allah is Hearing” of what is said, “Knowing” of what is done.
j-0093	“God is the protector” of those who believe. He brings them out from darknesses” of disbelief “into the light” of faith. “And those who disbelieve - their protectors are false gods. They bring them out from the light into darknesses.” The mention of bringing them out is either in contrast to His statement, “He brings them out from darknesses” or in every one of the Jews who believed in the Prophet before his mission and then disbelieved in him. “Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.”
j-0094	“Have you not considered him who argued with Abraham about his Lord because God had given him the kingdom?” That is, his arrogance caused him to do so because of God’s grace, and he was Nimrod. “When” instead of “argued,” “Abraham said,” when he said to him, “Who is your Lord to whom you are calling us?” “My Lord is He who gives life and causes death,” that is, He creates life and death in bodies. “He said,” he, “I give life and cause death,” by killing and pardoning him. And he called for two men, so he killed one of them and left the other. When he saw him dumb, “Abraham said,” moving on to a clearer argument than it, “Then God brings the sun from the east, so bring it from the west.” So the disbeliever was dumbfounded, perplexed and astonished. “And God does not guide the wrongdoing people,” by disbelief to the path of argument.
j-0095	"«Or» I saw «like the one» the kaf is redundant «who passed by a village» that is Jerusalem riding on a donkey and with him a basket of figs and a cup of juice and it was precious «and it was desolate» fallen «on its thrones» its fall when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed it «he said, ""How"" how ""will Allah revive this after its death"" out of awe of His Almighty power «so Allah caused him to die» and made him remain «a hundred years then He resurrected him» alive to show him how that would be «he said» the Almighty to him «how long did you remain» stayed here «he said I remained a day or part of a day» because he slept at the beginning of the day then was taken and revived at sunset so he thought it was the day of sleep «he said rather you remained a hundred years so look at your food» the figs «and your drink» the juice «it has not stale» it has not changed with the passage of time and the ha is said to be the origin of sanaht and it is said for silence from sanayt and in a reading it is deleted «and look at your donkey» how it is so he saw it dead and its bones white and shining we did that so you know «and to make you a sign» of the resurrection “For mankind, and look at the bones” of your donkey “how We raise them up” We revive them with a damma on the nun, and it is read with a fatha from anshaz and nashaz, two dialects, and in a reading with a damma on the zay, we move it and raise it, “Then We cover them with flesh” so he looked at it and it was assembled and covered with flesh and the soul was breathed into it and it brayed, “And when it became clear to him” that by observation, “he said, I know” he knew by observation “that God is over all things competent” and in a reading, I know, a command from God to him"
j-0096	“And” remember “when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead.’ He said, “Do you not believe?” He asked him, knowing that he believed in that, so that he might answer him with what he asked, so that the listeners might know his purpose? “He said, ‘Yes,’ but I asked you, ‘so that my heart might be reassured,’ with the observation that is joined to the evidence. He said, ‘Then take four birds and bring them to you,’ with the kasra and damma of the sad, and bring them to you and cut them up and mix their meat and feathers. “Then place on every mountain, of the mountains of your land, a portion of them. Then call them, to you, they will come to you running. And know that God is Exalted in Might, Wise in His creation.’ So he took a peacock, an eagle, a crow, and a rooster and did with them what was mentioned, and held their heads close to him and called them, and the parts flew toward each other until they were complete, then they came to their heads.”
j-0097	“The example” of the expenditures “of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah” that is, His obedience “is like the example of a grain [of corn] which grows seven ears, in each ear a hundred grains” so their expenditures are multiplied seven hundred times. “And Allah multiplies” more than that “for whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing” in His bounty “and Knowing” of who deserves multiplication. “Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah and do not follow up what they have spent with a ‘reproach’” to the one on whom the spending was made by saying, for example, “I have done well to him and improved his condition” “or injury” to him by mentioning that to someone who should not be stopped by it and the like. “For them is their reward” the reward for their spending “with their Lord, and there is no fear concerning them, nor shall they grieve” in the Hereafter. “A kind word” is good speech and a beautiful response to the questioner “and forgiveness” for him for his insistence “is better than charity followed by injury” by a favor and reproach for him for asking. “And Allah is Free” from the charity of the servants, “Forbearing” in delaying punishment for the one who favors and the one who causes harm. “O you who believe, do not nullify [your] ways.” Your charities” that is, their wages “with reminders and injury” in nullification “like the one” that is, like the nullification of the expenditure of the one “who spends his wealth to be seen by people” showing off to them “and does not believe in God and the Last Day” he is the hypocrite “so his example is like the example of a smooth rock” a smooth stone “upon which is dust, then a downpour” heavy rain “leaves it hard” hard and smooth, with nothing on it “they are unable” a resumption to explain the example of the hypocrite who spends to be seen by people and the pronoun is plural in consideration of the meaning of “who” “to have any power over what they have earned” what they have done, that is, they will not find any reward for it in the Hereafter, just as there is nothing on the smooth rock that was on it because the rain has washed it away “and God does not guide the disbelieving people”
j-0098	«And the example» of those who spend their wealth seeking» seeking «the pleasure of Allah and to strengthen themselves» that is, to achieve the reward for it, unlike the hypocrites who do not hope for it because of their denial of it, and from the beginning «is like the example of a garden» an orchard «on a hill» with a damma on the ra’ ​​or a fatha, a high, level place «which is struck by heavy rain, so it yields» gives «its fruit» with a damma on the kaf or a sukoon, its fruit «twice» twice as much as what others yield «but if heavy rain does not strike it, then a light drizzle» a light rain that falls on it and is sufficient for it because of its height, meaning it bears fruit and grows, whether the rain is abundant or little, so likewise the expenditures of the one mentioned grow with Allah, whether it is abundant or little «and Allah is Seeing of what you do» so He will reward you for it «would any of you like to have a garden» an orchard «of palm trees and grapevines with rivers flowing beneath it, for him therein» fruit «of all kinds of fruits» and «old age has afflicted him» so he has become weak from old age from earning «and he has offspring “Weak” young children who could not bear it “then a hurricane struck it” a strong wind “with fire in it, and it was burned” so he lost it when he needed it most and he and his children were left helpless and confused, without a means to do so. This is a metaphor for the expense of the hypocrite and the one who shows off in its disappearance and its lack of benefit when he needs it most in the Hereafter. The question is in the sense of negation. According to Ibn Abbas, it is the man who did acts of obedience, then Satan was sent to him, so he did acts of disobedience until he burned his deeds. “Thus” as he explained what he mentioned, “Allah makes clear to you the signs that you may reflect” so you may take heed.
j-0099	“O you who have believed, spend” that is, give zakat “from the good things” of what you have earned” of wealth “and from” the good things “that We have produced for you from the earth” of grains and fruits “and do not aim” intend “the bad” the poor “thereof” that is of what is mentioned “spending” in zakat is a state of the pronoun of aim “and you would not take it” that is, the bad if you gave it as part of your rights “unless you close your eyes to it” by being lenient and lowering your gaze, so how can you fulfill the right of Allah from it “and know that Allah is Free of need” of your expenditures “Praiseworthy” praised in every case. “Satan threatens you with poverty” he frightens you with it if you give charity then hold back “and orders you to immorality” miserliness and withholding zakat “and Allah promises you” for spending “forgiveness from Him” for your sins “and bounty” provision in replacement from Him “and Allah is All-Encompassing” His bounty “and Knowing” of the spender “He gives wisdom” that is, beneficial knowledge that leads to action “to whom He wills and whomsoever He wills.” “He who is given wisdom has been given much good” for his destiny is eternal happiness. “And none will be reminded” in which the ta’ in the original is assimilated into the dhal, “except those of understanding” the people of intellects.
j-0100	“And whatever you spend” whether you pay zakat or charity “or vow” and fulfill it “God knows it” and will reward you for it “and for the wrongdoers” by withholding zakat and vows or by spending in the wrong place of disobedience to God “there are no helpers” to prevent them from His punishment “If you disclose” disclose “your charitable giving” that is, voluntary acts “they are good” that is, a good thing to disclose “but if you conceal them” conceal them “and give them to the poor, it is better for you” than disclosing them and giving them to the rich. As for the obligatory charity, it is better to disclose it so that people follow his example and so that he is not accused, and giving it to the poor is obligatory “and He will expiate” with the letter “ya” and the letter “nun” in the jussive mood in conjunction with the place of “he” and raised as a resumption “from you of” some “of your misdeeds. And God is Acquainted with what you do” He knows its inner meaning as its outer meaning, nothing of it is hidden from Him.
j-0101	When the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) was forbidden from giving charity to the polytheists so that they would convert to Islam, the following was revealed: “You are not responsible for their guidance,” meaning the people to enter Islam, you are only responsible for conveying the message, “but Allah guides whom He wills,” His guidance to enter it, “and whatever you spend of good,” money, “is for yourselves,” because its reward is for them, “and you do not spend except seeking the countenance of Allah,” meaning His reward and nothing else from the worldly goods, a predicate with the meaning of prohibition, “and whatever you spend of good will be fully repaid to you,” its reward, “and you will not be wronged,” you will not be deducted from it in any way, and the two sentences are an emphasis on the first. “For the poor,” predicate of a deleted subject, meaning charity, “who are restricted in the cause of Allah,” meaning they confined themselves to jihad, it was revealed about the people of the Suffah, who were four hundred of the emigrants who were assigned to learn the Qur’an and go out with the raiding parties, “unable to travel,” traveling, “in the land,” for trade and livelihood because they were busy with jihad, “the ignorant think them,” of their condition, “rich because of their abstinence,” meaning because they were too abstaining from asking and leaving it. “You will know them,” O addressee, “by their mark,” their sign of humility and the effect of effort. “They do not ask people” for anything, so they are “insistent,” meaning they do not ask at all, so they do not be persistent, which is insistence. “And whatever you spend of good, indeed, Allah is Knowing of it,” so it is a recompense for it. “Those who spend their wealth by night and by day, secretly and publicly, will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.”
j-0102	“Those who consume interest” that is, take it, which is the increase in transactions with money and food in quantity or term “will not rise” from their graves “except” rising “as one rises who is being beaten” by Satan into insanity” madness is related to “they rise”. “That” which has befallen them “is because” because they “said, ‘Trade is only like interest’” in permissibility. This is from the opposite of simile, exaggeration. So God Almighty said in response to them “And God has permitted trade and forbidden interest. So whoever comes to him” he receives “admonition” admonition “from his Lord and desists” from consuming it “will have what is past” before the prohibition, that is, it will not be taken back from him “and his affair” in pardoning him “is up to God. But whoever returns” to consuming it, likening it to selling in permissibility “they are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally”. “God destroys interest” decreases it and takes away its blessing “and gives increase for charities” increases and grows them and multiplies their reward “and God does not like any disbeliever” in permitting interest “sinful” wicked in consuming it, that is, punish him
j-0103	"""Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds and established prayer and given zakah will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve."" ""O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains of interest if you should be believers."" Sincere in your faith, for it is the nature of the believer to obey the command of Allah the Most High. It was revealed when some of the Companions demanded, after the prohibition, interest that they had before. ""But if you do not do it,"" what you were commanded to do, ""then be permitted,"" know, ""a war from Allah and His Messenger,"" in which there is a severe threat to them. When it was revealed, they said, ""We must wage war against it. But if you repent,"" if you go back from it, ""you shall have the principal,"" the origins, of your wealth. You shall not be wronged,"" with an increase, ""nor shall you be wronged,"" with a decrease. And if a debtor in hardship falls, then give him a reprieve, that is, you must delay it until it is easy, with the opening of the seen and its closing, that is, a time when it is easy. And to give charity, with emphasis on the assimilation of the ta' in the original into the sad, and with the lightening of its deletion, that is, to give charity to the insolvent by acquitting him, is better for you if you know that it is better. So do it. In the hadith: “Whoever grants respite to a person in difficulty or forgives his debt, Allah will shelter him in His shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His shade.” Narrated by Muslim. “And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah.” It is the Day of Resurrection. “Then every soul will be compensated for what it has earned.” It has done good and evil. “And they will not be wronged.”"
j-0104	“O you who believe, when you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down, as a security and to avoid disputes. And let a scribe write it between you in justice, with the truth in writing it, neither increasing nor decreasing the money or the term. And let no scribe refuse to write, if called upon to do so, as Allah has taught him, that is, He has favored him with writing, so he should not be stingy with it. The kaf is connected to ya’ab. So let him write, to emphasize, and let him dictate to the scribe, the one upon whom the debt is owed, the debt because he is the one against whom the witness is testified, so he acknowledges so that he may know what he owes. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, in dictating, and let him not withhold from it, that is, the right, anything. But if the one upon whom the debt is owed is foolish, wasteful, or weak, unable to dictate due to young or old, or unable to dictate himself, due to muteness or ignorance of the language or the like, then let his guardian, the one in charge of his affairs, such as a parent, guardian, trustee, or translator, dictate in justice, and bring witnesses.” “Bear witness to the religion, two witnesses from among your men,” that is, adult, free Muslims. “But if there are not two men, then a man and two women from among those whom you accept as witnesses,” for his religion and justice, and the multiplicity of women, so that “lest one of them should go astray,” forget the testimony due to the deficiency of their intellect and control, “then one of them should remind,” with the emphasis and with the emphasis, “the other one,” the one who remembers, and the whole of the reminders is the place of the cause, that is, to remind that she went astray and entered into error because it is its cause. And in the reading with the kasra of “an,” conditional, and the raising of “remembrance,” is a resumption of its answer. “And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called,” to bear witness and give it. “And do not be weary,” get tired of “writing it down,” that is, what you have testified to of the truth due to the frequency of that happening, “whether it is small,” “or great,” little or much, “until its term,” the time of its occurrence, is a state of the “ha” in “you write it down.” “That,” that is, writing, “is more just,” more equitable, “with God and more upright for testimony,” that is, more helpful for Its establishment because it mentions it “and the nearest” is closer to “A” “Do not doubt” doubt the amount of the right and the term “unless it” occurs “a present trade” and in a reading in the accusative case, then it is incomplete and its name is the pronoun of trade “that you conduct among yourselves” that is, you receive it and there is no term in it “then there is no blame upon you” in “that you do not write it down” and what is meant by it is the trade in it “and bring witnesses when you make a transaction” on it because it prevents disagreement and this and what preceded it is a command of encouragement “and neither the scribe nor the witness shall be harmed” the owner of the right and the one against him by distorting or refusing to testify or write, and the owner of the right shall not harm them by charging them with what is not appropriate in writing and witnessing “and if you do” what you have been forbidden “then it is a transgression” a departure from obedience that follows “with you and fear God” in His command and prohibition “and God will teach you” the interests of your affairs, a state estimated or renewed “and God is Knowing of all things” “and if you are on a journey” that is, traveling and you borrow “and do not find a scribe, then let there be a pledge” and in a reading “pledge” is the plural of A mortgage “in possession” that you use as security. The Sunnah has made clear the permissibility of a mortgage in the city and in the presence of a scribe. So adherence to what was mentioned is more severe, and his saying “in possession” is more useful, as it stipulates possession in the mortgage and is sufficient for it from the mortgagee and his agent. “But if one of you trusts another,” meaning the creditor, the debtor, regarding his right, so he does not take a mortgage, “then let him who is trusted,” meaning the debtor, “deliver his trust,” his debt, “and let him fear God, his Lord,” in fulfilling it. “And do not conceal testimony,” if you are called upon to give it. “And whoever conceals it, then indeed his heart is sinful,” it was specifically mentioned because it is the place of testimony, and because if he sins, someone else will follow him, so he will be punished as sinners are punished. “And God is Knowing of what you do,” nothing of it is hidden from Him.
j-0105	“To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account, He will inform you of it on the Day of Resurrection. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills. The two verbs in the subjunctive mood are in apposition to the answer to the condition and the nominative, meaning He is the One. “And Allah is over all things competent,” including your accountability and recompense. “The Messenger,” Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, of the Qur’an. “And the believers,” in apposition to it, “all,” in tanween, are substitutes for the complement, “believe in Allah and His angels and His books,” in plural and singular, “and His messengers,” they say, “We make no distinction between any of His messengers,” so we believe in some and disbelieve in others, as the Jews and Christians did. “And they say, ‘We hear,’ that is, what we were commanded to do with acceptance, “and we obey, we ask You for Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the destination,” the reference is to resurrection. When the verse before it was revealed, he complained. Believers from temptations and it is difficult for them to be held accountable for it, so Allah did not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity, meaning what its capacity can bear. It will have what it has earned of good, meaning its reward, and it will bear what it has earned of evil, meaning its burden. No one will be held accountable for the sin of another, nor for what he has not earned of what his soul has tempted him with. Say, “Our Lord, do not punish us with punishment if we forget or make a mistake, or leave what is right, not intentionally, as You did for those before us.” And Allah has lifted that from this nation, as mentioned in the hadith. So his question is an acknowledgment of the blessing of Allah, “Our Lord, and do not place upon us a burden that is too heavy for us to bear, as You placed upon those before us, meaning the Children of Israel, of killing a soul in repentance, giving out a quarter of one’s wealth in zakat, and lending a place of impurity. Our Lord, and do not place upon us that which we have no strength to bear of obligations and trials, and pardon us, erase our sins, forgive us, and have mercy on us in mercy in addition to forgiveness. You are our Master, our Lord, and the One in charge of our affairs, so grant us victory over the disbelieving people by establishing proof and victory in fighting them, for it is the nature of a Master to grant victory to his allies over the enemies.” And in the hadith: When this verse was revealed and the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, recited it, he was told after every word, “You have done it.”

«He has sent down to you» O Muhammad «the Book» the Qur’an mixed «with the truth» with truth in its reports «confirming what was before it» before it of the books «and He sent down the Torah and the Gospel before» that is, before His sending down «as guidance» a state meaning two guides from misguidance «for mankind» those who followed them and He referred to them as sent down and in the Qur’an the requirement for repetition is sent down because they were sent down all at once in succession «and He sent down the Criterion» meaning the books distinguishing between truth and falsehood and He mentioned it after mentioning the three to include everything else
«Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah» the Qur’an and other things «will have a severe punishment, and Allah is Exalted in Might» dominant in His affair so nothing can prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat «possessor of retribution» severe punishment for those who disobey Him that no one is capable of achieving
«Indeed, nothing is hidden from Allah» that is, «in the earth or in the heaven» because He knows what occurs in the world of general and particular and He opposes them by mention because the senses do not go beyond them
«He is the One Who He shapes you in the wombs as He wills” of maleness and femaleness and whiteness and blackness and other than that “there is no god but He, the Exalted in Might” in His kingdom “the Wise” in His creation
It is He who has sent down to you the Book, in it are verses that are precise and clear in meaning, they are the foundation of the Book, its basis that is relied upon in rulings, and others that are ambiguous whose meanings are not understood, like the beginnings of the surahs. And He made it all precise in His statement, “He has made His verses precise,” meaning that there is no defect in it, and ambiguous in His statement, “a similar Book,” meaning that some of it resembles others in beauty and truth. As for those in whose hearts is deviation from the truth, they follow that which is ambiguous in it, seeking to seek temptation for their ignorance by falling into doubts and confusion and seeking its interpretation, its explanation. And none knows its interpretation, its explanation, except Allah alone. And the firm, steadfast, those firmly established in knowledge are the subject and predicate. They say, “We believe in it,” meaning in the ambiguous, that it is from Allah, and we do not know its meaning. Both the precise and the ambiguous are from our Lord. And what is mentioned by assimilating the ta’ in the original into the dhal means that only those of understanding, the people of reason, will be admonished, and they say Also if they see who is following him"
j-0107	“Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate” do not let them turn away from the truth by seeking an interpretation that is not befitting of us, as You have led the hearts of those people astray “after You have guided us” have directed us to it “and grant us from Yourself” from Yourself “mercy” as confirmation “for You are the Bestower” O “Our Lord, indeed You will gather the people” gather them “for a Day” that is, on a Day “about which there is no doubt” that is the Day of Resurrection, then You will reward them for their deeds as You promised “for Allah does not fail in His promise” His promise of resurrection in which there is a shift from the address, and it is possible that it is from the words of the Most High, and the purpose of supplicating with that is to show that their concern is the matter of the Hereafter, and for that reason they asked for steadfastness in guidance in order to attain its reward. The two sheikhs narrated on the authority of Aisha, may God be pleased with her, that she said: The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, recited this verse: “It is He who has sent down to you the Book; in it are verses that are precise” to the end of it, and he said: “So when you see those who follow that of it which is ambiguous, then those are the ones whom God has named, so beware of them.” At-Tabarani narrated in Al-Kabeer on the authority of Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari that he heard the Prophet May God bless him and grant him peace, he said: I fear for my nation only three things, and he mentioned among them that the Book will be opened to them and the believer will take it, seeking its interpretation, and none knows its interpretation except God, and those firmly rooted in knowledge will say: We believe in it, all is from our Lord, and none will remember except those of understanding. Hadith
j-0108	"""Indeed, those who disbelieve - neither their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah at all. And those are the fuel of the Fire"" with the opening of the waw, what is kindled with it. Their habit is ""like the habit"" of ""the people of Pharaoh and those before them"" of the nations such as Aad and Thamud. ""They denied Our signs, so Allah seized them"" your people ""for their sins."" The sentence explains what came before it. ""And Allah is severe in penalty."" It was revealed when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered the Jews to convert to Islam after his return from Badr. They said, ""Do not be deceived by the fact that you killed a group of Quraysh who were ignorant of fighting."" ""Say,"" O Muhammad, ""to those who disbelieved,"" of the Jews, ""You will be overcome"" with the ta' and the ya' in this world by killing, capturing, and imposing the jizya. This has happened. ""And you will be herded,"" with both faces in the Hereafter, ""to Hell,"" so you will enter it. ""And an evil resting place"" is the bed. ""There has already been for you a sign"" a lesson, and the verb is mentioned for separation ""in two companies"" two groups ""that met"" on the day of Badr for fighting. ""A company fighting."" In the way of God” meaning obeying Him, and they were the Prophet and his companions, and they were three hundred and thirteen men with them, horsemen, six cubits, and eight swords, and most of them were foot soldiers, “and another group of unbelievers who saw them” meaning the unbelievers “twice as many” meaning the Muslims, meaning more than them, and they were about a thousand “with the eye” meaning a clear, visible vision, and God gave them victory despite their small number, “and God supports” strengthens “with His victory whomever He wills” His victory, “there is certainly in that” mentioned “a lesson for those of vision” for those with insight, so will you not take heed of that and believe?"
j-0109	"""Beautified for people is the love of desires"" what the soul desires and calls for, Allah or Satan has made it beautiful ""of women and children and heaps"" of gold and silver and branded horses"" of beautiful ""and livestock"" that is, camels, cows and sheep ""and tillage"" the crops ""that"" mentioned ""is the enjoyment of worldly life"" that is enjoyed in it and then perishes ""and Allah has with Him the best destination"" the reference, which is Paradise, so it should be desired and not anything else ""Say"" O Muhammad to your people ""Shall I inform you"" I tell you ""of something better than that"" mentioned of desires, a question of confirmation ""for those who fear Allah"" polytheism ""with their Lord"" the predicate of its subject ""are gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein"" that is destined for eternity ""and purified spouses"" from menstruation and other things that are disgusting ""and approval"" with the first letter broken and the second letter closed are two languages, meaning abundant approval ""from Allah. And Allah is Seeing"" knowing ""of the servants"" so He rewards each of them By his work

“Those” is an adjective or substitute for those before it “who say” “O our Lord, indeed we have believed” we have believed in You and Your Messenger “so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the Fire”

“The patient” in obedience and from disobedience is an adjective “and the truthful” in faith “and the obedient” those who obey God “and the spenders” those who give charity “and those who seek forgiveness” from God by saying “O God, forgive us” “in the hours before dawn” the last part of the night was specifically mentioned because it is the time of heedlessness and the pleasure of sleep"
j-0110	"“Allah bears witness” He made clear to His creation with evidence and signs “that there is no god” that is, there is no true god in existence “except Him” and “the angels” testified to that with their acknowledgement “and those of knowledge” from the prophets and believers with their belief and wording “establishing” in managing His creations and its accusative case is in the state and the factor in it is the meaning of the sentence, that is, He is unique “in justice” with fairness “there is no god except Him” He repeated it for emphasis “the Almighty” in His kingdom “the Wise” in His creation

“Indeed, the religion” that is acceptable “in the sight of Allah” is “Islam” that is, the law with which the messengers were sent and is based on monotheism. In a reading with the opening of “an” instead of “anhu” etc., a substitute for inclusion. “And those who were given the Scripture” the Jews and Christians did not differ in religion except after knowledge had come to them, some of them monotheistic and some of them disbelieved “out of envy” from the disbelievers “among themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah” “then indeed, Allah is swift in taking account” that is, in punishing him

“So if they dispute with you” the disbelievers dispute with you, O Muhammad, about religion “then say” To them, “I have submitted my face to God,” I have submitted to Him, “and whoever follows me,” and He singled out the face for mention because of its honor, so others are more deserving. “And say to those who were given the Scripture,” the Jews and Christians, “and to the unlettered ones,” the polytheists of the Arabs, “Have you submitted?” That is, have you submitted? “If they have submitted, then they have been guided,” from misguidance, “but if they turn away,” from Islam, “then upon you is only the conveyance,” that is, the delivery of the message, “and God is Seeing of the servants,” so He will reward them for their deeds. This was before the command to fight."
j-0111	“Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah and kill” and in another reading, “the prophets without right and kill those who enjoin justice” with justice “among the people” and they are the Jews. It was narrated that they killed forty-three prophets, but one hundred and seventy of their servants forbade them, so they killed them that day. “Then give them tidings” inform them “of a painful punishment” painful. And mentioning the tidings is to mock them, and the “fa” entered into the news of “in” because of the resemblance of its relative pronoun with the condition. “Those are the ones whose deeds have become worthless” the good they did, such as charity and maintaining family ties, “in this world and the Hereafter” so they are not taken into account because of the lack of a condition. “And they will have no helpers” to prevent the punishment.
j-0112	“Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture?” The Torah. “They call” in the state of “to the Book of God to judge between them. Then a party of them turns away while they are averse.” It was revealed about the Jews. Two of them committed adultery, so they went to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and he ruled that they should be stoned. They became angry, so the Torah was brought and they found in it that they were stoned. “That” turning away and turning away “is because they said” that is, because of their saying “The Fire will not touch us except for a few days” forty days, the period during which their fathers worshipped the calf, then it will be removed from them. “And their deception in their religion” is related to his saying “what they used to invent” from their saying that. “Then how” their state “will be when We gather them for a Day” that is, a Day “about which there is no doubt” that is, the Day of Resurrection “and every soul” of the People of the Scripture and others “is fully compensated for what it has earned” of good and evil “and they” that is, the people “will not be wronged” by a reduction in a good deed or an increase in a bad deed.
j-0113	And it was revealed when the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, promised his nation the kingdom of Persia and Rome, but the hypocrites said, “It is impossible.” “Say, ‘O God, Owner of the Kingdom, You give the kingdom to whomever You will, and You take the kingdom away from whomever You will. You honor whomever You will, by giving it, and You abase whomever You will, by taking it away from him. “In Your hand is good, that is, and evil. Indeed, You are over all things competent.’” “You cause the night to enter the day, and You cause the day to enter the night, so that each increases what the other lacks. “And You bring forth the living from the dead, like the human being and the bird from the sperm and the egg, and You bring forth the dead, like the sperm and the egg, from the living, and You provide for whomever You will without account, that is, with abundant provision.”
j-0114	"""Believers should not take disbelievers as allies"" to befriend them ""instead of"" that is, other than ""believers. And whoever does that"" that is, befriends them ""then there is nothing"" in the religion ""of Allah except that you fear them with fear"" the source of taqiyyah, meaning that you fear fear, so you may befriend them with your tongue rather than your heart. This was before the glory of Islam and it applies to those who are in a country where there is no power. ""And Allah warns you"" frightens you ""of Himself"" that He will be angry with you if you befriend them. ""And to Allah is the final destination"" the reference, so He will reward you. ""Say"" to them ""Whether you conceal what is in your breasts"" your hearts of their befriending ""or reveal it"" you reveal it, ""Allah knows it, and"" He ""knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth. And Allah is over all things competent"" and from this is the punishment of those who befriend them. Remember ""On the Day when every soul will find present what it has done"" h ""of good and what it has done"" h ""of evil"" subject and predicate ""it will wish that between it and that was a great distance"" an end at the end of the distance that it cannot reach ""and Allah warns you of Himself"" repeated for emphasis ""And God is most kind to His servants."""
j-0115	And it was revealed when they said, “We worship idols only out of love for God, so that they may bring us closer to Him.” “Say,” to them, O Muhammad, “If you love God, then follow me, and God will love you,” meaning He will reward you, “and forgive you your sins. And God is Forgiving,” to those who follow me, what came before that, “and Merciful,” to them. “Say,” to them, “Obey God and the Messenger,” in what he commands you to do of monotheism, “but if they turn away,” turn away from obedience, “then indeed, God does not love the disbelievers,” in which the apparent replaces the implicit, meaning He does not love them, meaning that He will punish them.
j-0116	"""Allah chose"" chose ""Adam and Noah and the family of Abraham and the family of Imran"" meaning themselves ""above all the worlds"" He makes the prophets from their descendants
""offspring, some of them from"" the children of ""some"" of them ""and Allah is Hearing and Knowing""

Remember ""when the wife of Imran said"" Hannah when she grew old and longed for a child, so she called upon Allah and felt pregnant ""O my Lord, indeed I have vowed"" to make ""to You what is in my womb dedicated"" freed and free from the concerns of this world to serve Your Holy House ""so accept it from me, for You are the Hearing"" of the call ""the Knowing"" of intentions and Imran died while she was pregnant

So when she gave birth to her, she gave birth to a girl and she was hoping that it would be a boy since only boys were freed. She said apologetically, ""O my Lord, indeed I have given birth to a female"" and Allah knows best, meaning He knows what she gave birth to. An interjection from His words, and in a reading with a damma on the ta', the male she requested is not like the female she was given because it is intended for service and she is not suitable due to her weakness and nakedness and what afflicts her from menstruation and the like, and I have named her Mary And I seek refuge for her and her offspring, her children, from Satan, the outcast. In the hadith, there is no newborn who is born except that Satan touches him when he is born, so he cries out, except for Mary and her son. Narrated by the two sheikhs. “So her Lord accepted her” meaning, Mary was accepted by her mother “with good acceptance and made her grow in a good manner” He created her with good character, so she grew in one day as a newborn grows in a year. Her mother brought her to the rabbis, the guardians of the Holy House, and she said, “Here is this little girl for you.” They competed over her because she was the daughter of their leader. Zachariah said, “I have more right to her because her maternal aunt is with me.” They said, “Not until we draw lots.” So they set out, twenty-nine in number, to the Jordan River and cast their pens, on the condition that whoever’s pen stuck in the water and climbed up would have more right to her. Zachariah’s pen stuck, so he took her and built a room for her in the mosque with a ladder that no one else could climb up to. He would bring her food, drink, and oil, and he would find summer fruits in the winter and winter fruits in the summer, as God Almighty said. “And Zachariah was in charge of her.” He brought her to him, and in a reading with emphasis, and Zachariah is in the accusative case, extended. And the subject is Allah. “Whenever Zachariah entered upon her the sanctuary,” the room, which is the most honorable of gatherings, “he found with her provision. He said, ‘O Mary, from where did you get this?’ She said, while she was young, ‘It is from Allah,’ He brings it to me from Paradise. ‘Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account,’ ample provision without any consequence. ‘There,’ that is, when Zachariah saw that and knew that the One who is able to bring about something at an untimely time is able to bring about a child in old age, and his family had died out, ‘Zachariah called upon his Lord,’ when he entered the sanctuary to pray in the middle of the night, ‘He said, “My Lord, grant me from Yourself a good offspring,’ a righteous son. ‘Indeed, You are the Hearer, the Answerer of supplication.” ‘Then the angels called to him,’ that is, Gabriel, ‘while he was standing praying in the sanctuary,’ that is, the mosque, ‘that,’ that is, ‘that,’ and in a reading with a kasra, with the estimation of the saying, ‘Allah gives you good tidings,’ heavy and light, ‘of John, confirming a word, from Allah,’ that is, of Jesus, that he is the spirit of Allah, and he was called a word because he created. By the word “be” followed by “and a master” followed by “and chaste” forbidden from women “and a prophet from among the righteous” it was narrated that he did not commit a sin and did not intend to do so

“He said, “My Lord, how can I have a boy” a child “while old age has reached me” that is, she has reached the end of her life at one hundred and twenty years “and my wife is barren” she has reached ninety-eight years “He said” the matter “thus” from God creating a boy from you two “God does what He wills” nothing is beyond Him and to show this great power He inspired him to ask so that he would be answered with it and when his soul yearned for the speed of the one who was given glad tidings

“He said, “My Lord, make for me a sign” that is, a sign of my wife’s pregnancy “He said, “Your sign” is that you do not speak to people” that is, refrain from speaking to them, unlike the remembrance of God Almighty “for three days” that is, during their nights “except by gesture” allusion “and remember your Lord much and glorify” pray “in the evening and the morning” the end of the day and its beginning"
j-0117	“And” remember “when the angels” that is, Gabriel “said, ‘O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you’ He has chosen you “and purified you” from the touch of men “and has chosen you above the women of the worlds” that is, the people of your time “O Mary, be devout toward your Lord” obey Him “and prostrate yourself and bow with those who bow” that is, pray with those who pray. “That” mentioned about the matter of Zachariah and Mary “is from the news of the unseen” news of what is hidden from you “We reveal it to you” O Muhammad “and you were not with them when they cast their pens” into the water to cast lots “which of them should be responsible” to raise “Mary” nor were you with them when they singled out” in her responsibility, so you knew that and informed about it. You only knew it through the revelation.
j-0118	Remember, “When the angels said,” that is, Gabriel, “O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a word from Him,” that is, a son, “whose name is the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary,” addressing her by attributing him to her, indicating that she would give birth to him without a father, since it is the custom of men to attribute him to their fathers, “of high standing,” with prestige, “in this world,” with prophethood, “and in the Hereafter,” with intercession and high ranks, “and of those brought near,” to Allah, “and he will speak to the people in the cradle,” that is, as a child before the time of speaking, “and in maturity, and of the righteous.” “She said, ‘My Lord, how can I have a son when no man has touched me?’ He said, “Thus,” who created a child from you without a father, “Allah creates what He wills. When He decrees a matter,” He wants to create it, “He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is,” that is, he is. “And We will teach him,” with the letter “nun” and the letter “the scripture,” “and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel,” “and” He will make him “a messenger to the Children of Israel,” in childhood or after puberty. So Gabriel blew into the pocket of her garment, and she became pregnant, and what happened to her was what happened. It is mentioned in Surah Maryam: When God sent him to the Children of Israel, he said to them: “Indeed, I am the Messenger of God to you.” “Indeed, I have come to you with a sign” as a sign of my truthfulness “from your Lord” which is: “I” and in another reading with a kasra as a resumption “create” I form “for you from clay like the figure of a bird” like his image, so the kaf is a passive participle “and I breathe into it” the pronoun is for the kaf “and it becomes a bird” and in another reading a bird “by God’s permission” by His will, so He created for them the bat because He perfected the bird in creation, so it would fly while they watched it, and when it disappeared from their sight, it would fall dead “and I heal” I cure “the blind” who was born blind “and the leper” and he was specifically mentioned because they were infirm, and he sent him in the time of medicine, so he healed fifty thousand in one day by supplication on the condition of faith “and I bring the dead to life by God’s permission” he repeated it to negate the illusion of divinity in him, so he revived Azar, a friend of his, and the son of the old woman and the daughter of the tenth, so they lived and they had a son, Sam, son of Noah, who died immediately “and I inform you of what you eat and what you eat.” You store up” you hide “in your houses” of what I did not suffer, so he would tell the person what he ate and what he ate and what he ate after “Indeed in that” the mentioned “is a sign for you if you are believers” “And” I came to you “confirming what came before me” before me “of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you” in it, so he made lawful for them from fish and birds what had no right to it. It was said that he made all of it lawful, so some means all “And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord” he repeated it to emphasize and to build on it “So fear God and obey” in what I command you to do, monotheism of God and obedience to Him “Indeed God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This” what I command you “is a straight path” but they denied him and did not believe in him
j-0119	“And when Jesus perceived” he knew “their disbelief” and that they wanted to kill him “he said: Who are my helpers” my helpers going “to Allah” to support His religion “the disciples said: We are the helpers of Allah” the helpers of His religion and they are the chosen ones of Jesus, the first to believe in him and they were twelve men of the houris which is pure whiteness and it was said that they were short men who whitened the clothes “We believe” we believe “in Allah and bear witness” O Jesus “that we are Muslims” “Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed” of the Gospel “and we have followed the Messenger” Jesus “so register us among the witnesses” for You of the Oneness and for Your Messenger of the truthfulness
j-0120	God Almighty said: “And they plotted,” that is, the disbelievers of the Children of Israel, against Jesus, when they assigned someone to kill him by treachery. “And God plotted,” by casting the likeness of Jesus on those who intended to kill him, so they killed him and raised Jesus to heaven. “And God is the best of plotters,” He knows best about him. Remember, “when God said, ‘O Jesus, indeed I will take you,’ and raise you to Me,” from this world without death, “and purify you,” and remove you, “from those who disbelieve, and make those who follow you,’ those who believed in your prophethood from among the Muslims and Christians, “superior to those who disbelieve,” in you, and they are the Jews, who will prevail over them with argument and the sword, “until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that over which you used to differ,” of religious matters. “As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe punishment in this world,” by killing, captivity, and the jizya, “and in the Hereafter,” with the Fire, “and they will have no helpers,” to prevent Him. As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, He will pay them their wages in full, with the word “ya” and “nun,” meaning He will punish them. It was narrated that God Almighty sent a cloud to him, which lifted him up and he clung to it. His mother cried and he said to her that the Resurrection will gather us. That was on the Night of Decree in Jerusalem and he was thirty-three years old and his mother lived six years after him. The two sheikhs narrated a hadith that he will descend near the Hour and rule according to the law of our Prophet and kill the Antichrist and the pig and break the cross and abolish the jizya. In a hadith of Muslim it says that he will remain for seven years. In a hadith of Abu Dawud al-Tayalisi it says that he will remain for forty years and he will die and the funeral prayer will be performed over him. It is possible that what is meant is the sum of his stay on earth before and after the ascension. “That” mentioned about the matter of Jesus “We recite it” we narrated it “to you” O Muhammad “of the verses” is a state of the “ha” in “We recite it” and its factor is what is in that of the meaning of indication “and the wise remembrance” the decisive, meaning the Qur’an.
j-0121	"“The likeness of Jesus” his strange affair “in the sight of God is as the likeness of Adam” as his affair in his creation without a father, and this is from likening the strange to the strange so that it is more decisive for the opponent and more effective in the soul “He created him” that is Adam, that is, molded him “from dust, then said to him, ‘Be’” a human being “and he was” that is, so he was. And likewise Jesus said to him, “Be” without a father, so he was

“The truth is from your Lord” the predicate of a deleted subject, that is, the matter of Jesus “so be not of the doubters” the doubters

“So whoever disputes with you” argues with you from the Christians “about him after what has come to you of knowledge” about his matter “say” to them “Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves” so we gather them “then let us supplicate” we implore in supplication “and invoke the curse of God upon the liars” by saying, “O God, curse the liar” about the matter of Jesus. And the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, invited the delegation of Najran for that when they disputed with him about him and they said until we look into our matter and then we come to you.” So the one with their opinion said, “You have recognized his prophethood and that he is not worthy of it.” No nation has ever accepted a prophet except that they perished. So they bade farewell to the man and departed. They came to the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, and al-Hasan, al-Husayn, Fatima, and Ali had gone out with him. He said to them, “If you call, then say ‘Amen.’” But they refused to curse and made peace with him on the basis of the jizya. Narrated by Abu Na’im. On the authority of Ibn Abbas, he said, “If those who were to perform the Mubahala had gone out, they would have returned without finding money or family.” It was narrated that if they had gone out, they would have been burned."
j-0122	"«This» mentioned «is the true story» the news «of which there is no doubt. «And there is no» redundant «god except Allah. And indeed, Allah is the Exalted in Might» in His kingdom «the Wise» in His creation. «But if they turn away» turn away from faith «then indeed, Allah is Knowing of the corrupters» so He will punish them. In this, the apparent is placed in place of the implicit. «Say, O People of the Scripture» the Jews and Christians «Come to a word that is equitable between us and you» it is «that» an «we worship none but Allah and associate nothing with Him and let not some of us take as lords besides Allah» as you took the rabbis and monks. «But if they turn away» turn away from monotheism «then say» you to them «bear witness that we are Muslims» monotheists.» And it was revealed when the Jews said, Abraham is a Jew and we are of his religion and the Christians said likewise «O People of the Scripture, why do you argue» quarrel «about Abraham» on the basis of your claim that he is of your religion «and the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him» a long time after its revelation. And after its revelation, Judaism occurred Christianity “Do you not understand?” The invalidity of your statement

“Ha” is for emphasis “you” is the subject “these” and the predicate “you have argued about that of which you have knowledge” of the matter of Moses and Jesus and your claim that you are on their religion “so why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge” of the matter of Abraham “while Allah knows” his matter “and you do not know” God Almighty said to exonerate Abraham

“Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth” turning away from all religions to the upright religion “a Muslim” a monotheist “and he was not of the polytheists”

“Indeed, the people who are most deserving” of Abraham “are those who followed him” in his time “and this Prophet” Muhammad because he agreed with him in most of his law “and those who believe” of his nation, so they are the ones who should say we are on his religion, not you “and Allah is the ally of the believers” their supporter and protector"
j-0123	And it was revealed when the Jews called Muadh, Hudhayfah and Ammar to their religion: “A party of the People of the Scripture wish they could mislead you, but they mislead none but themselves,” because the sin of misleading them is upon them and the believers do not obey them in this. “And they perceive not” that. “O People of the Scripture, why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah” the Qur’an, which contains the description of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “while you bear witness” you know that it is the truth. “O People of the Scripture, why do you mix” you mix “truth with falsehood” with distortion and forgery “and conceal the truth” that is, the description of the Prophet “while you know” that it is the truth. “And a party of the People of the Scripture” the Jews said to each other, “Believe in that which has been revealed to those who believe” that is, the Qur’an “at the beginning of the day” its beginning “and disbelieve” in it “at its end that perhaps” that is, the believers “they will return” from their religion, since they say that these people did not return from it after entering it and they are people of knowledge except because of their knowledge of its falsehood. They also said, “And do not believe” they believe “except for one who follows” he agreed. “Your religion,” the Almighty said, “Say,” to them, O Muhammad, “Indeed, guidance is the guidance of Allah,” which is Islam, and anything other than it is misguidance. The sentence is an interjection. “That,” that is, that “anyone is given the like of what you have been given,” of the Book, wisdom, and factions. “That” is the object of “believe,” and the exception from it, “that one” is preceded by the exception, meaning do not acknowledge that anyone is given that except for the one who follows your religion. “Or” that “they argue with you,” that is, the believers defeat you, “before your Lord,” on the Day of Resurrection, because you are more sound in religion. In the reading, “that” with the hamza of rebuke, meaning that you acknowledge that anyone is given the like of it. The Almighty said, “Say, ‘Indeed, bounty is in Allah’s hand. He gives it to whom He wills.’” So how do you know that no one is given the like of what you have been given? “And Allah is Bountiful,” abundant in bounty, “Knowing,” of who is worthy of it. “He singles out for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.”
j-0124	“And among the People of the Scripture is he who, if you entrust him with a great amount of money, will return it to you,” for his trustworthiness, like Abdullah ibn Salam, to whom a man entrusted one thousand two hundred ounces of gold, and he returned it to him. “And among them is he who, if you entrust him with a dinar, will not return it to you,” for his betrayal, “except as long as you stand over him,” not leaving him, and when you leave him, he will deny it. Like Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf, a Qurayshite entrusted him with a dinar, and he denied it. “That,” that is, he did not return it, “is because they said,” because of their saying, “There is no sin upon us concerning the unlettered,” that is, the Arabs, “for us to do,” that is, to wrong those who oppose their religion and attribute it to God Almighty. God Almighty said, “And they tell lies about God,” in attributing that to Him, “while they know,” that they are lying. “Yes,” there is a way for them, “whoever fulfills his covenant,” that which he has made with God, or God’s covenant with him, regarding fulfilling the trust and other things, “and fears God,” by abandoning sins and performing acts of obedience, “for indeed, God loves the righteous.” In this, the apparent is placed in place of the implicit, meaning that He loves them. Meaning: He will reward them. It was revealed about the Jews when they changed the description of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and God’s covenant with them in the Torah, and about those who swore falsely in a claim or in the sale of goods. “Indeed, those who purchase” they exchange “God’s covenant” to them in belief in the Prophet and fulfilling the trust “and their oaths” their false oaths by God Almighty “for a small price” of this world. “They will have no portion” no share “in the Hereafter, and God will not speak to them” in anger with them “nor look at them” have mercy on them “on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them” purify them “and they will have a painful punishment” painful.
j-0125	“And indeed, among them” meaning the People of the Book “is a party” such as Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf “who distort their tongues with the Book” meaning they bend it in their recitation from the revealed to what they distorted of the description of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and the like “so that you may think it” meaning the distorted “is from the Book” that God revealed “and it is not from the Book and they say, “It is from God” but it is not from God and they tell a lie about God while they know” that they are lying. It was revealed when the Christians of Najran said that Jesus had commanded them to take him as a lord and when some of the Muslims asked to prostrate to him, may God bless him and grant him peace. “It is not” befitting “for a human being that God should give him the Book and the wisdom” meaning the understanding of the Shari’ah “and the prophethood and then he should say to the people, ‘Be servants to me instead of God.’ Rather” he says, “Be rabbis” scholars who work and are attributed to the Lord by adding an alif and a nun for emphasis “because of what you used to know” with a light and heavy “the Book and what you used to study” meaning because of that, its benefit is that you work. “And He does not command you” with the nominative as a resumption, meaning God and the accusative as an apposition. He says, “That you should take the angels and the prophets as lords,” just as the Sabians took the angels, the Jews took Ezra, and the Christians took Jesus. “Does he command you to disbelieve after you were Muslims?” This is not appropriate for him.
j-0126	“And” remember “when” when “Allah took the covenant of the prophets” their pledge “for” with the opening of the lam for the beginning and to emphasize the meaning of the oath in taking the covenant and its breaking is related to taking and what is connected in both ways, meaning for what “I gave you” it and in the reading “we gave you” “of the Book and wisdom and then there came to you a Messenger confirming what is with you” of the Book and wisdom, and he is Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace “that you must believe in him and support him” the answer to the oath if you reach him and their nations follow them in that “He said” the Most High to them “Have you acknowledged” that “and taken” accepted “upon that My covenant” they said “we have acknowledged” He said “then bear witness” against yourselves and your followers to that “and I am with you among the witnesses” against you and them “But whoever turns away” turns away “after that” the covenant “then those are the wicked” “Do they seek other than the religion of Allah” with the ya and the ta’ meaning the ones who turn away “and to Him has submitted” salvation “whoever is in the heavens and the earth willingly” without refusal “And they will be forced” with the sword by seeing what he resorts to, “and to it they will return” with the ta’, ya’ and hamza at the beginning of the verse for denial.
j-0127	“Say” to them, O Muhammad, “We believe in God and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes” his sons “and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them” in belief or denial “and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him” sincere in worship. It was revealed about those who apostatized and joined the infidels. “And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers” because he will be destined for eternal Hellfire.
j-0128	"""How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and bore witness"" that is, their testimony ""that the Messenger is true"" and ""clear proofs"" have come to them"", the apparent arguments for the truthfulness of the Prophet ""and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people"" that is, the disbelievers ""their recompense is that upon them is the curse of Allah and the angels and the people all together"" ""abiding therein"" that is, the curse or the fire indicated by it ""the punishment will not be lightened for them nor will they be reprieved"" ""except for those who repent after that and amend"" their actions ""for then Allah is Forgiving"" to them ""and Merciful"" to them

And it was revealed about the Jews ""Indeed, those who disbelieved"" in Jesus ""after their belief"" in Moses ""and then increased in disbelief"" in Muhammad ""never will their repentance be accepted"" if they gurgle or die as disbelievers ""and those are the ones who are astray"" ""Indeed, those who disbelieved and died as disbelievers - never will be accepted from one of them the earth full of gold"" the amount that fills it, even if he were to ransom himself with it"" the letter fa was inserted in the predicate of ""in"" For the sake of resemblance to the condition and indicating the cause of non-acceptance of death for disbelief, “For them is a painful punishment,” painful, “and they will have no helpers,” to prevent it."
j-0129	“You will not attain righteousness” that is, its reward, which is Paradise “until you spend” give charity “of that which you love” of your wealth “and whatever you spend, indeed, Allah is Knowing of it” so He will reward for it. And it was revealed when the Jews said, “You claim that you are following the religion of Abraham” and he did not eat camel meat or milk “all food was lawful” permissible “for the Children of Israel except what Israel” Jacob “forbade himself” that is, camels when he had sciatica with the fat-ha and the qasr, so he vowed that if he recovered he would not eat them, so it was forbidden to him “before the Torah was revealed” that was after Abraham and it was not forbidden during his time as they claimed “say” to them “then bring the Torah and recite it” so that the truth of what you say would become clear “if you are truthful” about it, but they were dumbfounded and did not bring it. God Almighty said “whoever invents a lie against Allah after that” that is, the emergence of the proof that the prohibition was only on the part of Jacob and not during the time of Abraham “then it is those who are the wrongdoers” who transgress the truth towards falsehood
j-0130	«Say, Allah has spoken the truth» in this as in all that He has informed us «So follow the religion of Abraham» which I am «Upright» inclining from every religion to Islam «And he was not of the polytheists» with it. And it was revealed when they said, “Our qiblah is before your qiblah, the first House established for people to worship on earth is the one in Bakkah with the letter ba’, a dialect in Mecca, it was named that because it crushes the necks of the tyrants, that is, it crushes them. It was built by the angels before the creation of Adam, and after it was established the Aqsa Mosque, and between them there were forty years, as in the hadith of the two Sahihs, and in the hadith that the first thing to appear on the surface of the water when the heavens and the earth were created was a white foam, so the earth spread out from beneath it, blessed, a state of which, that is, of blessing and guidance for the worlds, because it is their qiblah. «In it are clear signs» among them «the station of Abraham» that is, the stone on which he stood when building the house, so the trace of his feet is in it and it has remained until now despite the passage of time and the exchange of hands on it, and among them is the doubling of good deeds in it and that birds do not climb it «And whoever enters it is safe» not exposed to it by killing or injustice or anything else «And Hajj to the House is a duty owed to Allah by the people» with the letter ha’ broken or open Two languages ​​in the source of Hajj meaning intended and it is replaced by “whoever is able to find a way to it” roads. He interpreted it as provisions and a mount. It was narrated by Al-Hakim and others. “And whoever disbelieves” in God or in what He has imposed of Hajj “then indeed, God is independent of the worlds” mankind, the jinn, the angels, and their worship.

""Say, O People of the Scripture, why do you turn away from the way of Allah those who believe, seeking it crookedly while you are witnesses, knowing that the acceptable and upright religion is the religion of Islam as in your book?

""It was revealed when some Jews passed by the Aws and Khazraj and their friendship angered them, so they reminded them of the tribulations that had occurred between them in the days of ignorance, so they quarrelled and almost fought.

j-0136	"“And” remember, O Muhammad, “when you went forth from your family” from Medina “to set” you alight “for the believers in stations” positions where they stand “for the battle. And God is Hearing” of your words “and Knowing” of your conditions. It was the day of Uhud. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, went out with a thousand or less than fifty men and the polytheists were three thousand and he camped in the ravine on Saturday, the seventh of Shawwal in the year three of the Hijra. He turned his back and his army to Uhud and straightened their ranks and seated an army of archers and put Abdullah ibn Jubayr over them at the foot of the mountain and said: “Sprinkle arrows on us, do not come to us from behind and do not move, whether we are defeated or victorious.” “When” is a substitute for “when” before it, “two parties from among you” Banu Salamah and Banu Haritha, the wings of the army “are about to lose heart” to fight and turn back. When Abdullah ibn Ubay, the hypocrite and his companions, turned back and said: “Why should we kill ourselves and our children?” And he said to Abu Jabir al-Sami, who said to him: “I ask you by God regarding your Prophet and yourselves, if we knew there would be fighting, we would follow you.” So he made them steadfast. Allah and they did not turn away. “And Allah is their Guardian,” their Helper. “And upon Allah let the believers put their trust,” to trust in Him alone.

And it was revealed when they were defeated, to remind them of Allah’s favor. “And Allah had already given you victory at Badr,” a place between Mecca and Medina, “while you were weak,” due to the small number and weapons. “So fear Allah that you may be grateful,” for His favors.

“When,” a circumstance for your victory, “you said to the believers,” threatening them to reassure them, “Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you,” help you, “with three thousand angels sent down,” with the emphasis and the emphasis.

“Yes,” that is sufficient for you. In Al-Anfal, with a thousand, because He first reinforced them with them, then it became three, then it became five, as Allah the Most High said, “If you are patient,” in meeting the enemy, “and fear” Allah in opposition, “and they come to you,” that is, the polytheists, “all at once,” their time, “your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels marked,” with the letter waw broken or open, meaning marked. And they were patient, and Allah fulfilled His promise by fighting with them. Angels on piebald horses wearing yellow or white turbans, sent between their shoulders. ""And Allah has not made it"" meaning the reinforcement ""except as good tidings for you"" of victory ""and that your hearts may be reassured"" so that they may not be alarmed by the large number of the enemy and your small number. ""And victory is only from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise"" He gives it to whomever He wills, and it is not by the large number of soldiers. ""To cut off"" related to ""yaseerkum"" meaning to destroy ""a portion of those who disbelieve"" by killing or capturing ""or to subdue them"" humiliate them by defeat ""so that they may return"" return ""disappointed"" not having achieved what they sought. It was revealed when the Prophet's front tooth was broken and his face was wounded on the day of Uhud, and he said, ""How can a people succeed who have stained the face of their Prophet with blood? You have no part in the matter, rather the matter is Allah's, so be patient"" or in the sense until He accepts their repentance with Islam or punishes them, for they are wrongdoers by disbelief. ""And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth"" as kings, creation, and servants.

j-0138	«And hasten» with waw and without it «to forgiveness from your Lord and a garden as wide as the heavens and the earth» that is, as wide as they were if one of them were to be connected to the other, and width is spaciousness «prepared for the righteous» God through doing acts of obedience and abandoning sins «who spend» in obedience to God «in prosperity and adversity» ease and hardship «and restrain anger» those who refrain from carrying it out despite their ability «and pardon the people» those whom they wronged, that is, those who refrain from punishing them «and God loves the doers of good» through these actions, that is, He rewards them «and those who, when they have committed an immorality» a heinous sin like adultery «or wronged themselves» without it, like the qiblah «remember God» that is, His threat «and seek forgiveness for their sins – and who» that is, no one «forgives sins except God? And they do not persist» persist «in what they have done» rather they desist from it «while they know» that what they have done is a sin «their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow. Beneath it are rivers, wherein they will abide eternally. This is a predicate, meaning they will abide eternally in it if they enter it. “And excellent is the reward of the workers.” This is the reward of those who work in obedience.
j-0139	"And it was revealed in the defeat of Uhud: “There have already passed away before you” ways of the disbelievers by giving them respite and then seizing them. “So travel” O believers “throughout the land and see how was the end of those who denied” the messengers, that is, the end of their affair of destruction. So do not grieve over their defeat, for We have given them respite for their time. “This” the Qur’an “is a clarification for mankind” all of them “and guidance” from misguidance “and an admonition for the righteous” among them. “And do not weaken” weaken from fighting the disbelievers “and do not grieve” over what befell you at Uhud “while you are the superior” by defeating them “if you are believers” truly. And its answer is indicated by the sum of what preceded it. “If a wound should touch you” afflict you at Uhud “with a wound” with the opening of the qaf and its closing, an effort from a wound and the like, “there has already touched the people” the disbelievers “with a wound similar to it” at Badr. “And those days We alternate” We spend them “among the people” one day for one group and one day for another “so that Allah may know” the knowledge of the appearance “Those who believe” are sincere in their faith from others “and He takes from among you martyrs” He honors them with martyrdom “and Allah does not love the wrongdoers” the disbelievers, that is, He punishes them and what He bestows upon them is a lure

“And that Allah may purify those who believe” purify them from sins by what befalls them “and destroy” the disbelievers

“Or” rather “did you think that you would enter Paradise while” Allah did not “know those among you who strive” knowledge of the appearance “and know the patient” in hardships

“And you were certainly wishing” in it one of the two ta’s was deleted in the original “for death before you met it” when you said, “If only we had a day like the day of Badr so that we might attain what its martyrs attained” “But you have seen it” that is, its cause was war “and you were looking on” that is, with insight, contemplating the situation as it was, so why were you defeated? And it was revealed about their defeat when it was rumored that the Prophet had been killed and the hypocrites said to them, “If he has been killed, then return to your religion”

“And Muhammad is only a messenger; messengers have passed away before him. So if he dies Or if he is killed, like others, “you have turned back on your heels,” you have returned to disbelief, and the last sentence is the subject of a rhetorical question, meaning that what was worshipped, so you have turned back. “And whoever turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all,” but he will only harm himself. “And Allah will reward the grateful,” His blessings with steadfastness."
j-0140	“And no soul can die except by Allah’s permission” by His decree “a decree” a source, meaning Allah has decreed that “deferred” temporarily, neither advanced nor delayed. So why were you defeated, when defeat does not prevent death, and steadfastness does not cut short life. “And whoever desires” by his deeds “the reward of this world” meaning his recompense from it “We will give him thereof” what is allotted to him and he has no share in the Hereafter. “And whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him thereof” meaning from its reward. “And We will reward the grateful.” “And how many” how many “prophet fought” and in the reading “killed” and the subject is his pronoun “with him” the predicate of its subject “many devout” large crowds. “But they did not weaken” did not cowardly “for what befell them in the cause of Allah” of wounds and the killing of their prophets and companions. “Nor did they weaken” from jihad “nor did they submit” did they submit to their enemy as you did when before the killing of the Prophet. “And Allah loves the patient” in the face of affliction, meaning He will reward them. “And their only statement” when their Prophet was killed despite their steadfastness and patience “was that they said, ‘Our Lord, forgive us.’” Our sins and our excesses” we exceeded the limit “in our affair” indicating that what happened to them was due to their bad deeds and their humiliation “and made our feet firm” with the strength to fight “and gave us victory over the disbelieving people” “so God gave them the reward of this world” victory and spoils “and the best reward of the Hereafter” meaning Paradise, the favor beyond what they deserved “and God loves the doers of good”
j-0141	“O you who have believed, if you obey those who disbelieve” in what they command you, “they will turn you back on your heels” to disbelief, “and you will become losers.” “Rather, Allah is your Protector,” your Helper, “and He is the best of helpers,” so obey Him rather than them. “We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve,” with the sukoon on the ‘ayn and the damma on the ‘ayn, fear. They resolved after their departure from Uhud to return and exterminate the Muslims, so they were terrified and did not return, “because they associated” because of their association “with Allah that for which He had not sent down any authority,” an argument for its worship, namely idols, “and their refuge is the Fire, and wretched is the residence,” the refuge, “of the wrongdoers,” the disbelievers.
j-0142	"“And Allah fulfilled His promise to you” to you with victory “when you were killing them” by His permission” by His will “until you lost heart” you were afraid to fight “and disputed” you differed “about the matter” that is, the Prophet’s command to stand at the foot of the mountain to shoot, so some of you said we will go, our companions have been helped and some of you we will not disobey the Prophet’s command “and you disobeyed” his command and left the position to seek spoils “after He had shown you” God “what you love” of victory and the answer to “if” indicated by what preceded it, that is, He prevented you from His victory “among you is he who desires this world” so he left the position for the spoils “and among you is he who desires the Hereafter” so he remained steadfast in it until he was killed like Abdullah ibn Jubayr and his companions “then He turned you away” in apposition to the answer to “if” which is estimated to be your return to defeat “from them” that is, the disbelievers “that He might test you” so that He might grant you a favor and show the sincere from the infidels “and He has pardoned you” what you committed “and Allah is full of bounty to the believers” by pardoning. Remember “when” You ascend” you flee far in the land “and you do not turn back” you do not turn “to anyone, and the Messenger calls you in your rear” that is, from behind you, saying to the servants of God “and He rewarded you” so He recompensed you “with grief” of defeat “with grief” because of your grief for the Messenger for disobeying him. It was said that the ba’ means upon, that is, doubled upon the grief of missing the spoils “so that you would not” related to pardon or to reward you, so la is redundant “be sad over what has escaped you” of the spoils “nor what has befallen you” of killing and defeat “and God is Acquainted with what you do.” “Then He sent down upon you, after the grief, security” security “a drowsiness” instead of “overwhelming” with the ya’ and the ta’ “a party of you” and they are the believers so they were swaying under the shields and their swords were falling from them “and a party whose souls were concerned” that is, they were driven to worry and they had no desire except their salvation without the Prophet and his companions, so they did not sleep and they are the hypocrites “thinking about God” a thought “other than” the thought “the truth” that is, like the thought “The days of ignorance” when they believed that the Prophet was killed or was not victorious “they say, ‘Is there any part of the matter for us?’” meaning the victory that we were promised “say, ‘Indeed, the whole matter is for Allah’” in the accusative case for emphasis and the nominative case is the subject and predicate “for Allah’” meaning the decree is His to do as He wills “they conceal in themselves what they do not reveal” they reveal “to you they say” an explanation of what came before “if we had any part of the matter we would not have been killed here” meaning if the test was up to us we would not have gone out and not been killed but we were forced out “say,’” to them, “if you had been in your houses” and among you were those upon whom Allah had decreed death “those upon whom death had been decreed would have come forth” went out “to their places of death” their places of death and they would be killed and their sitting would not have saved them because His decree, the Most High, would inevitably happen “and” He did what He did by taking “that Allah might test” tests “what is in your breasts” your hearts of sincerity and hypocrisy “and purify” distinguish “what is in your hearts and Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts” what is in the hearts nothing is hidden from Him but rather He tests them to show people

“Indeed, those of you who turned back” from fighting “on the day the two armies met” the group of Muslims and the group of disbelievers at Uhud, and they were the Muslims except for twelve men, “they were only made to slip” made to slip “by Satan” by his whispering “because of some of what they had earned” of sins, which was disobeying the command of the Prophet, “but Allah has pardoned them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving” of the believers, “Forbearing” does not hasten punishment of the disobedient."
j-0143	“O you who believe, be not like those who disbelieved” that is, the hypocrites “and said of their brothers” that is, concerning them “when they set out” traveled “throughout the land” and died “or were engaged in war” the plural of “warrior” and were killed “if they had been with us they would not have died nor were they killed” that is, do not say as they said “that Allah may make that” the statement regarding the outcome of their affair “a regret in their hearts. And Allah gives life and causes death” so death is not prevented by sitting. “And Allah, of what you do” with the ta’ and the ya’ “is Seeing” so He will reward you for it. “And if” the lam of an oath “you are killed in the way of Allah” that is, jihad “or die” with the damma and kasra of the meem from matā yamūtu, that is, death comes to you in it “there is forgiveness” coming “from Allah” for your sins “and mercy” from Him to you for that. The lam and what it contains is the answer to the oath and it is in the subject of the verb as the subject of its predicate “better than what you accumulate” of the world with the ta’ and the ya’. “And if” the lam of an oath “you die” in both ways “or are killed” in Jihad and other things “to God” and not to anyone else “you will be gathered” in the Hereafter, and He will reward you.
j-0144	«So by mercy from Allah, you were gentle» O Muhammad «with them» that is, you were easy-going in your manners when they opposed you «and if you were rude» of bad character «hard-hearted» harsh and you were harsh with them «they would not have dispersed» dispersed «from around you. So pardon» overlook «their sins so that I may forgive them «and consult them» extract their opinions «in the matter» that is, your affair in war and jealousy to please their hearts, and you are not with you. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, consulted them often, so if you decide to carry out what you want after consultation «then rely upon Allah» trust in Him, not in consultation «for Allah loves those who rely» upon Him «if Allah helps you» helps you against your enemy as on the day of Badr «none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you» abandons your support as on the day of Uhud «who is there that can help you after Him» that is, after His forsake, that is, you have no supporter «and in Allah» and no one else «let the believers rely» so that they may trust
j-0145	And it was revealed when a red velvet was lost on the day of Uhud, so some people said, perhaps the Prophet took it. “And it is not befitting for a prophet to take spoils of war” to betray in the spoils, so do not think that of him. In a reading with the passive voice, it is attributed to the taking of spoils of war. “And whoever takes spoils of war will bring what he took on the Day of Resurrection” carrying it on his neck. “Then every soul will be compensated” the one who took spoils of war and others “for what it earned” what it did “and they will not be wronged” at all. “Is he who follows the pleasure of Allah” and obeys and does not take spoils of war “like he who incurs” returns “with wrath from Allah” for his disobedience and taking spoils of war “and his refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination” the reference is it. “They are of degrees” that is, people of degrees “with Allah” that is, of different statuses. So he who follows His pleasure will be rewarded, and he who incurs His wrath will be punished. “And Allah is Seeing of what they do” He will reward them for it.
j-0146	"“Allah has conferred a great favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves,” that is, an Arab like them so that they would understand him and be honored by him, not a king or a foreigner, “reciting to them His verses,” the Qur’an, “and purifying them,” purifying them from sins, “and teaching them the Book,” the Qur’an, “and wisdom,” the Sunnah, “although” lightened, that is, they “were before,” that is, before his sending, “in manifest error,” between

“And when a disaster struck you,” at Uhud, when seventy of you were killed, “and you had inflicted twice as much,” at Badr, when seventy were killed and seventy of them were taken prisoner, “you said,” in astonishment, “how,” from where did we get “this,” the abandonment when we are Muslims and the Messenger of Allah is among us? The last sentence is a place for rhetorical questioning. “Say,” to them, “It is from yourselves,” because you abandoned the center and were abandoned. “Indeed, Allah is over all things competent,” and from Him alone is victory, and He has rewarded you for your dissent."
j-0147	"“And what befell you on the day the two armies met” at Uhud “was by permission of Allah” by His will “and that He might make known” the knowledge of the appearance of “the believers” truly

“and that He might make known those who were hypocrites and” those “who were told” when they turned away from the fighting, and they were Abdullah bin Ubayy and his companions “Come, fight in the way of Allah” His enemies “or repel” the people from us by increasing your numbers if you did not fight “they said, ‘If we had known’ we knew how to fight, we would have followed you’” God Almighty said, denying them “they were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith” because of what they showed of their abandonment of the believers and before that they were nearer to faith in terms of appearance “they say with their mouths what is not in their hearts” and if they had known how to fight they would not have followed you “and Allah knows best what they conceal” of hypocrisy “those” a substitute for those before it or an attribute “who said to their brothers” in religion “and” they had “sincerely sat” from jihad “if they had obeyed us” meaning the martyrs of Uhud or our brothers in sitting “they would not have been killed. Say” to them “then repel” “Avoid death from yourselves, if you are truthful,” in that sitting saves from it, and it was revealed about the martyrs."
j-0148	“And never think that those who are killed” with the emphasis and the emphasis “in the cause of Allah” that is, for the sake of His religion “are dead. Rather” they are “alive with their Lord” their souls are in the crops of green birds that roam in Paradise wherever they wish, as mentioned in the hadith. “They are provided for” they eat from the fruits of Paradise. “Rejoicing” is a state of the pronoun “they are provided for” “in what Allah has given them of His bounty.” And “they” “rejoice” rejoice “for those who have not yet joined them from behind them” of their believing brothers. And “those” is replaced by “a” with “n” that is, that “there is no fear for them” that is, those who have not yet joined them “nor do they grieve” in the Hereafter, meaning they rejoice in their security and joy. “Rejoice in a blessing” a reward “from Allah and a bounty” an addition to it. “And that” with the fat-ha in apposition to blessing and with the kasra as a resumption “Allah does not allow the reward of the believers to be lost” rather He rewards them. “Those” is a subject “who responded to Allah and the Messenger” his call for them to go out to fight when Abu Sufyan and his companions wanted to return. They made an appointment with the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, at the Badr market the following year on the day of Uhud “after the wounds had afflicted them” by Uhud, and the predicate of the subject “for those among them who did good” by obeying him “and feared” by disobeying him “is a great reward” which is Paradise. “Those” is a substitute for those before it or an adjective. “The people said to them” that is, Nu’aym ibn Mas’ud al-Ashja’i “the people” Abu Sufyan and his companions “have gathered against you” the crowds to eradicate you “so fear them” and do not come to them “but it increased them” that statement “in faith” belief in God and certainty “and they said, ‘God is sufficient for us’” We have taken care of their matter “and He is the best Disposer of affairs’” He is the one to whom the matter is entrusted. They went out with the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and they arrived at the Badr market, and God cast terror into the hearts of Abu Sufyan and his companions, so they did not come, and they had merchandise with them, so they sold and made a profit. God Almighty said. “So they returned” they returned from Badr “with favor and bounty from God” in safety and profit “no harm touched them” of killing or hardship “and they pursued [His] pleasure.” God” by obeying Him and obeying His Messenger in going out “and God is full of great bounty” to those who obey Him “that is only” that is, the one who says to you that people etc. “Satan frightens” you “his allies” the disbelievers “so do not fear them but fear Me” in abandoning My command “if you are believers” truly
j-0149	"""And let not those who hasten into disbelief grieve you"" with the dammah of the ya' and the kasrah of the zay and with the fathah of the zay from ahzannahu ""those who hasten into disbelief"" who fall into it quickly by supporting him and they are the people of Mecca or the hypocrites, that is, do not pay attention to their disbelief ""they will never harm Allah at all"" with their actions, but rather they will harm themselves ""Allah intends not to grant them any portion"" a share ""in the Hereafter"" that is, Paradise, so Allah will let them down ""and for them is a great punishment"" in the Fire. ""Indeed, those who have purchased disbelief in exchange for faith"" that is, they took it instead of it ""will never harm Allah at all, and for them is a painful punishment"" painful. ""And let not those who disbelieve think"" with the ya' and the ta' ""that Our granting them respite"" that is, Our granting them respite ""is better for themselves"" and that and its object replace the two objects in the lower reading and replace the second in the other ""We only grant them respite"" We give them respite ""that they may increase in sin"" by committing many sins ""and for them is a humiliating punishment"" with humiliation in The Hereafter

“Allah would not leave” to leave “the believers as you are” O people “in the state of mixing the sincere with others “until He distinguishes” with the light and heavy, separating “the wicked” the hypocrite “from the good” the believer with the difficult duties explained for that, so He did that on the day of Uhud. “And Allah would not inform you of the unseen” so that you would know the hypocrite from the non-hypocrite before distinguishing. “But Allah chooses” He selects “from among His messengers whomever He wills” and informs him of His unseen, just as He informed the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, of the state of the hypocrites. “So believe in Allah and His messengers. And if you believe and fear Allah” hypocrisy, “then for you will be a great reward.”

“And let not those who withhold what Allah has given them of His bounty think” with the ya and the ta’ “that it” that is, their withholding “is good for them” a second object, and the pronoun is for separation, and the first is their withholding, understood before the connection and before the pronoun, with the lower “it is worse for them. They will be enveloped by what they withheld” that is, their withholding. From the money “on the Day of Resurrection” by making a snake around his neck that will bite him, as mentioned in the hadith. “And to God belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth.” He inherits them after their people perish. “And God is All-Aware of what you do,” with the letter “ta” and the letter “ya,” “so He will reward you for it.”"
j-0150	“Allah has heard the statement of those who said, ‘Allah is poor, and we are rich.’” They are the Jews. They said this when the verse, “Who is he that would lend Allah a goodly loan” was revealed. They said, “If He were rich, we would not have borrowed from Him?” “We will write down” We will command that “what they said” be written in their books of deeds so that they may be rewarded for it. In another reading, with the letter “ya” indicating the object, “and write down” in the accusative and nominative “their killing of the prophets without right, and We will say” with the letter “noon” and the letter “ya” meaning Allah will tell them in the Hereafter on the tongues of the angels, “Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire,” the Fire, and it will be said to them when they are thrown into it. “That” the punishment “is for what your hands have put forth,” He used it to refer to man because most actions are performed by it, “and that Allah is not unjust” meaning unjust “to His servants,” so He punishes them without guilt. “Those” is an adjective for those before him, “said” to Muhammad, “Indeed, Allah has enjoined upon us” in the Torah “that we should not believe in a Messenger” we believe him “until he brings us an offering that the Fire will consume,” so we will not believe in you until you bring it to us, which is what brings one closer to Allah from Yes, and others. If a white fire came from the sky and burned it, otherwise it remained in its place and the Children of Israel were entrusted with that except in the Messiah and Muhammad. God Almighty said, “Say” to them as a rebuke, “There have come to you messengers before me with clear proofs” with miracles “and with what you said” like Zachariah and John, so you killed them. The address is to those in the time of our Prophet Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, even though the action was for their ancestors because they were pleased with it. “Then why did you kill them, if you should be truthful?” in that you believe when it is brought. “If they deny you, then messengers were denied before you who came with clear proofs” with miracles “and the scriptures” like the scrolls of Abraham “and the Book” and in a reading by confirming the ba’ in both of them “the enlightening” the clear one is the Torah and the Gospel, so be patient as they were patient.
j-0151	“Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your wages in full on the Day of Resurrection. So whoever is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained his goal. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion?” The falsehood that is enjoyed for a little while and then vanishes. “You will surely be tested” the nun of the nominative case was removed from it due to the succession of the nuns, and the waw is a plural pronoun due to the meeting of two quiescent letters. “You will surely be tested in your wealth” with the obligations therein and the needs “and yourselves” with worship and testing. “And you will surely hear from those who were given the Scripture before you” the Jews and Christians “and from those who associate others with God” from the Arabs “much abuse” from cursing, slander, and flirting with your women. “But if you are patient” in that “and fear God” with the obligations “then indeed that is of the matters [worthy of] determination” that is, of their determinations that are determined because they are obligatory.
j-0152	"“And” remember “when God took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture” that is, the covenant upon them in the Torah “to make it clear” that is, the Scripture “to the people and not to conceal it” that is, the Scripture with the ya’ and the ta’ in both verbs “but they cast it” they threw the covenant “behind their backs” so they did not act upon it “and purchased with it” they took instead “a small price” from the world from their lowest class with their leadership in knowledge so they concealed it for fear of losing it “so evil is that which they purchase” this purchase of theirs “Do not think” with the ya’ and the ta’ “those who rejoice in what they have done” they did of misleading the people “and love to be praised for what they have not done” of adhering to the truth while they are in error “so do not think them” in both versions, emphasis “in a desert” in a place where they will be saved “from the punishment” in the Hereafter, rather they are in a place where they will be punished, which is Hell “and for them is a painful punishment” painful in it and the object of the first “he thinks” is indicated by the objects of the second according to the reading of the lower one and according to The upper deletion of the second only
“And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth” the treasuries of rain, sustenance, plants, and others “And God is over all things competent” including the punishment of the unbelievers and the salvation of the believers"
j-0153	"“Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth” and what is in them of wonders “and the alternation of the night and the day” by coming and going and increasing and decreasing “are signs” indicating His Almighty power “for those of understanding” for those with intellects “who” is an adjective for what preceded it or a substitute “remember Allah while standing, sitting and on their sides” lying down, that is, in every situation. According to Ibn Abbas, they pray in this way according to their ability “and reflect on the creation of the heavens and the earth” to prove from it the power of their Creator. They say, “Our Lord, You did not create this” the creation that we see “in vain” in a state of vain, but rather as evidence of the perfection of Your power. “Glory be to You” purifying You from vain “so protect us from the punishment of the Fire” “Our Lord, indeed whomsoever You admit to the Fire” to remain there forever “You have disgraced” You have humiliated him “and for the wrongdoers” the disbelievers, in which the apparent is placed in place of the implicit to indicate that disgrace is reserved for them “of” an extra “helpers” who prevent them from the punishment of Allah Almighty. “Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller calling” calling to the people ""To faith"" meaning to Him, which is Muhammad or the Qur'an ""that"" meaning that ""believe in your Lord, so we have believed"" in Him ""Our Lord, so forgive us our sins and remit"" remove ""from us our misdeeds"" do not reveal them by punishing them ""and take us"" take our souls ""with"" in the group ""of the righteous"" the righteous prophets ""Our Lord, and give us"" give us ""what You promised us"" ""through"" the tongues of ""Your messengers"" of mercy and grace and their request for that, even though His promise, the Most High, does not fail to ask to make them among those who deserve it because they were not certain of their deserving it and repeating ""Our Lord"" is an exaggeration in supplication ""and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You do not fail in Your promise"" the promise of resurrection and recompense. ""So their Lord responded to them"" their supplication ""that I"" meaning that I ""do not allow to be lost the work of a worker among you, whether male or female. You are"" someone ""of one another"" meaning males from females and vice versa. The sentence confirms what preceded it, meaning that they are equal in being rewarded for deeds and not wasting them. It was revealed because Umm Salamah said O Messenger of God, I do not hear any mention of women in the migration. “So those who emigrated” from Mecca to Medina “and were expelled from their homes and harmed in My cause” My religion “and fought” the infidels “and were killed” with the emphasis and in another reading it is presented “I will surely remove from them their misdeeds” I will cover them with forgiveness “and I will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow as a reward” a source from the meaning of “I will surely remove” confirming it “from God” in it there is a shift from speaking “and God has with Him the best reward” the recompense."
j-0154	And it was revealed when the Muslims said, “The enemies of God, in what we see of goodness, while we are in the effort, ‘Let not the turning of those who disbelieve in the land deceive you,’” their behavior, “in the land,” in trade and earnings. It is “a brief enjoyment,” which they enjoy for a short time in this world and will perish. “Then their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place.” The bed is. “But those who fear their Lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding eternally therein,” meaning destined for eternity. “Therein is an accommodation,” which is what is prepared for the guest, and its accusative is in the state of gardens, and the factor in it is the meaning of the circumstance, “from God, and what is with God” of reward, “is better for the righteous” than the enjoyment of this world.
j-0155	“And indeed, among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in Allah” such as Abdullah ibn Salam and his companions and the Negus “and in what has been revealed to you” meaning the Qur’an “and what has been revealed to them” meaning the Torah and the Gospel “being humble” a state of the pronoun “believes” which has the meaning of “from” in it, i.e. humble “to Allah, not exchanging the signs of Allah” which they have in the Torah and the Gospel from the mission of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace “for a small price” of this world by concealing them for fear of losing leadership as other Jews did. “Those will have their reward” the reward for their deeds “with their Lord” they will be given it twice as in the stories. “Indeed, Allah is swift in account” He will hold creation to account in the amount of half a day of the days of this world. “O you who have believed, be patient” in acts of obedience and calamities and from sins “and endure” the disbelievers so that they will not be more patient than you “and remain steadfast” persist in jihad “and fear Allah” in all your circumstances “that you may succeed” win Paradise and be saved from the Fire.
j-0156	“O mankind,” that is, the people of Mecca, “fear your Lord,” that is, His punishment by obeying Him, “Who created you from one soul,” Adam, “and created from it its mate,” Eve, with a long vowel from one of his left ribs, “and dispersed,” separated and spread, “from them,” from Adam and Eve, “many men and women,” many, “and fear Allah, through whom you ask one another,” in which the ta’ in the original is assimilated into the seen, and in a reading with a light vowel by deleting it, that is, you ask one another “by Him,” where some of you say to one another, “I ask you by Allah, and I implore you by Allah,” “and” fear “the wombs,” lest you sever them, and in a reading with a jar, in apposition to the pronoun in “by Him,” and they used to implore one another by the womb. “Indeed, Allah is ever, over you, an Observer,” preserving your deeds and rewarding you for them, that is, He has always been characterized by that.
j-0157	"And it was revealed about an orphan who asked his guardian for his money, but he refused him. “And give the orphans” the young ones who have no father “their money” when they reach maturity. “And do not exchange the bad” the forbidden “for the good” the permissible, that is, take it in its place as you do when you take the good money of an orphan and put the bad money in its place. “And do not consume their money” with your money. Indeed, consuming it “is a great sin.” When it was revealed, they were embarrassed to take care of orphans, and among them were those who had ten or eight wives, so he should not be just between them. So it was revealed. “And if you fear that you will not be just with the orphans” so you were embarrassed about their affair, so you also feared that you would not be just between the women when you married them. “Then marry” marry “those” with the meaning of “whom” “that are lawful for you of women, two or three or four” meaning two or three or four, and do not exceed that. “But if you fear that you will not be just” ""Be just"" in spending and dividing ""then marry one"" ""or"" limit yourself to ""what your right hands possess"" of female slaves since they do not have the same rights as wives ""that"" that is marrying four only or one or taking concubines ""is less"" closer to ""not being unjust"" ""and give"" give ""to women their dowries"" the plural of sadaqah is their dowries ""as a gift"" the source of a gift willingly ""but if they give up willingly to you any of it"" the distinguishing feature transferred from the subject meaning their souls are willing to give you any of the dowry so they give it to you ""then eat it in enjoyment"" good ""and with pleasure"" praiseworthy in the end, no harm in it for you in the hereafter. It was revealed in response to the dislike of that ""and do not give"" O guardians ""to the foolish"" the wasteful men, women and children ""your wealth"" that is their wealth that is in your hands ""which Allah has made a means of support for you"" the source of qama meaning it supports your livelihood and the well-being of your children, so they spend it in other than its intended purpose. In another reading it is qiyama Collect the value of what the luggage is worth. “And provide for them therein,” that is, feed them from it, “and clothe them, and speak to them a kind word.” Count them a beautiful provision by giving them their money if they are mature. “And test,” test, “the orphans,” before they reach puberty in their religion and their management of their affairs, “until they reach the age of marriage,” that is, they become eligible for it by puberty or the age, which is the completion of fifteen years according to al-Shafi’i. “Then if you perceive,” see, “in them soundness,” righteousness in their religion and their money, “then release their property to them and do not consume it,” O guardians, “extravagantly,” without right, “or hasten to spend it,” that is, rush to spend it for fear “that they will grow up,” mature, and you will be obliged to hand it over to them. “And whoever,” of the guardians, “is rich, let him abstain,” that is, let him abstain from the orphan’s money and refrain from eating it. “And whoever is poor, let him eat” from it “according to what is reasonable,” according to the wages of his work. “Then when you release to them,” that is, to the orphans, “their property, have witnesses over them,” that they have received it. And you were acquitted so that there would be no disagreement, so you would return to the evidence. This is a matter of guidance. “And sufficient is God” - the “ya” is an extra “as Accountant” - as Preserver of the deeds of His creation and their Accountant."
j-0158	It was revealed in response to what was the case in the days of ignorance, of not giving inheritance to women and children. “Men” children and relatives “share” a portion “of what the parents and close relatives leave” the deceased “and women have a share of what the parents and close relatives leave, whether it is little” that is, the money “or much” God made it “an obligatory portion” that is determined by handing it over to them. “And when the division” of the inheritance “is attended by the relatives” the relatives who do not inherit “and the orphans and the needy, give them from it” something before the division “and speak” O guardians “to them” if the heirs are young “with an honorable word” nicely by apologizing to them that you do not own it and that it is for the young. This is said to have been abrogated and it is said not, but people are lax in leaving it, and accordingly it is recommended. According to Ibn Abbas, it is obligatory. “And let him fear” that is, let him be afraid for the orphans “who, if they should leave behind them” that is, after their death, “weak offspring” young children “would fear.” “And let them fear Allah” in the matter of orphans and let them do to them what they would like to be done to their offspring after them “and let them speak” to the deceased “a sound word” correct by ordering him to give in charity less than a third of his wealth and leave the rest for his heirs and not leave them dependent. “Indeed, those who consume the property of orphans unjustly” without right “are only consuming into their bellies” that is, filling them “fire” because it will go to them “and they will burn” in the active and passive form they will enter “a blazing fire” a fierce fire in which they will be burned.

If there is one with him, then she gets a third and he gets two thirds. If he is alone, the wealth is permissible. “But if they are” that is, the children “women” only “more than two, then for them are two thirds of what the deceased left” and likewise the two because it is for the two sisters by His saying “then for them are two thirds of what he left” so they are more deserving of it and because the daughter deserves a third with the male, so with the female it is more deserving and above it was said a connection and it was said to dispel the illusion of an increase in the share by increasing the number because it was understood that the two daughters deserve two thirds from making the third for the one with the male “and if” the newborn “is one” and in a reading with the nominative it was complete “then for her is half and for his parents” that is, the deceased and it is substituted for them “for each one of them is a sixth of what he left if he had a child” male or female and the point of the substitute is to indicate that they do not share in it and the son’s child is attributed to the son and the grandfather is attributed to the father “but if he has no child and his parents inherit him” only or with a husband ""For his mother"" with the hamza with a damma or kasra to avoid moving from a damma to a kasra due to its heaviness in both places ""a third"" meaning a third of the money or what is due after the husband and the rest is for the father ""but if he has brothers"" meaning two or more males or females ""then for his mother is a sixth"" and the rest is for the father and nothing is for the brothers and an inheritance from whomever is mentioned ""after"" the execution of ""a bequest he bequeaths"" in the construction of the subject and the object ""of it or"" the payment of ""a debt"" upon him and the presentation of the bequest over the debt even if it is delayed from him in fulfilling it to care for it ""your fathers and your sons"" subject and predicate ""you do not know which of them is nearer to you in benefit"" in this world and the hereafter so he thinks that his son is more beneficial to him so he gives him the inheritance so the father is more beneficial and vice versa and only God knows that so he imposed on you the inheritance ""an ordinance from God.

""and for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child"" from you or “From other than you, “But if they have a child, then for you is a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may have bequeathed or debt.” In this regard, the son’s child is included with the son by consensus. “And for them” i.e. wives, whether they are multiple or not, “is a fourth of what you leave if you do not have a child. But if you have a child” from them or from someone else, “they are an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may have bequeathed or debt.” The son’s child is like the son in this regard by consensus. “And if there is a man who inherits” an adjective and the predicate “by descendants” i.e. he has no father or child “or a woman” who inherits by descendants “and he” i.e. the deceased has descendants “by descendants” “a brother or sister” i.e. from the mother, and Ibn Mas’ud and others read it this way “for each one of them is a sixth” of what he left. “But if there are” i.e. brothers and sisters from the mother “more than that” i.e. from one “they are equal in a third” whether male or female “after any bequest he may have bequeathed or debt, not causing harm” a state of the pronoun “he bequeaths” i.e. not causing harm to the heirs by bequeathing more than a third, and God is Knowing” of what He planned for His creation the obligations, “Forbearing” in delaying the punishment for those who disobeyed Him, and the Sunnah specified the inheritance of those mentioned in it to those who are not prevented from killing, or differences in religion, or slavery."
j-0160	“And for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child” from you or from someone else “but if they have a child, then for you is a quarter of what they leave after any bequest they may have bequeathed or debt” and the son’s child is included with the child in this by consensus “and for them” that is, the wives, whether they are more than one or not “a quarter of what you leave if you have no child. But if you have a child” from them or from someone else “then for them is an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may have bequeathed or debt” and the son’s child is like the son in this by consensus “and if there is a man who inherits” the description and the predicate “as kalalah” that is, he has no father or child “or a woman” who inherits as kalalah “and he” that is, the deceased has as kalalah “a brother or sister” that is, from the mother, and Ibn Mas’ud and others read it this way “for each one of them is a sixth” of what he left “but if there are” that is, brothers and sisters from the mother “more than that” that is, from one “they are equal in a third” whether male or female “after any bequest he may have bequeathed or debt, without causing harm” a state of the pronoun he bequeaths, that is, without causing harm to the heirs by He recommends more than a third “a will” a confirmed source to recommend to you “from God, and God is Knowing” of what He has planned for His creation of obligations “Forbearing” in delaying punishment for those who disobey Him. The Sunnah has specified the inheritance of those mentioned with those who do not have a reason for killing or difference of religion or slavery. “Those” the rulings mentioned regarding orphans and what follows “the limits of God” His laws that He has set for His servants to work by and not transgress. “And whoever obeys God and His Messenger” in what He has ruled, “He will admit him” with the letter “ya” and the letter “nun” as a shift “to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein. That is the great attainment.” “And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger and transgresses His limits, He will admit him” with both faces “to a Fire to abide therein, and he” in it “will have a humiliating punishment” with humiliation. The pronouns in the two verses were taken into account, the word “from” and “in abiding therein” mean
j-0161	And those of your women who commit adultery, bring against them four witnesses from among you, that is, from your Muslim men. And if they testify against them, then detain them, confine them to houses and prevent them from mixing with people until death, that is, His angels, takes them, or until Allah makes for them a way out of it. They were commanded to do this at the beginning of Islam, then He made for them a way by flogging the virgin a hundred times and banishing her for a year, and stoning the married woman. And in the hadith when he explained the punishment, he said, “Take from me, take from me, Allah has made for them a way.” Narrated by Muslim. “And those two” with a light and heavy nun “who commit it” meaning the adultery or sodomy “among you” meaning the men “then harm them” by cursing and beating them with sandals “but if they repent” from it “and amend” their actions “then turn away from them” and do not harm them “for Allah is ever Forgiving” to those who repent “and Merciful” to them. This was abrogated by the punishment if it was intended for adultery, and likewise if it was intended for sodomy according to al-Shafi’i, but the one who is harmed is not stoned according to him. And if he is married, he is to be flogged and banished. The intention of sodomy is more apparent, as evidenced by the dual pronoun. The first intended the adulterer and the adulteress. This is refuted by their clarification by “who” connected to the pronoun of men and their sharing in harm, repentance, and turning away. It is specific to men, as was mentioned previously regarding women, regarding imprisonment.
j-0162	“Repentance is only for Allah” that is, the one He has decreed for Himself to accept by His grace “for those who do evil” disobedience “in ignorance” a state, i.e. ignorant when they disobey their Lord “and then repent” a “short time” before they are at the point of death “for those Allah will turn in forgiveness” He accepts their repentance “and Allah is ever Knowing” of His creation “Wise” in His treatment of them “But repentance is not for those who do evil deeds” sins “until, when death approaches one of them” and he begins to die “he says” upon seeing what he is in “Indeed, I repent now” but that does not benefit him and is not accepted from him “nor for those who die while they are disbelievers” if they repent in the Hereafter when they witness the punishment, it will not be accepted from them “for those We have prepared” We have prepared “a painful punishment” painful
j-0163	"“O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will” meaning themselves “by compulsion” with the fat-ha and the damma are two dialects, meaning those who forced them to do so were in the days of ignorance inheriting the wives of their relatives. If they wished, they could marry them without a dowry, or they could marry them and take their dowry, or they could prevent them until they ransomed themselves with what they inherited or died and inherited them. They were forbidden from doing that. “And do not prevent them” meaning prevent your wives from marrying others by keeping them, and you have no desire for them to cause harm “in order to take away part of what you gave them” of the dowry “unless they commit a clear immorality” with the fat-ha and kasra of the ya’ meaning it is clear or it is clear, meaning adultery or rebellion. Then you may harm them until they ransome themselves from you and divorce themselves. “And live with them in kindness” meaning in general terms in speech, spending, and spending the night. “But if you dislike them” then be patient “it may be that you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good” and perhaps He makes that in them by He will provide you with a righteous child from them.

“And if you wish to replace one wife with another” that is, take her in her place by divorcing her “and you have given one of them” that is, the wives “a great amount” as a dowry “then do not take from it anything. Would you take it by falsehood” wrongfully “and manifest sin” clearly? And the accusative of both of them is in the state and the question is for rebuke and denial in His statement

“And how would you take it” that is, in what way “while you have come” and connected “to one another” through intercourse stipulated for the dowry “and they have taken from you a firm covenant” a strong promise, which is what God has commanded of keeping them in kindness or releasing them with kindness"
j-0164	“And do not marry those” meaning “whom” “your fathers married of women except” but “what has already passed” of your doing that, then it is forgiven. “It” meaning marrying them “was an immorality” ugly “and hateful” a cause of hatred from God, which is the most intense hatred “and an evil” evil “way” that is. Your mothers are forbidden to you to marry, and this includes grandmothers from the father’s or mother’s side, and your daughters, and this includes the daughters of sons even if they are lower, and your sisters from the father’s or mother’s side, and your paternal aunts, that is, the sisters of your fathers and grandfathers, and your maternal aunts, that is, the sisters of your mothers and grandmothers, and your brother’s daughters, and this includes their children, and your mothers who breastfed you before completing two years, five times, as explained in the hadith, and your sisters by breastfeeding, and this is included in the Sunnah, and they are those who were breastfed by a woman with whom he had sexual intercourse, and the paternal aunts and maternal aunts, and the brother’s daughters and the sister’s daughters from her, according to the hadith that prohibits from breastfeeding what is prohibited by lineage. Narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim and the mothers of the Prophet. Your wives and your stepdaughters, the plural of stepdaughter, is the daughter of the wife from another man, who are in your guardianship and you raise them, a description that is consistent with the majority, so it is not understood from your wives with whom you have entered, that is, you have had intercourse with them. If you have not entered them, then there is no blame upon you in marrying their daughters if you separate from them, and the wives of the husbands of your sons who are from your loins, unlike those whom you have adopted, then you may marry their wives, and you may marry two sisters by blood or breastfeeding, and the Sunnah includes marrying her with her paternal or maternal aunt, and it is permissible to marry each one separately and own them both, and have intercourse with one, except for what has already occurred in the time of ignorance of their marriage to some of what was mentioned, then there is no blame upon you in it. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving of what has occurred from you before the prohibition, Merciful to you in that. “And” forbidden to you “are the chaste women” that you marry them before separating from their husbands, whether they are free Muslims or not, “except those whom your right hands possess” of slave girls through captivity, then you may have intercourse with them. And if they have husbands in the land of war after the waiting period, “the Book of God” is in the accusative case as a source, meaning He has written that “upon you, and lawful” in the active and passive form “for you is all that is beyond that,” meaning other than what He has forbidden you of women “that you seek” you seek women “with your wealth” as a dowry or a price “in marriage,” married, “not committing fornication,” “and whatever” “you enjoy” you enjoy “of them,” of those you marry by sexual intercourse, “give them their dowries,” their dowries that you have prescribed for them “as an obligation. And there is no blame upon you for what you agree upon,” you and they “after the obligation,” of reducing it or some of it or adding to it. “Indeed, God is ever Knowing,” of His creation, “Wise,” in what He has planned for them.
j-0165	And whoever among you cannot afford to marry chaste, free, believing women, is a common occurrence and has no meaning. So from those whom your right hands possess, he may marry from your believing girls. And Allah knows best about your faith, so be satisfied with its outward appearance and entrust the secrets to Him, for He knows best her preference. And there is a nation that is preferred, free in it. This is an introduction to the marriage of female slaves, some of you from others, meaning that you and they are equal in religion, so do not disdain to marry them, so marry them with the permission of their people, their masters, and give them their wages and dowries in a reasonable manner, without delay or reduction. They should be chaste, chaste, not fornicators, who commit adultery openly, nor take lovers who commit adultery with them secretly. Then when they become chaste, they marry. And in a reading with the active voice, they marry. But if they commit an immoral act of adultery, then upon them is half of what upon chaste, free, virgin women who commit adultery, of the punishment, the prescribed punishment. They should be flogged fifty times and exiled for half a year. And slaves are measured against them. And chastity was not made a condition for the obligation of the prescribed punishment, to indicate that there is no stoning. They are basically that, i.e. marrying slave girls when there is no length for whoever fears hardship, fornication, and its origin is hardship, it is called fornication because it is caused by the punishment in this world and the punishment in the hereafter from you, unlike whoever does not fear it from the free men, it is not permissible for him to marry her. And likewise whoever is able to marry a free woman, and Al-Shafi’i agreed with him, and he excluded from his saying from your believing girls the disbelieving ones, it is not permissible for him to marry her even if he is just and fears, and that you be patient about marrying slave girls is better for you so that the child does not become a slave, and God is Forgiving and Merciful with the expansion in that
j-0166	"“Allah desires to make clear to you” the laws of your religion and the interests of your affairs “and guide you to the ways” the methods “of those before you” of the prophets in what is permissible and what is forbidden, so follow them “and turn to you” return you from the disobedience to Him that you were doing to obeying Him “and Allah is Knowing” of you “and Wise” in what He has planned for you
“and Allah desires to accept your repentance” He repeated it to build on it “and those who follow their lusts” the Jews and Christians or the Magians or the fornicators “desire that you should deviate greatly” deviate from the truth by committing what is forbidden to you so that you become like them
“Allah desires to lighten your burden” make the rulings of the law easy for you “and man was created weak” he cannot be patient with women and lusts"
j-0167	“O you who have believed, do not consume one another’s wealth unjustly” through what is forbidden in Islamic law, such as usury and usurpation “except” but “that it be” it occurs “in trade” and in a reading in the accusative case, the money is trade money issued “by mutual consent” and with good will, so you may consume it “and do not kill yourselves” by committing what leads to their destruction, whatever it may be in this world or the hereafter, according to the evidence “for Allah is to you ever Merciful” in forbidding you from that. “And whoever does that” that is, what He has forbidden “in aggression” transgressing against what is permissible, a state of affairs, “and wrongfully” an emphasis, “We will drive him” We will put him “in a Fire” in which he will burn “and that, for Allah, is easy” easy.
j-0168	“If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden,” which are those for which there is a threat, such as fighting, adultery, and theft. According to Ibn Abbas, it is closer to seven hundred, “We will remove from you your misdeeds,” the minor sins through acts of obedience, “and admit you to a noble entrance,” with the “mim” pronounced with a damma or fatha, meaning an entrance or place, “which is Paradise.”
j-0169	“And do not wish for what Allah has given some of you over others” in terms of this world or religion, lest it lead to envy and hatred. “For men is a share” reward “of what they have earned” because of what they have done in jihad and other things. “And for women is a share of what they have earned” of obeying their husbands and guarding their private parts. It was revealed when Umm Salamah said, “If only we were men so we could fight and have the same reward as men.” “And ask” with a hamza and without it “of Allah’s bounty” whatever you need, and He will give you. “Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing of all things.” And from Him is the place of the bounty and your asking. “And for each” on behalf of men and women “We have made heirs” a clan who are given “of what the parents and near relatives leave” to them of wealth. “And those with whom you have made a covenant” with an alif and without it “your oaths” plural of oath meaning an oath or hand, meaning the caliphs with whom you made a covenant in the days of ignorance to support and inherit. “So give them” now “their share” their portions of the inheritance, which is one-sixth. “Indeed, Allah is over all things.” “A witness” is informed, and from it is your condition. This is abrogated by His statement: “And those of kinship are closer to one another.”
j-0170	“Men are in charge of women,” disciplining them and taking them by the hand, “by [right of] what Allah has given one over the other,” that is, by His giving them preference over them in knowledge, reason, guardianship, and other things, “and by what they spend” on them “from their wealth. So the righteous women” among them “are obedient,” obedient to their husbands, “guarding [their affairs] in [their] absence,” that is, their private parts and other things in the absence of their husbands, “by what Allah has guarded” for them, since He has commanded their husbands to deal with them. “And as for those on whose part you fear rebellion,” that is, their disobedience to you, by showing signs of it, “admonish them,” so make them fear Allah, “and leave them alone in the beds,” withdraw to another bed if they show rebellion, “and strike them,” a light strike if they do not return to abandonment. “But if they obey you,” in what is desired of them, “then seek not,” seek, “against them a way,” a way to strike them unjustly. “For Allah is ever High, Grand,” so beware of Him punishing you if you wrong them. “And if you fear” if you know “a breach” a disagreement “between them” between the spouses, and the addition is for expansion, meaning a breach between them, “then send” to them with their consent “an arbitrator” a just man “from his family” his relatives “and an arbitrator from her family” and the husband delegates his judgment in divorce and accepting compensation from him and she delegates her judgment in divorce, so they strive and order the wrongdoer to return or separate if they see fit. God Almighty said, “If they both desire” meaning the two arbitrators “to set things right, God will cause them to agree” between the spouses, meaning He will enable them to do what is obedience, whether it is setting things right or separating. “Indeed, God is ever Knowing” of everything “Aware” of the inner as well as the outer.
j-0171	"“And worship Allah” declare Him alone “and associate nothing with Him, and” be good “to parents with goodness” righteousness and kindness “and to relatives” kinship “and orphans and the needy and the neighbor who is near you” close to you in neighborhood or kinship “and the neighbor who is far away” far from you in neighborhood or kinship “and the companion at your side” a companion in travel or business, and it was said the wife “and the wayfarer” one who is stranded on his journey “and those whom your right hands possess” of slaves “for Allah does not like anyone who is arrogant” proud “boasting” towards people of what he has been given “who” subject “are stingy” with what is due to them “and enjoin stinginess” with it “and conceal what Allah has given them of His bounty” of knowledge and wealth, and they are the Jews, and the predicate of the subject for them is a severe threat “and We have prepared for the disbelievers” in that and other things “a humiliating punishment” 
“and those” in apposition to those before it “who spend their wealth to be seen by people” showing off to them “and do not believe” ""In God and the Last Day"" like the hypocrites and the people of Mecca ""And whoever has Satan as a companion"" a companion who acts according to his command like these ""then what a bad companion"" he is ""And what would be upon them if they believed in God and the Last Day and spent from what God has provided them"" meaning what harm would there be to them in that? The question is for denial and ""even"" is a source meaning there is no harm in it, but rather the harm is in what they are doing ""And God is Knowing of them"" so He will reward them for what they have done ""Indeed, God does not wrong"" anyone ""by the weight"" of an atom, the smallest ant, by reducing it from his good deeds or increasing it from his bad deeds ""And if"" the atom ""is a good deed"" from a believer, and in another reading it is in the nominative case, then it was complete ""He multiplies it"" from ten to more than seven hundred, and in another reading He doubles it with emphasis ""And gives from Him"" ​​from Him with the multiplication ""a great reward"" that no one can estimate"
j-0172	“How will it be then, when We bring from every nation a witness,” who will testify against it regarding its actions, and he is its prophet, “and We bring you, O Muhammad, as a witness over these people?” “On that Day,” the Day of Coming, “those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were leveled with them,” in the passive and active form, with one of the two ta’s omitted in the original and with its assimilation into the seen, meaning that the earth would be leveled with them, so that they would be dust like it, due to the enormity of its horror, as in another verse. And the disbeliever will say, “Oh, I wish I were dust.” “And they will not conceal from Allah a word,” about what they did, and at another time they will conceal it and say, “By God, our Lord, we were not polytheists.”
j-0173	“O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated” from drinking, because the reason for its revelation was congregational prayer while intoxicated “until you know what you are saying” by becoming sober “nor in a state of major ritual impurity” from penetration or ejaculation, and the accusative is in the state of being, and it is used for the singular and other than it “except those passing through” those who are traveling “until you wash yourselves” so you may pray, and the exception of the traveler because he has another ruling that will come, and it was said that what is meant is the prohibition of approaching the places of prayer, meaning the mosques, except passing through them without staying, “and if you are ill” an illness that is harmed by water “or on a journey” meaning traveling and you are major ritual impurity or in a state of minor ritual impurity “or one of you comes from the privy” it is the place prepared for relieving oneself, meaning he has relieved himself “or you have had contact with women” and in a reading without an alif, and both of them mean touching, it is touching with the hand, Ibn Omar said, and Al-Shafi’i agreed with it, and touching with the rest of the skin was added to it, and from Ibn Abbas it is sexual intercourse “and you do not find water” with which to purify yourselves for prayer after seeking and searching, and it refers to what is other than the sick. “Then perform tayammum,” meaning after the time has begun, “a good surface,” pure dirt, then strike with it twice, “and wipe your faces and your hands,” with the elbows of it, and wipe beyond itself, and literally, “Indeed, God is Pardoning, Forgiving.”
j-0174	“Have you not seen those who have been given a portion of the Scripture?” They are the Jews. “They purchase error” in exchange for guidance “and wish you to go astray from the path” to stray from the right path so that you may be like them. “And Allah knows best about your enemies” than you do, so He informs you of them so that you may avoid them. “And sufficient is Allah as a protector” to protect you from them. “And sufficient is Allah as a helper” to prevent you from their plots. “Among those who are Jews” are a people “who distort” change “the words” that Allah revealed in the Torah describing Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, “from their [proper] places” in which they were placed. “And they say” to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when he orders them to do something, “We hear” your saying “and we disobey” your order. “And hear, but we do not hear” a state meaning a supplication, i.e. you do not hear. “And” they say to him, “Ra’ina” and he forbade addressing him, which is a word of abuse in their language. “It is a distortion” distortion “with their tongues and an attack” cast aspersion “on the religion” Islam. “And if they had said, “We hear and obey” they would have disobeyed and disobeyed. “And listen” only “and look at us” look at us instead of “look at us” “it would have been better for them” than what they said “and more upright” more just than that “but God has cursed them” distanced them from His mercy “for their disbelief, so they do not believe except a few of them” like Abdullah bin Salam and his companions.
j-0175	“O you who have been given the Scripture, believe in what We have revealed, confirming what is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them back, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers among them. And the command of Allah is His decree, which will be fulfilled.” When it was revealed, Abdullah ibn Salam became Muslim. It was said that it was a threat with a condition, but when some of them became Muslim, it was lifted. It was said that the obliteration and erasure will be before the Hour comes. “Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills.” He forgives him by admitting him into Paradise without punishment. And whoever He wills among the believers, He punishes for his sins and then admits him into Paradise. “And whoever associates with Allah has certainly invented a tremendous sin.”
j-0176	“Have you not seen those who claim themselves to be pure?” They are the Jews, when they said, “We are the sons of God and His beloved.” That is, it is not a matter of their purifying themselves. “Rather, God purifies whom He wills.” Through faith. “And they are not wronged.” They do not reduce their deeds “by a thread.” The size of a date seed’s shell. “Look,” in astonishment, “how they invent falsehood against God.” That is “and sufficient is that as a manifest sin.” Clearly.
j-0177	And it was revealed about Ka`b ibn al-Ashraf and other Jewish scholars like him when they came to Mecca and witnessed the dead of Badr and incited the polytheists to take revenge for them and fight the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace: “Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe in jibt and taghut and say to those who disbelieve” Abu Sufyan and his companions when they said to them: “We are more guided in way and we are the guardians of the House. We provide water for the pilgrims and welcome the guest and free the captive and do what Muhammad did, even though he opposed the religion of his fathers and severed the ties of kinship and left the sanctuary. “These” that is, you “are more guided than those who believe in way” the straightest path. “Those are the ones whom God has cursed, and he whom God curses, you will never find for him a helper” to prevent His punishment. “Or” rather, “they have a portion of the kingdom” that is, they have nothing of it even if it were there. “Then they would not give the people a speck” that is, something insignificant, the size of a speck in the back of a date pit, due to their extreme stinginess. “Or” rather, “they envy the people” that is, the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “for what they have.” God gave them of His bounty” of prophethood and many women, meaning they wished for it to be taken away from him and said that if he were a prophet he would be busy with women. “We gave the family of Abraham” his grandfather, such as Moses, David and Solomon “the Scripture and wisdom” and prophethood “and conferred upon them a great kingdom” so David had ninety-nine wives and Solomon had a thousand between free women and concubines. “And among them were those who believed in him” in Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “and among them were those who turned away” turned away “from him” so they did not believe. “And sufficient is Hell as a blazing fire” as a punishment for those who do not believe.
j-0178	“Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses - We will drive them into a Fire, burning in it. Whenever their skins are roasted through, We will replace them with other skins, that they may taste the punishment, that they may experience its severity. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might, Wise in His creation. And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. They will have therein purified spouses, free from menstruation and all impurity, and We will admit them to a deep shade, permanent, which the sun cannot remove, and it is the shade of Paradise.”
j-0179	“Allah commands you to render trusts” that is, the rights entrusted to him “to their rightful owners” was revealed when Ali, may Allah be pleased with him, took the key to the Kaaba from Uthman ibn Talhah, the chamberlain, its custodian, by force when the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to Mecca in the year of the conquest and prevented him, saying, “If I had known that he was the Messenger of Allah, I would not have prevented him.” So the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ordered it to be returned to him and said, “Here you are, eternal and everlasting.” So he was amazed by that, so Ali recited the verse to him, so he converted to Islam and gave it to his brother Shaybah upon his death, so it remained among his children. And even though the verse was mentioned for a specific reason, its generality is considered by the evidence of the plural. “And when you judge between people” He commands you “to judge with justice. Indeed, Allah is an excellent” in it is the assimilation of the mim of na’am into the indefinite relative ma, meaning an excellent thing “with which He admonishes you” to return the trust and judge with justice. “Indeed, Allah is Hearing” of what is said “Seeing” of what is done. “O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those” and those in charge “of the matter” that is, the governors “among you” if They commanded you to obey God and His Messenger. “But if you dispute” if you differ “about anything, refer it to God” that is, to His Book “and the Messenger” during his life and after it to his Sunnah, that is, reveal to him from them “if you believe in God and the Last Day. That” that is, referring to them “is better” for you than dispute and speaking according to one’s own opinion “and better in outcome” as a result.
j-0180	And it was revealed when a Jew and a hypocrite were arguing, so the hypocrite called Ka`b ibn al-Ashraf to judge between them, and he called the Jew to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and they went to him, and he ruled in favor of the Jew, but the hypocrite was not satisfied. Then they went to `Umar, and the Jew mentioned that, and he said to the hypocrite, “Is that so?” He said, “Yes,” so he killed him. “Have you not seen those who claim that they have believed in what was revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you? They wish to refer their case to Taghut,” the one who is very tyrannical, and that is Ka`b ibn al-Ashraf, “while they have been commanded to disbelieve in him,” and not to befriend him. “And Satan wishes to lead them far astray,” from the truth. “And when it is said to them, ‘Come to what God has revealed,’ in the Qur’an of judgment, “and to the Messenger,” to judge between you, “you see the hypocrites turning away,” turning away, “from you,” to someone other than you, “with aversion?” “So how,” what will they do, “when a disaster befalls them,” a punishment, “for what their hands have put forth,” of disbelief and sins, that is, are they able to turn away and flee from it? “Then they come to you,” is conjoined with turning away. They swear by God that We intended nothing but goodness and reconciliation in referring the case to someone other than you. Those are the ones in whose hearts God knows what is in their hearts, of hypocrisy and their lies in their excuses. So turn away from them, pardon them, admonish them, frighten them with God, and speak to them concerning themselves a far-reaching word, affecting them, that is, admonish them so that they may turn back from their disbelief.
j-0181	“And We did not send any Messenger except to be obeyed” in what he commands and judges “by God’s permission” by His command, not to be disobeyed and contradicted. “And if, when they wronged themselves” by resorting to the tyrant “they had come to you” repentant “and asked forgiveness of God and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them” in this shift from the address in order to magnify his status “they would have found God Forgiving” to them “and Merciful” to them. “But no, by your Lord” “la” is redundant “they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute” that is mixed “and then find within themselves no discomfort” distress or doubt “from what you have judged” “and submit” to your judgment “in [full] submission” without opposition.
j-0182	“And if We had decreed for them” interpreter “kill yourselves or leave your homes” as We decreed for the Children of Israel “they would not have done it” that is, what was decreed for them “except a few” in the nominative case as a substitute and in the accusative case as an exception “of them. And if they had done what they were advised” of obeying the Messenger, may God bless him and grant him peace “it would have been better for them and a firmer confirmation” in fulfillment of their faith. “And if” that is, if they had been steadfast “We would have given them from Ourself” from Us “a great reward” which is Paradise. “And We would have guided them to a straight path” Some of the Companions said to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “How can we see you in Paradise when you are in the highest ranks and we are below you?” So he descended. “And whoever obeys God and the Messenger” in what he commanded “they will be with those upon whom God has bestowed favor of the prophets and the steadfast ones” the best companions of the prophets because of their extreme truthfulness and belief “and the martyrs” those killed in the way of God “and the righteous” other than those mentioned “and excellent are those as companions” companions in Paradise in which he enjoys seeing them and visiting them. And to be present with them, even if their position is in high ranks in relation to others. “That” meaning that they are with the mention of a subject whose predicate is “the grace of God” He bestowed upon them, not that they attained it through their obedience. “And God is sufficient as Knower” of the reward of the Hereafter, meaning trust in what He has informed you of, and no one can inform you like the All-Knower.
j-0183	“O you who have believed, take your precautions” from your enemy, that is, be on your guard against him and be alert for him. “Then go forth” rise up to fight him “firmly” dispersing one group after another “or go forth all together” together. “And indeed, among you is he who lingers” to delay the fighting, such as Abdullah bin Ubayy the hypocrite and his companions, and he made him one of them in terms of appearance, and the lam in the verb is for swearing. “But if a disaster befalls you” such as killing or defeat “he says, ‘Allah has bestowed favor upon me in that I was not with them as a witness’” present, so he was afflicted. “And if” the lam of swearing “a favor from Allah has befallen you” such as victory and booty “he will surely say” regretfully “as if” lightened and its subject is deleted, that is, as if “there had not been” with the ya and the ta’ “between you and him affection” knowledge and friendship. This goes back to His saying, “Allah has bestowed favor upon” which he interrupted between the statement and what it is said, and it is “Oh” for emphasis. “If only I had been with them so I could attain a great attainment” I would have taken a generous share of the spoils. God Almighty said:
j-0184	“So let those fight in the cause of Allah” to exalt His religion “who exchange” sell “the life of this world for the Hereafter. And whoever fights in the cause of Allah and is killed” is martyred “or is victorious” is victorious over his enemy “We will give him a great reward” a generous reward. “And what is the matter with you that you do not fight” is a question of rebuke, meaning there is nothing preventing you from fighting “in the cause of Allah and” to free “the oppressed among men, women and children” whom the infidels prevented from emigrating and harmed. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, said that my mother and I were among them “who say” supplicating, “O our Lord, take us out of this city” Mecca “whose people are oppressors” by disbelief “and appoint for us from Yourself a protector” from Yourself “and appoint for us from Yourself a helper” who will protect us from them. And Allah answered their supplication and made it easy for some of them to leave, and some of them remained until Mecca was conquered and the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, appointed Atab ibn Asid as his successor, so he gave justice to their oppressed ones from their oppressors. “Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah and those who They disbelieved and fought in the cause of the tyrant (Satan). So fight the allies of Satan, the supporters of his religion. Overpower them because of your strength in God. Indeed, the plot of Satan against the believers has ever been weak.
j-0185	“Have you not considered those who were told, ‘Restrain your hands’ from fighting the infidels when they asked them to in Mecca because of the infidels’ harm to them? They were a group of the Companions. “And establish prayer and give zakah.” But when fighting was prescribed for them, at once a party of them feared the people, the infidels, that is, their punishment by killing, “as they feared” the punishment of God, “or with a greater fear” than their fear of Him. “Ash-Shadd” is in the accusative case and is an answer to what is indicated by “if” and what follows it, that is, fear surprised them. “And they said,” in fear of death, “Our Lord, why did You prescribe fighting for us? Why did You not delay us for a short term?” Say, to them, “The enjoyment of this world” what is enjoyed in it or its enjoyment “is little” destined to perish. “And the Hereafter” that is, Paradise “is better for him who fears God” the punishment of God by abandoning His disobedience. “And you will not be wronged” with the ta’ and the ya’, deducting from your deeds “a thread” the size of a date pit’s shell. So strive “wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you were in towers” ​​fortified, “highly built up,” so that you would not…” They feared fighting, fearing death. “And if good befalls them,” meaning the Jews, “they say, ‘This is from God,’ but if evil befalls them,” drought and calamity, as they had when the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, arrived in Medina, “they say, ‘This is from you,’” O Muhammad, meaning because of your bad luck. “Say, ‘All,’ both good and evil, “are from God,’” from Him. “Then what is the matter with these people that they can hardly understand a statement” that is presented to them? “What is the matter with these people that they can hardly understand a statement” that is presented to them. “What is the matter with them that they can hardly understand a statement” that is presented to them? “What is the matter with them that they can hardly understand a statement” that is presented to them. ...
j-0186	"""Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah, and whoever turns away has turned away from your obedience, so do not worry about them. We have not sent you as a guardian over them"" to guard their deeds, but as a warner. And to Us is their affair, so We will recompense them. This is before the command to fight. ""And they say"" that is, the hypocrites when they come to you with our command ""in obedience"" to you. ""But when they go forth"" they go out ""from you, a party of them will stay"" by assimilating the ta' into the ta' and leaving it out, that is, they implied ""other than what you say"" to you in your presence of obedience, that is, your disobedience. ""And Allah records"" He orders the writing of ""what they spend the night"" in their scrolls so that they may be recompensed for it. ""So turn away from them"" with forgiveness ""and rely upon Allah"" trust in Him, for He is sufficient for you. ""And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs"" entrusted to Him. ""Do they not then consider"" contemplate ""the Qur'an"" and what is in it of beautiful meanings? ""Had it been from other than Allah, they would have found therein much discrepancy"" contradiction in its meanings and variation in its arrangement. ""And when a command comes to them"" about The raiding parties of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, what they had “of security” of victory “or fear” of defeat “they spread about it” they spread it, it was revealed to a group of hypocrites or to the weak believers who used to do that so the hearts of the believers would weaken and the Prophet would be harmed “and if they had referred it” that is the news “to the Messenger and to those in authority among them” that is the opinion of the senior Companions, that is if they had kept quiet about it until they were informed “it would have been known” whether it is something that should be spread or not “those who deduce it” follow it and seek its knowledge and they are the broadcasters “among them” from the Messenger and those in authority “and if it were not for the grace of God upon you” through Islam “and His mercy” to you through the Qur’an “you would have followed Satan” in what he commands you of indecencies “except for a few” So fight, O Muhammad, in the cause of God, you are only responsible for yourself, so do not be concerned about their lagging behind you, meaning fight even if you are alone, for you are promised victory and urge the believers, urge them to fight and encourage them to do so, perhaps God will restrain the violence of the war of those who disbelieve, and God is more severe in violence than them and more severe in punishment and torment than them, so the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: By the One in Whose hand is my soul In his hand, I will go out even if I am alone. So he went out with seventy riders to Badr Al-Sughra. God restrained the power of the infidels by casting terror into their hearts and preventing Abu Sufyan from going out, as mentioned previously in Al Imran."
j-0187	“Whoever intercedes” for people “with a good intercession” in accordance with the Shari’ah “will have a share” of the reward “from it” because of it “and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession” contrary to it “will have a share” of the burden “from it” because of it “and Allah is ever Aware of all things” Powerful, so He rewards everyone according to what he has done “And when you are greeted with a greeting” as if you were told, “Peace be upon you,” “greet” the one greeting “with one better than it” by saying to him, “upon you be peace and the mercy of Allah and His blessings.” “Return it” by saying to him as he said, meaning one of them is obligatory, and the first is better “for Allah is ever, over all things, a Reckoner” an Accountant, so He rewards him for it, and from this is returning the greeting. The Sunnah has singled out the infidel, the innovator, the sinner, and the Muslim over the one who is relieving himself, the one in the bathroom, and the one eating, so it is not obligatory to return them, rather it is disliked in other than the latter, and it is said to the infidel, “And upon you” “Allah, there is no god but Him” and Allah “will surely gather you” from your graves “to” on “the Day of Resurrection, there is no doubt” no suspicion “about it.” And whoever” meaning No one is more truthful in speech than God.
j-0188	When some people returned from Uhud, people differed about them. One group said, “Kill them,” and another group said, “No.” Then the following verse was revealed: “What is the matter with you?” What is your affair? You have become “two parties concerning the hypocrites.” “And Allah has turned them back” “for what they have earned” of disbelief and sins. “Do you want to guide one whom Allah has led astray?” That is, count them among the group of those who are guided? The question in both places is for denial. “And he whom Allah leads astray, you will never find for him a way” a path to guidance. “They wish” they wished “that you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be” you and they “alike” in disbelief. “So do not take from them allies” befriend them even if they show faith “until they emigrate in the cause of Allah” a valid emigration that confirms their faith. “But if they turn away” and remain as they are, “then seize them” by taking them captive “and kill them wherever you find them. And do not take from them an ally” befriend him “or a helper” through whom you can triumph over your enemy.
j-0189	“Except those who come to a people between whom and you there is a treaty” a covenant of safety for them and for those who come to them, as the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, made a covenant with Hilal ibn ‘Uwaimir al-Aslami “or” those who “come to you” and whose hearts are “constrained” are constricted “from fighting you” with their people “or fighting their people” with you, meaning refraining from fighting you and fighting them, so do not expose yourself to them by taking or killing. This is what follows it is abrogated by the verse of the sword. “And if God had willed” to give them power over you, “He would have given them power over you” by strengthening their hearts “and they would have fought you” but He did not will it, so He cast terror into their hearts. “But if they withdraw from you and do not fight you and offer you peace” peace, meaning they submit “then God has not made for you a way against them” a way by taking and fighting. “You will find others who desire to be secure from you” by showing faith to you “and secure from their people” by disbelief if they return to them, and they are Asad and Ghatafan “whenever they return “To the fitnah” they called to polytheism “throw yourself into it” they fell into it most severely “so if they do not withdraw from you” by abandoning fighting you “and” do not “offer you peace” and “do not restrain their hands” from you “then seize them” by taking them captive “and kill them wherever you find them” you find them “and over them We have given you a clear authority” a clear and apparent proof of their killing and taking them captive because of their treachery
j-0190	“And it is not for a believer to kill a believer” that is, he should not kill him “except by mistake” by mistake in killing him without intending to. “And whoever kills a believer by mistake” by intending to shoot someone else, such as a game or a tree, and he hits him or hits him with something that usually does not kill, “then the freeing” of a “believing slave” is upon him “and a blood money is due” paid “to his family” that is, the heirs of the slain person “unless they give it in charity” by pardoning it. The Sunnah explained that it is one hundred camels, twenty young female camels, and also two-year-old female camels, two-year-old male camels, one-year-old female camels, and two-year-old female camels, and it is upon the killer’s clan, who are his agnates, except for the origin and the descendants, distributed among them over three years, with the rich among them half a dinar and the middle-class a quarter of each year. If that is not enough, then it is from the public treasury, and if that is not possible, then it is upon the perpetrator. “But if” the slain person “is from a people at war with you, and he is a believer, then the freeing of a believing slave” is upon his killer as an expiation and no blood money is due to be given to his family for fighting them. “And if” the slain person “is from a people at war with you” “Between you and them is a covenant” like the People of the Covenant “a ransom” for him “delivered to his family” which is one-third of the blood money of a believer if he is a Jew or a Christian and one-third of it if he is a Zoroastrian “and the freeing of a believing slave” for his killer “but whoever cannot find” the slave by losing it and what he can obtain “then fasting for two consecutive months” is an expiation for him. God Almighty did not mention moving to food like zihar, and this is what Al-Shafi’i took in the most correct of his two opinions “repentance from God” a source accusative with its implied verb “and God is Knowing” of His creation “and Wise” in what He planned for them “and whoever kills a believer intentionally” by intending to kill him with what kills often knowing his faith “his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and the wrath and the curse of God are upon him” He distanced him from His mercy “and a great punishment is prepared for him” in the Fire. This is interpreted as someone who considers it permissible or that this is his recompense if it is permitted and it is not repelled in the back of the threat according to His saying and He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And from Ibn Abbas that it is according to its apparent meaning and that it abrogates other than it from Verses of forgiveness and the verse of the cow made it clear that the intentional killer is killed for it and that he must pay blood money if he is pardoned and it is determined in advance. The Sunnah made it clear that between intentional and accidental killing there is a killing called quasi-intentional, which is that he kills him with something that does not usually kill, so there is no retaliation for it, but blood money like intentional killing in the description and accidental killing in the postponement and the pregnancy, and intentional killing is more deserving of expiation than accidental killing.
j-0191	And it was revealed when a group of the Companions passed by a man from Banu Salim while he was driving sheep and he greeted them, and they said he did not greet us except out of caution, so they killed him and drove away his sheep. “O you who believe, when you strike” when you travel for jihad “in the cause of Allah, verify” and in another reading it is “verify” in both places “and do not say to one who offers you peace” with an alif or without it, meaning greeting or submission with the word of testimony which is a sign of Islam “you are not a believer” and you only said this out of caution for yourself and your wealth, so they killed him “seeking” you seek for that “the goods of worldly life” its enjoyment from the spoils “but with Allah are abundant spoils” that suffice you from killing someone like him for his wealth “thus were you before” your blood and wealth are protected by simply saying the testimony “but Allah has conferred favor upon you” by becoming famous and by faith and uprightness “so verify” that you do not kill a believer and do to the one who enters Islam as He did to you “for Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted” so He will reward you for it.
j-0192	“Not equal are those of the believers who sit (at home)” from jihad “except those who are disabled” in the nominative case and the accusative case is an exception from time or blindness and the like “and those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred those who strive with their wealth and their lives over those who sit (at home)” due to disadvantage “in degree” as a virtue because they are equal in intention and the mujahidin are more active “and to each” of the two groups “Allah has promised the best” Paradise “and Allah has preferred those who strive over those who sit (at home)” due to no disadvantage “a great reward” and it is substituted for it “degrees from Him” stations, some above others, “and forgiveness and mercy” in the accusative case with their implied verb “and Allah is Forgiving” to His friends “and Merciful” to the people of His obedience and it was revealed about a group who converted to Islam but did not emigrate and were killed on the day of Badr with the infidels
j-0193	"“Those whom the angels take while they are wronging themselves” by staying with the disbelievers and not emigrating “they will say” to them, rebuking them “in what were you” that is, in what were you in the matter of your religion “they will say” apologizing “we were weak” unable to establish the religion “in the land” the land of Mecca “they will say” to them, rebuking them “was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein” from the land of disbelief to another country as others did? God Almighty said “for those, their refuge is Hell, and evil it is as a destination” it is “except for the weak among men, women and children” who “are unable to devise a plan” they have no strength to emigrate or provide for “nor are they shown a way” a path to the land of emigration
“for those it is possible that Allah will pardon them, and Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.” “And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many [alternative] locations” emigrating “and abundance” in provision “and whoever leaves his home, emigrating for the sake of Allah and His Messenger, then death overtakes him” on the way as happened to Junda’ bin Damrah Al-Laithi: “It has happened.” It has been proven. “His reward is with God, and God is Forgiving and Merciful.”"
j-0194	“And when you travel” travel “throughout the land, there is no blame upon you” for “shortening the prayer” by reducing it from four to two “if you fear that those who disbelieve may tempt you” that is, harm you “by those who disbelieve” is a statement of the reality at that time, so it has no meaning. The Sunnah has made clear that what is meant by a long journey is four days, which are two stages. It is understood from the Almighty’s saying “there is no blame upon you” that it is a dispensation, not an obligation, and Al-Shafi’i agreed with this. “Indeed, the disbelievers are to you a clear enemy” clear enmity. “And when you” O Muhammad, are present “among them” and you fear the enemy “and lead them in prayer” this is in accordance with the Qur’an’s custom in addressing them “then let a party of them stand with you” and let a party stay behind “and let them take” that is, the party that stood with you “their weapons” with them “and when they prostrate” that is, pray “then let them” that is, the other party “be behind you” guard until you finish the prayer and this party goes to guard “and let another party come who have not prayed, let them pray with you and let them take their precautions.” And their weapons” with them until they complete the prayer. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, did the same in Batn Nakhl. It was narrated by the two sheikhs. “Those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect” when you stand up for prayer “your weapons and your baggage so that they could attack you with a single attack” by attacking you and seizing you. This is the reason for the command to take weapons. “And there is no blame upon you if you are troubled by rain or you are ill if you lay down your weapons” so do not carry them. This restricts the obligation to carry them when there is no excuse. This is one of two opinions of al-Shafi’i. The second is that it is a Sunnah and is preferred. “And take your precautions” from the enemy, meaning guard against him as much as you can. “Indeed, God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment” of humiliation. “So when you have completed the prayer” you have finished it “then remember God” by glorifying and praising Him “standing and sitting and [lying] on your sides” lying down, meaning in every situation. “And when you are secure” you are safe “then establish prayer” perform it with its rights. “Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree” written and imposed “with specified times” meaning its time is determined, so do not delay it. On his authority, it was revealed when the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, sent a group in pursuit of Abu Sufyan and his companions when they returned from Uhud and complained of wounds.
j-0195	“And do not weaken” weaken “in seeking” seeking “the people” the infidels so that you may fight them “if you are suffering” if you are feeling the pain of wounds “they are suffering as you are suffering” that is, like you and they are not cowardly in fighting you “and you expect” you “from God” victory and reward for it “that which they do not expect” so you increase them in that and you should be more desirous of it than they are “and God is Knowing” of everything “and Wise” in His creation.
j-0196	And Ta'mah ibn Ubayraq stole a shield and hid it with a Jew, and it was found with him. Ta'mah threw it at him and swore that he had not stolen it. So his people asked the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, to argue on his behalf and acquit him, so the following was revealed: “Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book” the Qur’an “in truth” related to “sent down” “so that you may judge between the people by what God has shown you” in it “and be not an advocate for the deceitful” like Ta'mah “an advocate on their behalf”
j-0197	"""And seek forgiveness from Allah"" for what you intended to do ""for Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" ""And do not argue on behalf of those who betray themselves"" who betray themselves by committing sins because the consequences of their betrayal are upon them ""for Allah does not like anyone who is a traitor"" who frequently betrays ""and sinful"" that is, He punishes him ""who hide"" that is, Ta'mah and his people out of shyness ""from the people and do not hide from Allah, and He is with them"" with His knowledge ""when they spend the night"" they conceal ""that which does not please Him of speech"" of their intention to swear to deny the theft and accuse the Jew of it ""and Allah is encompassing of what they do"" with knowledge
""Here you are"" O ""those"" addressing Ta'mah's people ""you have argued"" you have disputed ""on their behalf"" that is, on Ta'mah and his relatives, and it was read from him ""in the life of this world. So who will argue with Allah on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection"" when He punishes them ""or who will be a guardian over them"" who will take charge of their affairs and defend them, that is, no one will do that"
j-0198	“And whoever does evil” a sin that harms another, such as throwing food at a Jew “or wrongs himself” commits a minor sin “and then seeks forgiveness from Allah” for it, that is, repents “he will find Allah Forgiving” to him “and Merciful” to him. “And whoever earns a sin” a sin “he only earns it against himself” because its consequences are upon him and does not harm others “and Allah is Knowing and Wise” in His creation. “And whoever earns a sin” a small sin “or a major sin “and then attributes it to one who is innocent” of it “has certainly borne” bears “slander” by his accusation “and a manifest sin” manifest by his earning it
j-0199	“And had it not been for the grace of God upon you,” O Muhammad, “and His mercy,” in His protection, “a party of them,” from the people of Ta’mah, “would have resolved,” I implied, “to mislead you,” from judging with truth by deceiving you. “But they mislead none but themselves, and they do not harm you at all,” because the consequences of their misleading them are upon them. “And God has sent down upon you the Book,” the Qur’an, “and wisdom,” what is in it of rulings, “and taught you that which you did not know,” of rulings and the unseen. “And ever has God’s grace upon you,” in that and other things, “been great.”
j-0200	“There is no good in much of their private conversation,” that is, people, that is, what they whisper and talk about, “except” private conversation “for one who enjoins charity or righteousness,” righteous deeds, “or conciliation between people. And whoever does that,” mentioned, “seeks,” seeking “the pleasure of Allah,” and nothing else of worldly matters, “We will give him,” with the letters “nun” and “ya,” that is, Allah, “a great reward.” “And whoever contradicts,” opposes, “the Messenger” in what he brought of the truth, “after guidance has become clear to him,” the truth has become clear to him through miracles, “and follows” a path “other than the way of the believers,” that is, their path that they are on of religion, by disbelief, “We will give him what he has taken,” We will make him a guardian of what he has taken of misguidance by leaving him alone with it in this world, “and drive him,” We will admit him in the Hereafter, “into Hell,” so that he will burn therein, “and evil it is as a destination,” a return place.
j-0201	“God does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with God has certainly strayed far astray.”
j-0202	"“Indeed, what they invoke” the polytheists worship “besides Him” that is, God, that is, other than Him, “is only females” feminine idols such as al-Lat, al-Uzza, and Manat. “And indeed, what they invoke” they worship by worshipping them “is only a rebellious devil” who has gone against obedience to them because of their obedience to him in it, and he is Iblis. “May God curse him” He distanced him from His mercy. “And he said” that is, the devil “I will surely take” I will make for myself “of Your servants a portion” a share “determined” cut off, calling them to obey me. “And I will mislead them” from the truth by whispering “and I will arouse in them false hopes” I will cast into their hearts the length of life and that there will be no resurrection or reckoning. “And I will command them to cut off” they will cut off “the ears of cattle” and He did that with the lakes. “And I will command them to change the creation of God” His religion by disbelief and making lawful what God has forbidden and forbidding what He has made lawful. “And whoever takes Satan as a friend” who befriends him and obeys him “besides God” that is, other than Him, “has certainly lost.” ""A manifest loss"" He clearly states his fate in the eternal fire upon him. ""He promises them"" a long life ""and gives them false hope"" of attaining their hopes in this world and no resurrection or reward. ""But Satan promises them"" of that ""nothing but delusion"" falsely. ""Their refuge is Hell, and they will find no escape from it"" equal."
j-0203	“And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. The promise of Allah is true.” That is, Allah’s promise to them is true. “And who” that is, no one “is more truthful than Allah in statement?” That is, no one “is more truthful than Allah in statement.” This was revealed when the Muslims and the People of the Book boasted. “It is not” the matter is dependent “on your desires or the desires of the People of the Book” but rather on righteous deeds. “Whoever does evil will be recompensed for it” either in the Hereafter or in this world with affliction and trials, as mentioned in the hadith. “And he will not find for himself besides Allah” that is, other than Him “a protector” to protect him “or a helper” to prevent him from it. “And whoever does” anything “of righteous deeds, whether male or female, while he is a believer - those will enter” in the passive and active form “Paradise and they will not be wronged, even as much as a date stone.” “And who” that is, no one “is better in religion than one who submits his face” that is, submits and dedicates his work “to Allah while he is a doer of good” monotheist “and follows the religion of Abraham” in accordance with the religion of Islam “inclining toward the true religion” in the state of being, “and Allah took Abraham as his protector” Khalil, a sincere friend, pure in his love for Him. “To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth,” as kings, creation, and servants. “And God is encompassing of all things,” in knowledge and power, meaning that He has always been characterized by that.
j-0204	“And they ask you for a legal opinion” they ask you for a legal opinion “concerning” the matter of “women” and their inheritance. “Say” to them “Allah gives you a legal opinion concerning them and what is recited to you in the Book” the Qur’an from the verse on inheritance. He also gives you a legal opinion “concerning orphan women to whom you do not give what has been prescribed” for them, of inheritance, “and you desire” O guardians “to marry them” because of their ugliness and you prevent them from marrying out of desire for their inheritance, that is, He gives you a legal opinion not to do that “and” concerning “the weak” the young “and among the children” to give them their rights “and” He commands you “to act justly towards the orphans” with justice in inheritance and dowry “and whatever good you do - indeed, Allah is ever Knowing of it” so He will reward you for it.
j-0205	"""And if a woman fears"" raised by a verb that explains it ""from her husband"" her husband ""contempt"" showing arrogance towards her by not sleeping with her and being short in providing for her because of his hatred for her and his desire for something more beautiful than her ""or turning away"" from her with his face ""there is no blame upon them if they make peace"" in this is the assimilation of the ta' in the original into the sa'd and in the reading it is yasehu from aslah ""between them by settlement"" in the division and the provision by leaving him something in order to maintain the friendship. If she is satisfied with that, then if not, then the husband must fulfill her right or leave her ""and settlement is better"" than separation, rebellion and turning away. God Almighty said in explaining what man is naturally inclined towards ""and souls have brought forth greed"" intense stinginess, meaning they are naturally inclined towards it so it is as if it is present in him and never disappears from him. The meaning is that a woman can hardly allow her share from her husband and a man can hardly allow himself to be with her if he loves someone else ""and if you treat women well"" and fear"" injustice towards them ""then indeed Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted"" so He will reward you for it. ""And you will never be able to be just"" “Be equal between women” in love “even if you should strive to do so.” “But do not incline completely” to the one you love in terms of the portion of money and expenditure “leaving her” that is, abandoning all your wealth from her “as one in suspense” who is neither widowed nor married. “But if you make peace” in terms of justice and division “and fear” injustice “then indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving” of what is in your heart of inclination “and Merciful” to you in that. “And if they separate” that is, the spouses by divorce “Allah will enrich each” from his companion “from His bounty” that is, His grace by providing her with a husband other than him and him with another. “And ever is Allah Bountiful” to His creation in grace “and Wise” in what He has planned for them."
j-0206	“To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And We have already enjoined upon those who were given the Scripture before you,” meaning the Scriptures, “and upon you,” O People of the Qur’an, “that,” meaning, “fear God,” fear His punishment by obeying Him. “And,” We said to them and to you, “If you disbelieve,” in what you have been enjoined, “then to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth,” creation, dominion, and servants, so your disbelief will not harm Him. “And God is free from need,” of His creation and their worship, “Praiseworthy,” praised in His work with them. “And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth,” He repeated it to emphasize the necessity of piety. “And sufficient is God as Disposer of affairs,” as a witness that what is in them belongs to Him. “If He wills, He can take you away,” O “people, and bring others,” in your place. “And God is ever competent to do that.” “Whoever desires,” with his actions, “the reward of this world,” “then with God is the reward of this world and the Hereafter,” for whoever desires it, not with anyone else. So none of you would seek the worse, and why would he seek the higher by being sincere to Him? Where his request was not found except with Him, “And God is All-Hearing, All-Seeing.”
j-0207	“O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if the testimony is against yourselves, so bear witness against it by acknowledging the truth and not concealing it, or against parents and relatives. If the one being testified against is rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of them both, than you and knows best what is in their best interests. So follow not [your own] inclination in your testimony, by loving the rich for His pleasure or the poor out of mercy for him, lest you deviate from the truth. And if you distort the testimony, or turn away, then indeed, Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted,” so He will reward you for it. “O you who have believed, believe,” persist in believing, “in Allah and His Messenger and the Book which He sent down upon His Messenger,” Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, which is the Qur’an, “and the Book which He sent down before,” upon the messengers, meaning the books, and in a reading with the subject construction in both verbs, “and whoever disbelieves in Allah and His angels, And His books, His messengers, and the Last Day, he has gone far astray from the truth.
j-0208	“Indeed, those who believed” in Moses, that is, the Jews, “then disbelieved” in their worship of the calf, “then believed” after him, “then disbelieved” in Jesus, “then increased in disbelief” in Muhammad, “God will never forgive them” what they persisted in, “nor will He guide them to a way” a path to the truth. “Promise” O Muhammad, “to the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment” painful, which is the punishment of the Fire. “Those” a substitute or description of the hypocrites, “take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers” because of what they imagine to be their strength. “Do they seek” they seek “with them honor?” A question of denial, meaning they do not find it with them. “For indeed, honor belongs to God entirely” in this world and the Hereafter, and none attain it except His allies.
j-0209	“And it has been revealed” in the active and passive form “upon you in the Book” the Qur’an in Surat Al-An’am “that” lightened and its subject is omitted, meaning that “when you hear the verses of Allah” the Qur’an “being denied and ridiculed, then do not sit with them” meaning the disbelievers and the mockers “until they engage in a different conversation. Indeed, if you” if you sit with them “you will be like them” in sin “for Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers in Hell all together” as they gathered in this world in disbelief and mockery “who” in place of those before it “lie in wait” wait “for you” the circles “so if you have a victory” triumph and spoils “from Allah they will say” to you “were we not with you” in religion and jihad, so give us from the spoils “and if the disbelievers have a share” of the victory over you “they will say” to them “did we not gain control” do we seize “over you” and were able to seize you and kill you, so we spared you “and did we not protect you from the believers” If they succeed in defeating you by discouraging you and sending you messages about them, then we have a favor upon you. God Almighty said, “Then God will judge between you” and them “on the Day of Resurrection” by admitting you into Paradise and admitting them into Hell. “And God will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers.” A way by extermination. “The hypocrites seek to deceive God” by showing the opposite of what they concealed of disbelief in order to repel His worldly rulings from them. “And He is the One who deceives them.” He will reward them for their deception, so they will be disgraced in this world by God informing His Prophet of what they concealed, and they will be punished in the Hereafter. “And when they stand up for prayer” with the believers, “they stand up lazily,” sluggishly, “showing off to the people” with their prayer “and they do not remember God” they pray “except a little,” hypocritically. “Wavering,” hesitating, “between that” disbelief and faith “neither” attributed “to these” meaning the disbelievers “nor to those” meaning the believers. “And he whom God sends astray, you will never find for him a way” a way to guidance.
j-0210	“O you who have believed, do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do you wish to make for Allah over you a clear authority?” “Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire.” That is, its bottom. “And never will you find for them a helper.”
j-0211	"“Except for those who repent” from hypocrisy “and amend” their actions “and hold fast” and trust “in God and devote their religion to God” from showing off “they will be with the believers” in what they are given “and God will give the believers a great reward” in the Hereafter, which is Paradise
“What would God do with your punishment if you are grateful” for His blessings “and believe” in Him? The question is in the sense of negation, meaning He will not punish you “and God is ever Appreciative” for the actions of the believers with reward “and Knowing” of His creation"
j-0212	“Allah does not like the public mention of evil speech” from anyone, that is, He punishes him for it “except for one who has been wronged” so He does not punish him for publicizing it by telling about the wrong of his wrongdoer and calling down curses upon him “and Allah is Hearing” of what is said “Knowing” of what is done “whether you disclose” show “good” of righteous deeds “or conceal it” do it secretly “or pardon an evil” of wrongdoing “then indeed Allah is Pardoning and Powerful.”
j-0213	"“Those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His messengers” by believing in Him without them “and say, ‘We believe in some’ of the messengers “and disbelieve in others’” of them “and wish to adopt a way between that” disbelief and belief “and a path” to which they go
“Those are the disbelievers in truth” a source confirming the content of the sentence before it “and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment” of humiliation, which is the punishment of the Fire
“And those who believe in Allah and His messengers” all of them “and make no distinction between any of them - those will be given” with the letter ya and the letter nun “their reward” the reward for their deeds “and Allah is ever Forgiving” to His friends “and Merciful” to those who obey Him"
j-0214	“The People of the Book ask you, O Muhammad, that you bring down to them a book from the heaven,” just as it was sent down to Moses, as a challenge. If you are arrogant about that, “they asked,” that is, their fathers, “of Moses something greater,” greater, “than that, and they said, ‘Show us Allah openly,’” clearly, “so the thunderbolt seized them,” death as a punishment for them, “for their wrongdoing,” when they were stubborn in asking, “then they took the calf,” as a god, “after the clear proofs had come to them,” the miracles of Allah’s oneness, “so We pardoned that,” and did not eradicate them, “and We gave Moses a clear authority,” a clear and apparent authority over them, when He commanded them to kill themselves in repentance, so they obeyed him. “And We raised above them the Mount,” the mountain, “with their covenant,” because of taking the covenant from them so that they would fear, so they accepted it, “and We said to them,” while it was overshadowing them, “Enter the gate,” the gate of the village, “prostrating,” a prostration of bowing, “and We said to them, ‘Do not transgress,’” and in a reading with the ‘ayn open and the dal doubled, and in it the ta’ in the original is assimilated into the dal, meaning Do not transgress “on the Sabbath” by hunting whales on it “and We took from them a solemn covenant” on that, but they broke it. “Because of their breaking” “ma” is redundant and the ba’ is for causality and related to something omitted, that is, We cursed them because of their breaking “their covenant and their disbelief in the signs of Allah and their killing of the prophets without right and their saying” to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, “our hearts are covered” they do not comprehend your words “rather Allah has sealed” they are sealed “because of their disbelief” so they do not comprehend an admonition “so they do not believe except a few” of them like Abdullah ibn Salam and his companions. “And because of their disbelief” secondly in Jesus and the ba’ is repeated to separate it from what it is connected to “and their saying” boasting “Indeed, we killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah” in their claim, that is, because of all of that, We punished them. Allah the Most High said, denying them for killing him “but they killed him not nor crucified him, but it was made to appear to them” the one killed and crucified, who is their companion, to Jesus, that is God cast a likeness upon him, so they thought he was him. “And indeed, those who differ concerning him” that is, concerning Jesus “are in doubt concerning him” about his killing, as some of them said when they saw the one killed, the face was the face of Jesus and the body was not his body, so it was not him. Others said, “Rather, it was him.” “They have no knowledge of it” about his killing “except the following of conjecture” a discontinuous exception, that is, but they follow the conjecture they imagined. “And they did not kill him for certain” a state of confirmation that negates killing. “Rather, God raised him up to Himself, and God is Exalted in Might” in His kingdom, “Wise” in His creation. “And there is none among the People of the Scripture” one “but that he will believe in him” Jesus “before his death” that is, the People of the Scripture when they see the angels of death, so their belief will not benefit them, or before the death of Jesus when they descend near the Hour, as mentioned in the hadith. “And on the Day of Resurrection he” Jesus “will be a witness” to what they did when he was sent to them. “Then because of the wrongdoing” that is, because of the wrongdoing “of those who were Jews” they are the Jews “We forbade them good things that had been lawful to them” from that which is in the verse of God Almighty, We forbade every animal with claws, the verse. “And because they turn away” people “from the way of God” His religion, “much” “and because they take interest, although they were forbidden from it” in the Torah “and because they consume people’s wealth unjustly” by bribery in judgment “and We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment” painful
j-0215	“But those who are firm in knowledge among them” like Abdullah bin Salam “and the believers” the Muhajireen and Ansar “believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you” of the books “and those who establish prayer” in the accusative case for praise and it was read in the nominative case “and those who give zakat and those who believe in God and the Last Day - those We will give” with the letter noon and the letter ya “a great reward” which is Paradise.
j-0216	“Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], just as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him, and just as We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, his two sons, and Jacob, the son of Isaac, and the tribes, his sons, and Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. And We gave to David the Psalms, and We sent messengers We have mentioned to you before, and messengers We have not mentioned to you.” It was narrated that God Almighty sent eight thousand prophets, four thousand from Israel and four thousand from other people. The Sheikh said this in Surat Ghafir. “And God spoke to Moses,” without an intermediary, “speaking” “messengers” instead of messengers before him, “bringing good tidings” of reward for those who believe, “and warning” of punishment for those who disbelieve. We sent them “so that mankind will have no argument against God” it is said “after” sending “the messengers” to them, so they will say, “Our Lord, if only You had sent to us a messenger so we could follow Your signs and be among the believers.” So We sent them to cut off their excuse. “And God is Exalted in Might” in His kingdom “and Wise” in His creation. And it was revealed when the Jews were asked about his prophethood, may God bless him and grant him peace, and they denied it. “But God bears witness” to what He has revealed to you, of the miraculous Qur’an. “He has revealed it” ambiguously “with His knowledge” that is, knowing it or in it is His knowledge. “And the angels bear witness” to you also. “And sufficient is God as Witness” to that.
j-0217	“Indeed, those who disbelieve” in God “and avert” people “from the way of God” the religion of Islam by concealing the description of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and they are the Jews “have certainly strayed far” from the truth. “Indeed, those who disbelieve” in God “and wronged” His Prophet by concealing his description, “God will never forgive them nor guide them to a way” of the ways “except the way of Hell” that is, the way leading to it, “abiding” destined to remain “therein” if they enter it “forever. And that, for God, is easy.”
j-0218	“O mankind,” that is, the people of Mecca, “there has come to you the Messenger,” Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “with the truth from your Lord, so believe,” in him and intend “it is better for you,” than what you are in. “But if you disbelieve,” in him, “then to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth,” in the kingdom, creation, and servants, so your disbelief will not harm Him. “And God is Knowing,” of His creation, “Wise,” in what He does with them.
j-0219	“O People of the Book,” the Gospel, “do not go to extremes in your religion and do not say about God except the true statement,” of His being free from having a partner or a son. “The Messiah, Jesus, son of Mary, was only a messenger of God and His Word which He cast,” God sent it, “to Mary and a spirit,” that is, one with a spirit, “from Him,” attributed to Him, the Most High, to honor him, and not as you claimed, the son of God or a god with Him or the third of three, because the one with a spirit is composed, and the god is free from being composed and from attributing the composite to Him. “So believe in God and His messengers and do not say,” the gods, “There are three,” God, Jesus, and his mother. “Desist,” from that and do “what is better for you,” which is monotheism. “God is only one God. Glory be to Him,” freeing Him from “having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth,” creation, dominion, and servants. And dominion contradicts prophethood. “And sufficient is God as Disposer of affairs,” as a witness to that. “The Messiah,” whom you claimed was a god, will not disdain, will be arrogant and disdain, “to be a servant of God, nor will the angels.” “Those who are close to God do not disdain to be servants.” This is one of the best digressions mentioned in response to those who claimed that they are gods or daughters of God, just as he responded before to the Christians who claimed that the intended address was to them. “And whoever disdains His worship and is arrogant, He will gather them all together to Himself” in the Hereafter.
j-0220	“As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, He will pay them their rewards in full and increase them from His bounty.” What no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no human heart has imagined. “But as for those who disdain and are arrogant,” from worshipping Him, “He will punish them with a painful punishment,” a painful punishment, which is the punishment of the Fire. “And they will not find for themselves besides Allah,” that is, other than Him, “a protector,” to repel Him from them, “or a helper,” to prevent Him from them. “O mankind, there has come to you a proof,” an argument, “from your Lord,” to you, that is, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, “and We have sent down to you a clear light,” that is, the Qur’an. “As for those who believe in Allah and hold fast to Him, He will admit them to mercy from Him and bounty and guide them to Him by a straight path,” that is, the religion of Islam.
j-0221	“They ask you” concerning kalalah. “Say: ‘Allah gives you a legal opinion concerning kalalah. If a man dies, leaving no child, and he has a sister, from both parents or a father, “she shall have half of what he leaves, and he” that is, the brother, “shall inherit from her” all of what she leaves. “If she has no child,” if she has a male child, he shall have nothing, or a female child, he shall have whatever is left of her share. If the sister or brother is from the mother, his share is one-sixth, as mentioned at the beginning of the surah. “If they” that is, the sisters, “are two” that is, or more, because it was revealed concerning Jabir, who died leaving sisters, “they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves.” “If they” that is, the heirs, “brothers, both men and women, the male shall have the share of two females. Allah makes clear to you” the laws of your religion “so that” you do not “go astray. And Allah is Knowing of all things.” And from this is inheritance. The two sheikhs narrated from al-Baraa’ that it was the last verse revealed, that is, of the obligatory shares.
j-0222	“O you who have believed, fulfill your contracts,” the confirmed covenants between you and God and the people. “Lawful to you are the beast of cattle,” camels, cows, and sheep, for eating after slaughter. “Except what is recited to you,” its prohibition is in “Forbidden to you are dead animals,” the verse. So the exception is disconnected, and it is possible for it to be connected. The prohibition is for what has occurred of death and the like. “But not lawful is game while you are in a state of ihram,” meaning in a state of ihram. “Indeed, God decrees what He wills,” of lawfulness and other things. There is no objection to it. “O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of God,” the plural of rite, meaning the landmarks of His religion, by hunting during ihram, “nor the sacred month,” by fighting in it, “nor the offerings,” what is offered to the sanctuary of livestock by exposing it, “nor the necklaces,” the plural of necklace, which is what was worn from the trees of the sanctuary to secure it, meaning do not expose them or their owners, “nor” violate “the sacred house,” intending to fight them, “seek bounty,” provision, “from their Lord,” by trade. “And We have approved of him” with his intention, according to their corrupt claim, and this is abrogated by the verse of innocence. “And when you have completed your state of ihram, then hunt” a command of permission. “And let not hatred” with the opening of the noon or its sukoon, the hatred of a people for “because they prevented you from the Sacred Mosque, incite you to transgress” against them by killing or otherwise. “And cooperate in righteousness” by doing what you have been commanded to do “and piety” by abandoning what you have been forbidden from. “And do not cooperate” in it, with the deletion of one of the two ta’s in the original, “in sin” disobedience “and aggression” transgression within the limits of God. “And fear God” fear His punishment by obeying Him. “Indeed, God is severe in penalty” for whoever disobeys Him.
j-0223	“Forbidden to you are dead animals” that is, eating them “and blood” that is, spilled as in livestock “and the flesh of swine and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah” by slaughtering in the name of someone else “and the strangled” that which died by strangulation “and the beaten” that which was killed by being beaten “and the one who falls” that which fell from a height to a lower level and died “and the one who was gored” that which was killed by another goring it “and that which a wild animal has eaten” of it “except what you slaughter” that is, you have found the soul in it from these things and slaughtered it “and that which was slaughtered on” the name of “al-sub” the plural of “al-sub” which are idols “and that you seek to divide” to ask for division and judgment “with arrows” the plural of “zalam” with a fatha on the zay and a damma on the lam, a small cup with no feathers or blade, and there were seven with the custodian of the Kaaba on which were flags and they used to rule over it. If you commanded them, they obeyed, and if you forbade them, they desisted. “That is transgression” that is a departure from obedience and it was revealed on the Day of Arafah in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage. “Today those who disbelieved have despaired of [devoting] to your religion” that you would turn away from it after Their greed for that when they saw its strength, “So do not fear them, but fear Me. This day I have perfected for you your religion,” its rulings and obligations, after which nothing permissible or forbidden was revealed, “and completed My favor upon you,” by completing it, and it was said by entering Mecca in safety, “and have chosen for you Islam as religion. So whoever is forced by severe hunger, without inclining toward sin, disobedience, “then indeed, Allah is Forgiving,” of what he ate, “Merciful,” to him in permitting him, unlike one who is inclined toward sin, that is, one who is involved in it, like a highwayman or a rebel, for example, so it is not permissible for him to eat.
j-0224	“They ask you,” O Muhammad, “what is lawful for them,” of food. “Say: Lawful to you are the good things,” the delicious things, “and” the game “which you have taught of the birds of prey,” the predators of dogs, wild beasts, and birds, “training them,” a state of “qalbāt al-kalb” with emphasis, meaning you send it out to hunt. “You teach them,” a state of the pronoun “mukalbiyn,” meaning you discipline them, “from what Allah has taught you,” of the etiquette of hunting. “So eat of what they catch for you,” even if you kill it, by not eating from it, unlike the untrained ones, whose hunting is not lawful. Its sign is that it is released when it is sent, and is deterred when deterred, and holds the game and does not eat from it. The minimum that it is known for is three times. If it eats from it, it is not from what they caught for its owner, so it is not lawful to eat it, as in the hadith of the two Sahihs, in which it says that the hunting of an arrow if it is released and the name of Allah is mentioned over it is like the hunting of trained birds of prey. “And mention the name of Allah over it,” when it is released, “and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is swift in account.” “Today, lawful for you are the good things,” the delicious things, “and the food of those who were given the Scripture,” meaning the slaughtered animals of the Jews and Christians. “It is lawful,” permissible, “for you.” And your food is lawful for them, and chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, if you have given them their dowries, chaste, married, not fornicators, not openly committing adultery with them, nor taking secret lovers, from among them, and whoever disbelieves in the faith, that is, apostatizes, his work has become worthless, his good deeds before that, so they are not taken into account and he will not be rewarded for them, and in the Hereafter he will be among the losers, if he dies in that state.
j-0225	“O you who have believed, when you rise to prayer, wash your faces and your forearms up to the elbows, as the Sunnah has explained. “And wipe over your heads, and your feet, up to the ankles, as the Sunnah has explained. And if you are in a state of major ritual impurity, then purify yourselves, and if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes from the privy, or has not touched women, or if you find no water, or if you have not sought it.” “Then perform tayammum” means “clean earth” pure soil “and wipe your faces and your hands” including the elbows “with it” with two strokes, and the “ba” is for attachment, and the Sunnah clarifies that what is meant is to include both limbs in the wiping. “Allah does not intend to place upon you any difficulty” hardship by what He has imposed upon you of ablution, ritual washing, and tayammum “but He intends to purify you” from ritual impurities and sins “and to complete His favor upon you” with Islam by explaining the laws of the religion “that you may be grateful” for His favors.
j-0226	“And remember the favor of Allah upon you” with Islam “and His covenant” His pledge “with which He bound you” He made a covenant with you “when you said” to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, when you pledged allegiance to him “We hear and we obey” in everything he commands and forbids, which we like and dislike “and fear Allah” in His covenant that you break it “for Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts” what is in the hearts, so it is more appropriate to do otherwise “O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah” His rights “witnesses in justice” with fairness “and do not let” hatred” of “a people” that is, the disbelievers “incite you not to be just” so that you do not take revenge on them for their enmity “be just” with regard to the enemy and the friend “it” that is, justice “is nearer to righteousness and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do” so He will reward you for it
j-0227	“God has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds” a good promise “for them is forgiveness and a great reward” which is Paradise. “But those who disbelieve and deny Our signs - those are the companions of Hellfire.”
j-0228	“O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when a people” they are the Quraysh “wanted to stretch out their hands against you” to kill you “but He restrained their hands from you” and protected you from what they intended to do to you “and fear Allah, and upon Allah let the believers put their trust.”
j-0229	“And God took a covenant from the Children of Israel,” as mentioned later, “and We raised up” in it a shift from the third person, “We established” “from among them twelve leaders” from each tribe a leader who would be responsible for his people in fulfilling the covenant, as a guarantee for them. “And God said” to them, “Indeed, I am with you” with aid and support. “If” the lam of an oath “you establish prayer and give zakah and believe in My messengers and support them” support them “and lend God a goodly loan” by spending in His cause “I will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever disbelieves after that” the covenant “among you has certainly strayed from the right path” he has strayed from the right path. The right path is originally the middle way, so they broke the covenant. God Almighty said: “Because of their breaking” the ma is redundant “of their covenant, We cursed them” We distanced them from Our mercy “and made their hearts hard” they do not soften to accept faith. “They distort the words” in the Torah of the description of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and others. “From its places” which God has placed it in, that is, they change it, “and they have forgotten” they have left “a portion” a share “of what they were reminded of” they were commanded “to do” in the Torah, of following Muhammad. “And you will not cease” addressing the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “to see” reveal “betrayal” that is, treachery “from them” by breaking the covenant and other things “except a few of them” of those who have submitted, “so pardon them and overlook. Indeed, God loves the doers of good.” This was abrogated by the verse of the sword.
j-0230	“And among those who said, ‘We are Christians,’” is related to His statement, “We took their covenant,” just as We took it from the Children of Israel, the Jews, “but they forgot a portion of what they were reminded of,” in the Gospel of faith and other things, and they broke the covenant, “so We stirred up,” We caused “among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection,” through their division and the difference in their desires, so that each group would disbelieve in the other, “and God will inform them,” in the Hereafter, “about what they used to do,” and He will punish them for it.
j-0231	«O People of the Book» Jews and Christians «There has come to you Our Messenger» Muhammad «making clear to you much of what you used to conceal» conceal «of the Book» the Torah and the Gospel, such as the verse of stoning and its description «and pardoning much» of that, but he does not make it clear if there is no benefit in it except your disgrace «There has come to you from Allah a light» he is the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace «and a clear Book» the Qur’an «by which» that is, by the Book «Allah guides whoever pursues His pleasure» by believing «to the ways of peace» the paths of safety «and brings them out from darkness» disbelief «into the light» faith «by His permission» by His will «and guides them to a straight path» the religion of Islam «Indeed, they have disbelieved who say, “Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary” since they made him a god, and they are the Jacobites, a group of Christians «Say, “Who has the power” that is, to repel «anything from» the punishment «of Allah if He wills to destroy the Messiah, the son of Mary, and his mother, and everyone on the earth entirely» that is, no one has the power to do so, and if the Messiah were a god, He would have been able to do so «and to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything between them. He creates what He wills, and God is over all things competent.
j-0232	“And the Jews and the Christians say,” that is, each of them, “We are the children of God,” that is, like His children in closeness and status, and He is like our father in mercy and compassion, “and His beloved ones.” Say, O Muhammad, “Then He has not punished you for your sins,” if you are truthful in that, and a father does not punish his son, nor a beloved his beloved, and He has punished you, so you are liars. “Rather, you are human beings from among those” from among those “He created.” You have what they have and you are subject to what they are subject to. “He forgives whom He wills,” forgiveness is for him, “and punishes whom He wills,” there is no objection to His punishment. “And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, and to Him is the final destination.” The reference is to “O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger,” Muhammad, “making clear to you,” the laws of the religion, “after a period,” an interruption, “of messengers,” since there was no messenger between him and Jesus, and the period of that was five hundred and sixty-nine years, “so that” “you do not say,” if you are punished, “There has not come to us any,” an extra “bringer of good tidings or a warner,” but there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner,” so you have no excuse, “and God is over all things competent.” And from it, your torture if you do not follow it
j-0233	"«And» remember «when Moses said to his people, ""O my people, remember the favor of God upon you when He made among you"" that is, from you ""prophets and made you kings"" with servants and attendants ""and gave you that which He had not given to anyone in the worlds"" of manna and quails and splitting the sea and other things. «O my people, enter the Holy Land"" the purified ""which God has ordained for you"" He ordered you to enter it, which is Syria ""and do not turn back"" fleeing in fear of the enemy ""and become losers"" in your efforts. «They said, ""O Moses, indeed within it is a people of giants"" from the remnants of the tall and powerful Ad ""and we will never enter it until they leave it. If they leave it, then we will enter"" it. «He said» to them, «Two men from among those who feared"" disobeying God's command, and they were Joshua and Caleb, two of the leaders whom Moses sent to uncover the conditions of the giants ""God has favored them"" with infallibility, so they concealed what they learned of their condition except from Moses, unlike the rest of the leaders, who divulged it and became cowards. ""Enter upon them through the gate,"" the gate of the village, and do not fear them, for they are bodies without hearts. ""And when you have entered it, you will be victorious."" They said that, certain of God's victory and the fulfillment of His promise. ""And upon God rely, if you should be believers."" They said, ""O Moses, we will never enter it as long as they are within it. So go, you and your Lord, and fight."" They, ""Indeed, we are sitting here,"" from fighting. ""He said,"" Moses then, ""My Lord, indeed I do not control except myself and"" except ""my brother,"" and I do not control anyone else, so force them to obey. ""So separate,"" separate ""between us and the wicked people."" God Almighty said to him, ""It is forbidden for them to enter it, meaning the Holy Land, for forty years, wandering and bewildered in the land, and it is nine farsakhs."" Ibn Abbas said, ""Do not despair or grieve over the wicked people."" It was narrated that they used to travel at night, diligently, and when morning came, they were in the place from which they started, and they would travel during the day likewise until they were all extinct, except for those who had not reached twenty. It was said that they were six hundred thousand, and Aaron and Moses died in the wilderness. Mercy for them and punishment for those. Moses asked his Lord when he was dying to bring him close to the Holy Land, a stone’s throw away, so He brought him close, as in the hadith. Joshua was prophesied after forty and was ordered to fight the tyrants, so he marched with those who remained with him and fought them. It was Friday and the sun stopped for him for an hour until he finished fighting them. Ahmad narrated in his Musnad the hadith that the sun was not held back for any human being except for Joshua, for the nights he marched to the Holy House."
j-0234	"“And recite to them,” O Muhammad, “the news,” the news of “the two sons of Adam,” Abel and Cain, “in truth,” related to “recite,” “when they offered a sacrifice,” to God, a ram for Abel and a crop for Cain, “and it was accepted from one of them,” that is, Abel, by a fire descending from the sky and consuming his sacrifice, “but it was not accepted from the other,” that is, Cain, so he became angry and harbored envy in his soul until Adam performed the Hajj. “He said,” to him, “I will surely kill you,” he said, “Why?” He said, “so that your sacrifice will be accepted without me?” “He said, ‘God only accepts from the righteous.’” “If,” the lam of an oath, “you stretch out,” “your hand to kill me, I will not stretch out my hand to kill you. Indeed, I fear God, Lord of the worlds,” in killing you. “I want you to bear,” return, “my sin,” the sin of killing me, “and your sin,” which you committed before, “and be among the companions of the Fire,” and I do not want to bear your sin if I kill you, so that I will be among them. God Almighty said, “And that is the recompense of the righteous.” ""The wrongdoers""

""So his soul made him willing"" he made it seem good ""to him to kill his brother, so he killed him and became"" he became ""among the losers"" by killing him and he did not know what to do with him because he was the first dead person on the face of the earth from the sons of Adam, so he carried him on his back

""Then God sent a raven digging in the ground"" digging up dirt with its beak and feet and stirring it up on a dead raven until it covered him ""to show him how to cover"" cover ""the shame"" of his brother's corpse. He said, ""Woe to me! Am I unable"" ""to be like this raven and cover the shame"" of my brother? So he became among the regretful"" for carrying him, digging for him and burying him."
j-0235	«Because of that» what Cain did «We decreed for the Children of Israel that» that is, the matter «whoever kills a soul unless for a soul» killing it «or» without «corruption» that came to him «in the land» from disbelief or adultery or highway robbery or the like «it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves a life» by refraining from killing it «it is as if he had saved mankind entirely» Ibn Abbas said in terms of violating its sanctity and protecting it «And indeed Our messengers came to them» that is, the Children of Israel «with clear proofs» miracles «then indeed many of them after that were transgressors in the land» exceeding the limit by disbelief and murder and other things. And it was revealed about the two Arabs when they came to Medina while they were sick and the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, gave them permission to go out to the camels and drink from their urine and milk. Then when they recovered, they killed the shepherd of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and drove away the camels «The only reward of those who wage war on Allah and His Messenger» by waging war on the Muslims «and strive to cause corruption in the land» by highway robbery «is that they shall be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet shall be cut off on opposite sides» that is, Their right and left hands “or they are banished from the land” or to arrange the circumstances, so killing is for the one who killed only, crucifixion is for the one who killed and took the money, cutting off the hand for the one who took the money and did not kill, and banishment is for the one who frightened only. This was said by Ibn Abbas and Al-Shafi’i, and the most correct of his two opinions is that crucifixion is three times after the killing, and it was said a little before that, and what is similar to it in punishment is attached to the banishment, such as imprisonment and other things. “That” the mentioned punishment “is for them disgrace” humiliation “in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment” which is the punishment of the Fire. “Except for those who repent” of the warriors and bandits “before you overpower them. So know that Allah is Forgiving” of them for what they did to Him “and Merciful” He used this without “do not punish them” to indicate that nothing is dropped from him by his repentance except the limits of Allah, not the rights of humans. This is what appeared to me, and I did not see anyone who addressed it, and Allah knows best. So if he killed and took the money, he is killed and cut off and not crucified, and this is the most correct of Al-Shafi’i’s two opinions, and his repentance after being overpowered does not benefit anything, and this is the most correct of Al-Shafi’i’s two opinions, and his repentance after being overpowered does not benefit anything, and this is the most correct of his two opinions as well.
j-0236	“O you who have believed, fear Allah” fear His punishment by obeying Him “and seek” ask “the means of approach to Him” that which will bring you closer to Him through His obedience “and strive in His cause” to exalt His religion “that you may succeed” win. “Indeed, those who disbelieve, if” it were proven “they had all that is in the earth and as much more with it to ransom themselves thereby from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them, and they will have a painful punishment.” “They desire” wish “to get out of the Fire, but they will never get out of it, and they will have a lasting punishment”
j-0237	"""And the male thief, male or female"", the al in them is a relative pronoun, the subject, and because of its resemblance to a condition, the fa' was included in its predicate, which is ""cut off their hands"", meaning the right hand of each of them from the elbow. The Sunnah explained that a quarter of a dinar or more should be cut off for this, and that if he repeats it, his left foot should be cut off from the ankle joint, then his left hand, then his right foot, and after that he should be disciplined ""as a punishment"", accusative of the source, ""for what they have earned as a deterrent"", a punishment for them ""from Allah. And Allah is Exalted in Might"", dominant over His affair, ""Wise"" in His creation. ""But whoever repents after his wrongdoing"", returns from stealing ""and amends"" his actions ""then Allah will turn to him in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" In expressing this, what was mentioned above, the human being's right to amputation and the return of the money is not dropped by his repentance. Yes, the Sunnah explained that if he pardons him before referring him to the Imam, the amputation is dropped, and al-Shafi'i agreed with that. ""Do you not know"", the question in it is for confirmation, ""that Allah has dominion over the heavens and the earth. He punishes whom He wills"", his punishment ""and forgives whom He wills"", his forgiveness ""and Allah is over all things competent"", and from this is punishment And forgiveness"
j-0238	"“O Messenger, let not those who hasten into disbelief grieve you,” who fall into it quickly, that is, they show it if they find an opportunity, “of” for clarification, “those who say, ‘We believe,’ with their mouths,” with their tongues, related to “said,” “but whose hearts believe not,” and they are the hypocrites. “And of those who are Jews,” a people, “listeners to the lie,” which their rabbis have fabricated, listening to it with acceptance, “listeners,” from you, “for another people,” from the Jews, “who have not come to you,” and they are the people of Khaybar, among whom were two married men who committed adultery, so they disliked stoning them, so they sent the Qurayza to ask the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, about their ruling, “distorting the words,” which are in the Torah, such as the verse of stoning, “from their [proper] places,” which God has placed, that is, they change them, “saying,” to those who sent them, “If you are given this,” the distorted ruling, that is, the flogging that Muhammad issued a fatwa for you, “then take it,” then accept it, “but if you are not given it,” rather he issued a fatwa against it, “then beware,” from accepting it, “and whomever God desires.” His temptation” his misguidance “so you will not possess for him anything from Allah” in repelling it “those are the ones whose hearts Allah did not intend to purify” from disbelief, and if He had intended it, there would have been “for them in this world is disgrace” humiliation through scandal and tribute “and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment” They are “listeners to falsehood, devourers of unlawful gain” with a damma on the ha’ or a sukoon, meaning forbidden things such as bribes “so if they come to you” to judge between them “then judge between them or turn away from them” This choice is abrogated by the words of Allah the Most High: “And judge between them” [al-Baqarah 2:11], so it is obligatory to judge between them if they bring their case before us, and this is the more correct of the two opinions of al-Shafi’i. So if they bring their case before us with a Muslim, it is obligatory by consensus “and if you turn away from them, they will not harm you at all, and if you judge” between them “then judge between them with justice” with fairness “for Allah loves those who are just” those who are just in judgment, meaning He rewards them
“and how can they judge you while they have the Torah in which is the judgment of Allah” with stoning is an interrogative of astonishment, meaning they did not intend by that to know the truth but rather what is easier for them “and then they turn away” they turn away from your judgment By stoning in accordance with their book, “after that” the arbitration, “and those are not believers.”"
j-0239	"“Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance” from misguidance “and light” an explanation of the rulings “by which the prophets” from the Children of Israel “who submitted” submitted to God “judged for those who were Jews and the rabbis” the scholars among them “and the scholars” the jurists “for what” that is, because of what “they were entrusted” that is, entrusted to them by God “of the Book of God” lest they change it “and they were witnesses over it” that it is the truth “so fear not the people” O Jews, in revealing what you have of the description of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and stoning and other things “but fear Me” in concealing it “and do not exchange” exchange “for My verses a small price” of this world that you take in exchange for concealing it “and whoever does not judge by what God has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers” in it “and We have prescribed” imposed “upon them therein” that is, the Torah “that a life” is killed “for a life” if you kill it “and an eye” is gouged out “for an eye and a nose” is cut off “for a nose and an ear” is cut off “for an ear.” ""And the tooth"" is extracted ""for the tooth"" and in a reading with the nominative in the four ""and wounds"" in both ways ""retaliation"" that is in it if it is like the hand and the foot and the like and what is not possible for the government and this ruling even if it is written for them it is established in our law ""so whoever gives it in charity"" that is retaliation by enabling himself ""it is an expiation for him"" for what he did ""and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed"" in retaliation and other things ""then those are the wrongdoers"" ""And We followed"" we followed ""in their footsteps"" that is the prophets ""with Jesus the son of Mary, confirming what was before him"" before him ""of the Torah and We gave him the Gospel in which is guidance"" from misguidance ""and light"" an explanation of the rulings ""and confirming"" a state ""of what was before him of the Torah"" for what is in it of rulings ""and guidance and instruction for the righteous"" ""and"" We said ""that the People of the Gospel may judge by what Allah has revealed therein"" of the rulings and in a reading with the accusative of ""he judges"" and the kasra of its lam in apposition to the object of ""we gave him"" ""and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed then those are the wicked"""
j-0240	“And We have revealed to you, O Muhammad, the Book, the Qur’an, in truth, confirming what was before it, before it, of the Scripture and as a criterion, a witness, over it.” The Book means books. “So judge between them, according to what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their inclinations, justly, from what has come to you of the truth. For each of you, O nations, We prescribed a law, a law, and a method, a clear path in religion for them to follow. And if Allah had willed, He would have made you one nation, following one law, but He divided you into groups, “to test you,” to try you, “in what He has given you,” of the different laws, to see who among you is obedient and who is disobedient. “So race to [do] good deeds,” hasten to them. “To Allah is your return, all of you,” by resurrection, “and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ,” of the matter of religion, and He will reward each of you according to his deeds. “And judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their inclinations, and beware of them, lest they tempt you, lead you astray, from one another.” What God has revealed to you. But if they turn away from the revealed ruling and desire something other than it, then know that God only desires to afflict them for some of their sins in this world, and He will punish them for all of them in the Hereafter. And indeed, many people are wicked. Is it then that they seek the judgment of the time of ignorance? With the letter ya and the letter ta, they seek flattery and inclination if they turn away. This is a rhetorical question. And who is better than God in judgment for a people who are certain of Him? They were specifically mentioned because they are the ones who reflect.
j-0241	“O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies,” befriend them and show affection to them. “They are allies of one another,” do not unite with them in disbelief. “And whoever takes them as allies among you, then indeed, he is one of them,” from among them. “Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people,” by befriending the disbelievers. “Then you will see those in whose hearts is disease,” weakness of belief, like the hypocrite Abdullah ibn Ubayy, “hastening in their affairs,” in their friendship with them, “saying,” apologizing for it, “We fear that a calamity may strike us,” in which time will turn against us, such as drought or defeat, and Muhammad’s affair will not be completed, so that they will not be able to see us.” God Almighty said, “Perhaps Allah will bring about a conquest,” with victory for His Prophet by making His religion manifest, “or a decision from Him,” by exposing the veil of the hypocrites and disgracing them, “and they will become, over what they concealed within themselves,” of doubt and befriending the disbelievers, “regretful.” “And those who believe will say,” in the nominative case, resuming with “and” and without it, and in the accusative case, in apposition to “will come,” to each other when their veil is exposed, in amazement. “Are these the ones who swore by God with their most earnest oaths that they are with you?” God Almighty said, “Their good deeds have become worthless, and they have become losers, in this world through disgrace and in the Hereafter through punishment.”
j-0242	"O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion to disbelief, by separating and assimilation, returns from his religion to disbelief, informing of what Allah knows will happen. A group of people have reverted after the death of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Allah will replace them with people He loves and who love Him. He, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said: They are this people, and he pointed to Abu Musa al-Ash'ari. Al-Hakim narrated it in his Sahih: Humble, compassionate towards the believers, mighty, strong against the disbelievers. They strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic therein as the hypocrites fear the blame of the disbelievers. That is the bounty of Allah. He bestows it upon whom He wills, and Allah is all-Encompassing, abundant in bounty, Knowing of who is worthy of it. And it was revealed when Ibn Salam said: O Messenger of Allah, our people have abandoned us. ""Your ally is only Allah and His Messenger and those who believe, who establish prayer and give zakah, and they bow down"" in humility or pray voluntary prayers. ""And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and those who believe as allies"" so He helps them and supports them ""then indeed, the party of Allah - they will be the predominant"" for His support of them. He made it a statement that they are from His party, meaning His followers."
j-0243	“O you who have believed, do not take as allies those who take your religion in ridicule and amusement from among those who were given the Scripture before you and the disbelievers. And fear Allah, if you are believers, sincere in your faith. And those who, when you call to prayer, take it in ridicule and amusement, by mocking it and laughing at it. That is because they are a people who do not reason.”
j-0244	And it was revealed when the Jews said to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “Who do you believe among the messengers?” He said, “By God and what was revealed to us.” The verse was then mentioned. When Jesus was mentioned, they said, “We do not know of a religion worse than your religion.” “Say, ‘O People of the Scripture, do you blame us for anything except that we believe in God and what was revealed to us and what was revealed before, and that most of you are wicked?’” The meaning is connected to “that we believe,” meaning, “what you blame is our belief and your opposition to it in not accepting it, which is expressed by the intransitive verb, and this is not something that is denied. “Say, ‘Shall I inform you of a human being from among the people of that, whom you blame, as a reward, a reward in the sense of a penalty, from God?’ He is “whom God has cursed,” distanced him from His mercy, “and with whom He became angry and made of them apes and pigs,” by transforming them. “And from among them, the meaning of from was observed, and in what preceded it, its wording is the Jews. In a reading with a damma on the ba’ of ‘Abd and its addition to what comes after the collective noun for ‘Abd and its accusative in connection with the apes, “those are worse in position,” a distinction because Their abode is the Fire, and “and they have gone astray from the right path.” The path of truth, and the root of “right” is “middle.” Evil and “astray” are mentioned in contrast to their saying, “We do not know of a religion worse than your religion.”
j-0245	“And when they come to you,” that is, the hypocrites of the Jews, “they say, ‘We believe,’ while they have entered,” to you cloaked in “disbelief, and they have gone out,” from you cloaked in “it,” and they have not believed. “And God knows best what they were concealing,” that is, hypocrisy. “And you see many of them,” that is, the Jews, “hastening,” quickly falling “into sin,” lying, “and aggression,” injustice, “and consuming what is unlawful,” unlawful like bribes. “Evil is that which they do,” that is, their work. “Why do not,” why do the rabbis and scholars among them, “forbid them from their sinful speech,” lying, “and consuming what is unlawful? Evil is that which they do,” that is, abandoning their prohibition. “And the Jews say,” when they were made to suffer by their denial of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, after they had been the wealthiest of people, “the hand of God is chained,” restrained from providing us with sustenance. They used this as a metaphor for stinginess. God is exalted above that. God Almighty said, “Their hands are chained,” restrained, from doing good deeds, a curse upon them, “and they are cursed for what they said.” Rather, His hands are extended” is an exaggeration in describing generosity. The folded hand is used to indicate abundance, since the most that the generous person can spend from his wealth is to give with his hands. “He spends as he wills” of expansion and constriction, with no objection to it. “And what has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief” because of their disbelief in it. “And We have cast among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection.” So each group of them will oppose the other. “Whenever they kindle the fire of war” meaning to fight the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “God will extinguish it” meaning whenever they want it, He will turn them back. “And they strive to cause corruption in the land” meaning, corrupting with sins. “And God does not like corrupters” meaning that He will punish them.
j-0246	“And if the People of the Scripture had believed” in Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “and feared” disbelief, “We would have removed from them their misdeeds and admitted them to gardens of pleasure.” “And if they had upheld the Torah and the Gospel” by acting upon what is in them, including belief in the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “and what was revealed to them” of the books “they would have eaten from above them and from beneath their feet” by making provision abundant for them and flowing from every direction. “Among them is a community” a group “who are moderate” who act upon it, and they are those who believed in the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, such as Abdullah ibn Salam and his companions. “But many of them - evil” is what they do.
j-0247	O Messenger, proclaim all that has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not conceal any of it for fear that you may be harmed. And if you do not do so, that is, if you do not convey all that has been revealed to you, then you have not conveyed His message in the singular and plural, because concealing some of it is like concealing all of it. And Allah will protect you from the people lest they kill you. And the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was guarding until this was revealed, then he said, “Go away, for Allah has protected me.” Narrated by Al-Hakim. Indeed, Allah does not guide the disbelieving people. “Say, ‘O People of the Scripture, you are upon nothing’ until you uphold the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you from your Lord.’” That is, by acting upon what is in it, including belief in Me. “And what has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief.” Because of their disbelief in Him, “So do not despair” grieve “over the disbelieving people” if they do not believe in you, that is, do not worry about them. “Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews” are the subject, “and the Sabians” a group of them “and the Christians” and the subject is replaced by “whoever believes” of them “in Allah and the Last Day and does righteousness - there is no fear.” “On them, nor will they grieve.” In the Hereafter, the predicate of the subject and an indication of the predicate of “in”
j-0248	“We took a covenant from the Children of Israel” to believe in God and His messengers “and We sent to them messengers. Whenever there came to them a messenger” from among them “with what their souls did not desire” of the truth, they denied him. “A group” from among them “rejected him, and a group” from among them “killed” like Zachariah and John. The expression “killed” is used without “killed” as a narration of the past state of the comma. “And they thought” they assumed “that there would not be” in the nominative case, so “if” is lightened and the accusative is an accusative, meaning that “a trial” of torment would befall them for denying the messengers and killing them. “So they were blind” to the truth, so they did not see it, “and deaf” to hearing it. “Then God turned to them” when they repented. “Then they were blind and deaf” a second time, “many of them” instead of the pronoun. “And God is Seeing of what they do” so He will reward them for it.
j-0249	“They have certainly disbelieved who say, ‘God is the Messiah, the son of Mary.’” Something similar has already been said. “And the Messiah said, ‘O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.’” For I am a servant and not a god. “He who associates others with God, God has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are no helpers for the wrongdoers” to protect them from God’s punishment. “They have certainly disbelieved who say, ‘God is the third’ of three gods,” meaning one of them and the other two are Jesus and his mother, and they are a group of Christians. “And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they say,” of the Trinity and monotheism, “there will surely afflict those who disbelieve,” meaning persist in their disbelief, “among them is a painful punishment,” painful, which is the Fire.
j-0250	“Will they not then repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness?” for what they said, a question of reproach. “And Allah is Forgiving” to those who repent. “Merciful” to them. “The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger. Messengers have passed away before him.” He will pass away like them, and he is not a god as they claim, otherwise he would not have passed away. “And his mother was a friend” exaggerating the truth. “They used to eat food” like other people. And whoever is like that cannot be a god due to his composition and weakness and what results from him of urine and feces. “Look” in amazement “how We make clear to them the signs” of our oneness. “Then look how” how “they are turned away from the truth despite the proof being established.” “Say: Do you worship besides Allah” that is, other than Him “that which has no power to harm or benefit you? And Allah is the Hearing” of your words, “the Knowing” of your conditions. The question is for denial. “Say: O People of the Scripture” the Jews and Christians “do not exceed” do not exceed the limit “in your religion” exceed “the truth” by placing Jesus or raising him above his right. “And do not follow the inclinations of a people who have gone astray before” through their extremism, and they are their ancestors “and have led many astray” of the people “and have strayed from the right path” from the path of truth, and the right path is originally the middle way.
j-0251	“Those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel were cursed by the tongue of David” by invoking curses upon them, so they were transformed into apes, while they were the companions of Elah, “and Jesus, the son of Mary” by invoking curses upon them, so they were transformed into pigs, while they were the companions of the table. “That” the curse “was because they disobeyed and were transgressors.” “They did not forbid one another” that is, they did not forbid one another “from” repeating “the evil they did. Evil is that which they used to do” this action of theirs. “You see” O Muhammad “many of them taking as allies those who disbelieved” from the people of Mecca out of hatred for you. “Evil is that which their souls have put forward for them” of work for their afterlife that would necessitate them “that the wrath of God is upon them, and in the punishment they will abide eternally.” “And if they had believed in God and the Prophet” Muhammad “and in what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them” that is, the disbelievers “as allies, but many of them are wicked” outside of the faith.
j-0252	“You will surely find,” O Muhammad, “the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers to be the Jews and those who associate others with God,” from among the people of Mecca, due to their increasing disbelief, ignorance, and preoccupation with following their own desires. “And you will surely find the nearest of them in affection to the believers to be those who say, ‘We are Christians.’ That is because,” that is, their affection for the believers is close, “because,” because “among them are priests,” scholars, “and monks,” worshipers, “and because they are not arrogant,” from following the truth as the Jews and the people of Mecca are arrogant. It was revealed about the delegation of the Negus who came to him from Abyssinia. He recited Surat Yasin, so they wept and submitted and said, ‘How similar is this to what was revealed to Jesus.’ God Almighty said, “And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger,” from the Qur’an, “you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth. They say, ‘Our Lord, we have believed,’ we believe in Your Prophet and Your Book, ‘so register us among the witnesses,’ those who acknowledge their belief in them. ’” “And,” they said in response to those who taunted them about Islam from among the Jews, “Why should we not believe in God and what has come to us of the truth?” The Qur’an, that is, there is nothing to prevent us from believing with The existence of its requirement “and we hope” is in apposition to “we believe” “that our Lord will admit us with the righteous people” the believers in Paradise. God Almighty said: “So God rewarded them for what they said with gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the reward of the doers of good” through faith. “And those who disbelieved and denied Our signs - those are the companions of Hellfire.”
j-0253	And it was revealed when a group of the Companions intended to fast and pray at night, not to approach women, not to use perfume, not to eat meat, and not to sleep on beds: “O you who have believed, do not prohibit the good things which Allah has made lawful to you and do not transgress.” Go beyond the command of Allah. “Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors.” “And eat of what Allah has provided for you, lawful and good.” The object and the prepositional phrase before it are a state related to it. “And fear Allah, in whom you are believers.”
j-0254	“Allah will not hold you accountable for what is unintentional in your oaths,” which is what the tongue says without intending to swear, such as saying, “No, by Allah,” or “Yes, by Allah,” “but He will hold you accountable for what you have made a deliberate oath,” with emphasis and emphasis. In the reading, “you have made a deliberate deed,” “so its expiation,” that is, the oath if you break it, “is to feed ten poor people,” for each poor person, a mudd, “from the average of what you feed,” of it, “your families,” that is, to intend it and most of it, not the highest or lowest, “or to clothe them,” with what is called clothing, such as a shirt, turban, or lower garment. It is not sufficient to give what was mentioned to one poor person, and this is according to al-Shafi’i. “Or to free,” freeing “a slave,” that is, a believing woman, as in the expiation for murder and zihar, applying the general to the specific. “But whoever does not find,” one of what was mentioned, “then fasting for three days,” its expiation, and it appears that it is not a condition of succession, and this is according to al-Shafi’i. “That,” mentioned, “is the expiation for your oaths if you swear,” and break them. “And guard your oaths,” that you do not break them, unless they were on An act of righteousness or reconciliation between people, as in Surat Al-Baqarah. “Thus” meaning, just as He explained to you what He mentioned, “God makes clear to you His signs that you may be grateful.” For that.
j-0255	“O you who have believed, indeed, wine” the intoxicant that clouds the mind “and gambling” gambling “and idols” idols “and divining arrows” “are but abomination” filthy and disgusting “from the work of Satan” who beautifies it “so avoid it” that is, the abomination expressed by these things, that you do it “that you may succeed” “Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through wine and gambling” if you do them because of the evil and temptations that result from them “and to avert you” by being occupied with them “from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer” He specifically mentioned it to magnify it “so will you not desist” from doing them “and obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware” of sins “but if you turn away” from obedience “then know that upon Our Messenger is only the clear notification” the clear notification and your reward is upon Us” “there is no blame upon those who believe and do righteous deeds for what they have eaten” they ate wine and gambling before it was forbidden “when they have eaten” Fear the forbidden things, believe, and do righteous deeds. Then fear God and believe. Then fear God and do good. And God loves the doers of good. Meaning, He rewards them.
j-0256	“O you who have believed, Allah will surely test you with something” that He will send to you “of the game which your hands and spears may reach” that is, the small ones “with your hands and spears” that is, the large ones, and that was at Al-Hudaybiyyah while they were in ihram, so the wild animals and birds would overtake them in their state “that Allah may make evident” the apparent knowledge “who fears Him in secret” that is, absent, he did not see Him, so he avoids the game “but whoever transgresses after that” the prohibition against it and hunts it “will have a painful punishment.” “O you who have believed, do not kill game while you are in ihram” in ihram for Hajj or Umrah “and whoever among you kills it intentionally, the penalty” with the tanween and raising what follows it, that is, he is subject to a penalty that is “like that which he killed from the livestock” that is, it resembles it in creation, and in a reading with the addition of a penalty “that two just men among you may judge by it” that is, by similarity “two just men among you” who have the intelligence to distinguish between the most similar things to it. Ibn Abbas, Omar and Ali, may Allah be pleased with them, judged the ostrich with a camel, and Ibn Abbas and Abu Ubaidah judged the wild cow and its donkey With his cow and Ibn Omar and Ibn Awf in the gazelle with a sheep and Ibn Abbas and Omar and others ruled with it in the pigeon because it resembles it in the slave “a gift” is a state of the reward “reaching the Kaaba” meaning he reaches it with it the sanctuary and slaughters it and gives it in charity to its poor and it is not permissible to slaughter it wherever it is and its accusative is a description of what preceded it even if it is added because its addition is verbal and does not provide definition. If there is no equivalent to the hunted animal such as a sparrow or a locust, then he must pay its value “or” he must pay “expiation” other than the reward and if he finds it, it is “food for the poor” from the country’s staple food what is equal to its value the reward for each poor person is a mudd and in a reading with the addition of expiation for what comes after it and it is for clarification “or” he must “justify” like “that” food “fasting” he fasts it for each mudd one day and if he finds it, that is obligatory for him “so that he may taste the consequences” the weight of the reward “of his command” that he did “Allah has pardoned what is past” of killing the game before it was forbidden “and whoever returns” to it “then Allah will take revenge on him and Allah is Exalted” dominant over his command “possessor of vengeance” from those who disobeyed Him and the truth He killed him intentionally, as mentioned in the error.
j-0257	“Lawful to you” O people, whether you are lawful or forbidden, “is the game of the sea” to eat it, which is what lives only in it, like fish, unlike what lives in it and on land, like crabs. “And its food” is what it throws up dead “as provision” for you, to eat, “and for the travelers” the travelers among you take provisions from it. “But forbidden to you is the game of the land” which is what lives in it of the edible wild animals, that you hunt it “as long as you are in the state of ihram.” If a lawful person hunts it, then the pilgrim may eat it, as the Sunnah has explained. “And fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered.” “Allah has made the Kaaba, the Sacred House” the sacred place “a support for mankind” by which their religious affairs are sustained by the pilgrimage to it and their worldly affairs are sustained by the security of its interior and the absence of exposure to it, and the fruits of everything are collected to it. In the reading of “qiyaman” without an alif, it is a source of standing without a vowel. “And the sacred month” meaning the sacred months of Dhu al-Qi’dah, Dhu al-Hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab, as a support for them in their security from fighting in them, “and the offerings and the necklaces” as a support for them in the security of their owner from exposure to him. “That” the mentioned provision “so that you may know that Allah knows.” What is in the heavens and what is on the earth, and that God is All-Knowing of all things. If He made that to bring you benefits and to ward off harm from you before they occur, this is evidence of His knowledge of what is in existence and what is to come. Know that God is severe in penalty, of His enemies, and that God is Forgiving, Most Merciful, of His friends. The Messenger has no duty except to convey [the message] to you, and God knows what you reveal and what you conceal, so He will reward you for it. Say, “The evil and the good are not equal, even if the abundance of evil pleases you.” So fear God, O people of understanding, that you may succeed.
j-0258	And it was revealed when they asked him a lot, may God bless him and grant him peace: “O you who have believed, do not ask about things which, if they are made known to you, will distress you,” because of the difficulty involved. “But if you ask about them when the Qur’an is revealed,” during the time of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “they will be made known to you,” meaning if you ask about things during his time when the Qur’an is revealed by revealing them, and when he reveals them, they will distress you, then do not ask about them. “God has pardoned them,” from your asking, so do not return to them. “And God is Forgiving and Merciful.” “People before you asked about them,” that is, the things, “and they became,” they became, “disbelievers in them,” by abandoning acting upon them.
j-0259	“Allah’s law has not made any bahīrah, sa’ībah, wasīlah, or Ḥām,” as the people of the Jahiliyyah used to do. Al-Bukhārī narrated on the authority of Sa’īd ibn al-Musayyab, who said: “The bahīrah is the one whose milk is forbidden to the tyrants, so no one among the people would milk it. The Ḥām is the one that they would leave for their gods, so nothing would be carried on it. The wasīlah is the virgin she-camel that gives birth to a female first in the first generation of camels, then gives birth to two more after that with a female. They would leave it for their tyrants if one of them was mated with another, with no male between them. The Ḥām is the male camel that strikes the numbered dates. When it has finished striking, they leave it for the tyrants and exempt it from having anything carried on it, and they call it the Ḥāmī. “But those who disbelieve invent a lie against Allah,” in that and in attributing it to Him. “And most of them do not reason,” that this is an invention because they imitated their fathers in that. “And when it is said to them, ‘Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger,’” that is, to His ruling on making permissible what you have forbidden, “they say, ‘Sufficient for us,’” is sufficient “that which we found our fathers following,” of religion and law. Allah the Almighty said, “Is that sufficient for them?” “And if only they had not done so.” Their fathers did not know anything, nor were they guided to the truth. The question is for denial. O you who have believed, upon you is yourselves, meaning, protect them and take care of their well-being. He who has gone astray will not harm you if you are guided. It was said that what is meant is that he who has gone astray from the People of the Book will not harm you, and it was said that what is meant is others, based on the hadith of Abu Tha’labah Al-Khushani. I asked the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, about it, and he said, “Command what is right and forbid what is wrong, until when you see greed being obeyed, the world being preferred, and everyone admiring his opinion, then you should be concerned with yourself.” Narrated by Al-Hakim and others. To God you will all return, and He will inform you of what you used to do and will reward you for it.
j-0260	“O you who have believed, let there be testimony among you when death approaches one of you” that is, its causes “at the time of making a will, two just men from among you” news with the meaning of a command, that is, to bear witness, and adding testimony to “between” is a broad meaning, and when is a substitute for “if” or a circumstance for “attended” “or two others from outside you” that is, not from your religion “if you travel” travel “throughout the land and the disaster of death befalls you, you detain them” you detain them is an attribute of the other two “after the prayer” that is, the afternoon prayer “and they swear” they swear “by God if you have doubts” you doubt it and they say “We do not exchange it” by God “a price” a compensation that we take in exchange for it from this world by swearing by it or bearing false witness for it “even if” the one to whom the oath is made or the one to whom God bears witness “is a relative” a relative to us “nor do we conceal the testimony of God” that we have been commanded “for if” if we conceal it “we are among the sinners” “but if it is found” it is discovered after their oath “that they have deserved a sin” that is, they have done what requires it of treachery or lying In the testimony that they found with them, for example, what they were accused of and they claimed that they bought it from the deceased or that he bequeathed it to them, “then two others shall take their place” in directing the oath to them “from those who are entitled to it” the bequest, and they are the heirs. And the “first two” are replaced by the deceased, meaning the closest to him. In the reading of the first two, the first is a plural of description or a replacement for those. “So they swear by God” about the betrayal of the two witnesses and say, “Our testimony” our oath “is more valid” more truthful “than their testimony” their oath “and we have not transgressed” we have exceeded the right in the oath “for then we would be among the wrongdoers.” The meaning is that the dying person should have two witnesses to his bequest or he should bequeath to them from among his co-religionists or others if he lost them due to travel or the like. If the heirs doubt them and claim that they betrayed by taking something or giving it to someone they claimed that the deceased bequeathed it to him, then they should swear, and so on. If he finds evidence of their denial and they claim that someone paid it, the closest of the heirs should swear to their lie and the truth of what they claimed, and the ruling is established in The guardians were abrogated in the two witnesses, and so was the testimony of non-Muslims. The consideration of the afternoon prayer is for emphasis, and the oath in the verse is specific to two of the closest heirs for the specific incident for which it was revealed, which is what Al-Bukhari narrated that a man from Banu Sahm went out with Tamim Al-Dari and Adi bin Bada’, meaning they were Christians. Al-Sahmi died in a land where there were no Muslims. When they came with his estate, they lost a silver cup decorated with gold, so they brought it to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, so it was revealed, so he made them swear. Then he found the cup in Mecca, and they said, “We bought it from Tamim and Adi.” So the second verse was revealed, so two men from the guardians of Al-Sahmi stood up and swore. In Al-Tirmidhi, Amr bin Al-Aas and another man from them stood up and swore, and he was closer to him. In another narration, he fell ill, so he made a will to them and ordered them to deliver what his family left behind. When he died, they took the cup and gave what remained to his family. “That” the aforementioned ruling of returning the oath to the heirs “is closer” to “they” meaning the witnesses or guardians “bringing the testimony in its proper form.” Which they bear without distortion or betrayal, “or” closer to “fearing that oaths will be returned after their oaths” on the claiming heirs, so they swear to their betrayal and lies, and they will be disgraced and fined, so they will not lie. “And fear God” by abandoning betrayal and lies, “and listen” to what you are commanded to do with an accepting listening, “and God does not guide the wicked people” those who have disobeyed Him to the path of goodness.
j-0261	Remember, “On the Day when God will gather the messengers,” that is, the Day of Resurrection, “and He will say,” to them, as a rebuke to their people, “What,” that is, “was your answer?” They will say, “We have no knowledge,” of that, “Indeed, You are the Knower of the unseen,” that which is hidden from the servants and the knowledge of which has gone away from them due to the intensity of the terror of the Day of Resurrection and their fear. Then they will bear witness against their nations when they calm down.
j-0262	Remember, “When God said, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother,’ by thanking her, ‘when I supported you,’ strengthened you, ‘with the Holy Spirit,’ Gabriel, ‘speaking to the people,’” a state of the kaf in ‘aidataka, ‘in the cradle,’ meaning as a child, ‘and as an adult,’ indicating that he descended before the Hour because he was raised before adulthood, as mentioned in Al Imran. “And when I taught you the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel, and when you created from clay the figure, like the form, of a bird,’” the kaf is a noun meaning like the object, “with My permission, and you breathed into it and it became a bird, with My permission, with My will, ‘and you healed the blind and the leper, with My permission, and when I brought forth the dead, from their graves alive, ‘with My permission, and when I restrained the Children of Israel from you,’ when they intended to kill you, “when you came to them with clear proofs,’ but those who disbelieved among them said, ‘This,’ that you have come, ‘is nothing but obvious magic,’” and in another reading, a magician, meaning Jesus. “And when I inspired the disciples,’ I commanded them through his tongue, “that,’ meaning that “Believe in Me and My Messenger” Jesus. “They said, ‘We believe’ in them, “and bear witness that we are Muslims.”
j-0263	Remember, “When the disciples said, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table spread from the heaven?’” In another reading, it is with a fathah and the accusative of what follows it, meaning that you can ask Him, “to send down to us a table spread from the heaven.” Jesus said, “Fear God, if you are believers.” They said, “We desire,” to ask it in order “to eat from it and our hearts be reassured,” with increased certainty, “and to know,” increase in knowledge, “that” its lightened form, meaning that you “have told us the truth,” in claiming prophethood, “and to be among its witnesses.” “Jesus, son of Mary, said, ‘O God, our Lord, send down to us a table spread from the heaven that will be for us,’ that is, the day of its descent, “a festival,” that we will venerate and honor, “for the first of us,’” instead of “for us,” by returning the preposition, “and a sign from You,’” of Your power and my prophethood, “and provide for us, for You are the best of providers.” “God said, responding to him, “Indeed, I will send it down to you, so who will disbelieve after that?” that is, after its descent, “of you?” “Then the angels descended from heaven with seven loaves of bread and seven fish, and they ate from them until they were full.” This was said by Ibn Abbas. In a hadith, the table was brought down from heaven with bread and meat, and they were commanded not to betray or save for tomorrow, but they were afraid and saved, and they were transformed into monkeys and pigs.
j-0264	“And” remember “when God said” that is, God will say to Jesus on the Day of Resurrection, rebuking his people “O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, ‘Take me and my mother as gods besides God?’ He said” Jesus, and he thundered “Glory be to You” purifying You from what is not befitting of You, such as partners or others. “It is not right for me to say what I have no right to say” the predicate of “not my guardian” for clarification. “If I have said it, You know it. You know what” I conceal “in a soul, and I do not know what is in your soul” that is, what you conceal of Your knowledge “Indeed, You are the Knower of the unseen.” “I said to them nothing but what You commanded me” which is “Worship God, my Lord and your Lord. And I was a witness over them” a watcher who prevented them from what they said “while I was among them. But when You took me” You took me by raising me to heaven “You were the Watcher over them” the Preserver of their deeds “and You are, over all things” of what I said to them and what they say after me and other things “Witness” seeing and knowing it. “If You should punish them” that is, those who persist in disbelief among them “they are Your servants.” And you are their owner, you dispose of them as you wish, there is no objection to you. “And if you forgive them,” that is, those who believe among them, “then indeed, you are the Exalted in Might,” the One who is victorious over His affair, “the Wise,” in His creation. “Allah said, ‘This,’ that is, the Day of Resurrection, “is a day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness,” in this world, like Jesus, “because it is the Day of Recompense.” “For them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. Allah is pleased with them,” through His obedience, “and they are pleased with Him,” through His reward. “That is the great attainment.” And the truthfulness of the liars in this world will not benefit them, like the disbelievers, when they believe when they see the punishment. “To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth,” the treasuries of rain, plants, sustenance, and other things, “and whatever is in them,” He brought what is given to the non-rational, “and He is over all things competent,” and from this is the reward of the truthful and the punishment of the liar, and He singled out the mind itself, so it is not capable of it.
j-0265	"“Praise” which is the beautiful description is established “for Allah” and is the intention to inform about that for belief in Him and to praise Him or are there two possibilities that are more beneficial, the third of which was said by the Sheikh in Surat Al-Kahf “Who created the heavens and the earth” He singled them out for mention because they are the greatest of creations for the observers “and made” He created “the darkness and the light” meaning all darkness and light and gathered them together without Him due to the multitude of their causes and this is from the evidence of His Oneness “Then those who disbelieve” despite the existence of this evidence “ascribe equals” to their Lord in worship “It is He who created you from clay” by creating your father Adam from him “Then He decreed a term” for you at the end of which you will die “And a specified term” set “With Him” for your resurrection “Then you” O disbelievers “are in doubt” You doubt about the resurrection after your knowledge that He began your creation and He who is able to begin is more able to repeat it
“And He is Allah” deserving of worship “in the heavens and on the earth. He knows your secret and your public” what you conceal and what you declare among yourselves “And He knows what you earn” what you do from Good and evil"
j-0266	"“And there does not come to them” i.e. the people of Mecca “from” an extra “sign from the signs of their Lord” from the Qur’an “except that they turn away from it.” “They have denied the truth” the Qur’an “when it came to them. So there will come to them news” of the consequences “of what they used to ridicule.” “Have they not seen” in their travels to Syria and elsewhere “how many” a news item meaning many “we destroyed before them a generation” a nation from the past nations “we established” we gave them a place “on the earth” with power and spaciousness “that which we have not established” we give “to you” in which there is a shift from the third person “and we sent the sky” rain “upon them in torrents” successively “and made rivers flow beneath them” beneath their dwellings “and we destroyed them for their sins” for their denial of the prophets “and brought forth after them another generation” “and if We had sent down to you a book” written “on parchment” parchment as they suggested “and they touched it with their hands” it is more eloquent than seeing it because it removes doubt “the disbelievers would have said ""This is nothing but obvious magic,"" she insisted."
j-0267	"""And they said, 'Why was there not sent down to him' to Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, 'an angel' who would confirm him? ' And if We had sent down an angel, as they suggested but they did not believe, 'the matter would have been decided' with their destruction, 'and then they would not be reprieved' they would not be given respite for repentance or an excuse, as is God's custom with those before them, in their destruction when their suggestion is made if they do not believe. ' And if We had made him, that is, the one sent down to them, 'an angel, We would have made him, that is, the angel, 'a man,' that is, in His image so that they would be able to see him, since humans do not have the power to see an angel. ' And if We had sent him down and made him a man, 'We would have covered them with what they cover,' with themselves, so that they would say, 'This is only a human being like you. ' And messengers before you were mocked,' in it is consolation for the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, 'so that which they mocked at encompassed,' it was sent down, 'those who mocked them with that which they used to mock,' which is the punishment, so that is how those who mocked you will be encompassed. ' Say, to them, 'Travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied,' the messengers from Their destruction by torment so that they may take heed."
j-0268	"«Say, ""To whom belongs what is in the heavens and the earth?"" Say, ""To God."" If they do not say it, there is no answer other than Him. «He has decreed upon Himself mercy» as a favor from Him and in it is His gentleness in calling them to faith «that He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection» to reward you for your deeds «there is no doubt» doubt «about it. Those who have lost their souls» by exposing them to punishment is the subject and its predicate «so they will not believe.» «And to Him» the Most High «is whatever dwells» in the night and the day» that is, everything is its Lord, Creator and Owner «and He is the Hearing» of what is said «the Knowing» of what He does. «Say» to them, «Shall I take a protector other than God» to worship Him «the Creator of the heavens and the earth» their Creator «and He feeds» provides «and does not feed» provides «say, ""Indeed, I have been commanded to be the first of this nation to submit» to God «and» it was said to me «do not be of those who associate others with Him» with Him. «Say, ""Indeed, I fear, if I disobey my Lord» by worshipping other than Him «the punishment of a tremendous Day» that is, the Day of Resurrection.» «Who will turn away» by construction For the passive participle, that is, the torment, and for the active participle, that is, God, and the antecedent is omitted. “From him on that Day, He will have mercy on him,” that is, He willed good for him. “And that is the manifest attainment,” the apparent salvation. “And if God should touch you with adversity,” an affliction such as illness or poverty, “there is none who can remove it,” who can lift it, “except Him.” And if He should touch you with good, such as health or wealth, “then He is over all things competent,” and from this comes the word “to touch” which means “to touch” and no one else is able to repel it from you. “And He is the Prevailing,” the Able, for whom nothing is beyond His power, exalted, “over His servants, and He is the Wise,” in His creation, “the Acquainted,” with their inner selves as well as their outer selves."
j-0269	"And it was revealed when they said to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “Bring us someone who will testify to your prophethood, for the People of the Book have denied you.” “Say,” to them, “What is the greatest testimony?” “Say, ‘God is a witness between me and you.’” If they do not say it, there is no other answer, which is “and this Qur’an has been revealed to me that I may warn you with it and whomever it reaches.” It is an apodosis to the pronoun “I warn you,” meaning in the language of the Qur’an, about mankind and jinn. “Do you indeed bear witness that there are other gods with God?” A rhetorical question. “Say,” to them, “I do not bear witness,” to that. “Say, ‘He is only one God, and I am innocent of what you associate with Him, of idols.’ Those to whom We gave the Scripture know him,” meaning Muhammad, by his description in their book, “as they know their own sons. Those who have lost themselves,” of them, “so they do not believe,” in him. “And who,” meaning no one, “is more unjust than he who invents a lie against God,” by attributing a partner to Him, “or denies His verses,” the Qur’an. “He,” meaning the matter, “will not succeed.” ""The oppressors"" with that"

“And they forbid” people “from it” from following the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “and they keep away” they distance themselves “from it” so they do not believe in him. It was said that it was revealed about Abu Talib, who used to forbid harming him but did not believe in him. “And they destroy” by keeping away from him “except themselves” because of its harm to them “and they do not perceive” that."
j-0271	“And if you could but see,” O Muhammad, “when they are made to stand before the Fire and say, ‘Oh, would that we could be returned’ to the world and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among the believers’” by raising the two verbs as a resumption and lowering them as an answer to the wish, raising the first and lowering the second and answering if you saw a great matter. God Almighty said, “Rather,” to strike out the will to believe understood from the wish, “what they used to conceal before has become apparent to them,” they conceal by saying, “By God, our Lord, we were not polytheists,” the testimony of their limbs, so they wished for that. “And if they were returned,” to the world as an obligation, “they would return to what they were forbidden,” of polytheism, “and indeed, they are liars,” in their promise of faith. “And they will say,” that is, denying the resurrection, “It is nothing,” that is, life, “but our worldly life, and we will not be resurrected.” “And if you could but see when they are made to stand before their Lord,” you would see a great matter. He said, on the tongues of the angels, as a rebuke, “Is this,” the resurrection and the reckoning, “not the truth?” They said, “Yes.” And our Lord, it is the truth. He said, “Then taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve in” in it in this world. “Those who denied the meeting with Allah have certainly lost out” in the Resurrection “until” the end of the denial “when the Hour comes to them” the Resurrection “suddenly” suddenly “they will say, ‘Oh, our regret’” it is the intensity of the pain and its call is a metaphor, meaning this is your time, so attend “for what we neglected” we fell short “in it” meaning the world “and they will bear their burdens on their backs” by it coming to them at the Resurrection in the ugliest form and the most foul smelling thing and it will overtake them “How evil” how miserable “is that which they bear” they will carry it, that is their burden. “And the life of this world” meaning preoccupation with it “is nothing but play and amusement” as for obedience and what helps in it are matters of the Hereafter “and the home of the Hereafter” and in another reading “and the home of the Hereafter” meaning Paradise “is better for those who fear” polytheism “so will they not understand” with the letter ya and the letter ta’ that and believe
j-0272	“We know” for certainty “that what they say” to you of denial “grieves you, for indeed they do not call you a liar” in secret because they know that you are truthful. In a reading with alleviation, meaning they do not attribute lying to you “but the wrongdoers” put it in place of the implied “the signs of God” the Qur’an “deny” they lie. “And messengers were denied before you” in it is a consolation for the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace “but they were patient over what they were denied and harmed until Our victory came to them” by destroying their people, so be patient until victory comes to you by destroying your people “and there is no changer of the words of God” His promises “and there has certainly come to you from the news of the messengers” that which will calm your heart. “And if it is too great” great “for you that they turn away” from Islam because of your concern for them “then if you are able to seek a tunnel” a passage “into the earth or a ladder” an ascent “into the heaven and bring them a sign” of what they suggested, then do so, meaning that you are not able to do that, so be patient until God decides “even if” God willed their guidance, to unite them on guidance. But if He had not willed that, they would not have believed. So do not be among the ignorant.
j-0273	"“Only those who listen will respond to your call to faith, and those who hear, hear with understanding and consideration. And the dead, that is, the disbelievers, he likened them to them in not hearing. “Allah will resurrect them, then to Him they will be returned.” They will be returned, and He will reward them for their deeds. “And they will say,” that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, “Why was a sign not sent down to him from his Lord?” Like the she-camel, the staff, and the table. “Say,” to them, “Indeed, Allah is able to send down,” with emphasis and with emphasis, “a sign,” of what they suggested. “But most of them do not know,” that its sending down is a trial for them, since they must perish if they deny it. “And there is no creature,” with an extra letter, “on the earth, nor a bird that flies,” in the air, “with its wings, except that they are communities like you,” in managing their creation, their sustenance, and their conditions. “We have neglected nothing,” with an extra letter, “in the Book,” the Preserved Tablet, “so we did not write it down.” “Then to their Lord they will be gathered,” among them, and He will exact retribution for the two horns, then He will say to them, “Be dust.” “And those who deny Our signs” the Qur’an “are deaf” to hearing it with acceptance “and dumb” to speaking the truth “in darkness” disbelief “whom Allah wills” to misguide “He misguides, and whom He wills” to guide “He places on a straight path” the religion of Islam

“Say” O Muhammad to the people of Mecca “Have you considered” tell me “if the punishment of Allah comes upon you” in this world “or the Hour comes upon you” the Resurrection that includes it suddenly “is it other than Allah that you call upon” no “if you should be truthful” in that the idols benefit you, then call upon them

“Rather, it is Him” and no other “that you call upon” in times of hardship “and He will remove what you call upon” to remove from you the harm and the like “if He wills” to remove it “and you will forget” abandon “what you associate” with Him of idols and not call upon Him"
j-0274	«And We had certainly sent to nations before you» redundant «messengers, but they denied them «so We seized them with poverty» severe poverty «and hardship» sickness «that they might humble themselves» humble themselves and believe «so why» why «when Our punishment» came to them «did they not humble themselves» that is, they did not do that despite the necessity for it «but their hearts hardened» so they did not soften to faith «and Satan made attractive to them what they were doing» of sins, so they persisted in them «so when they forgot» abandoned «that which they had remembered» they were admonished and frightened «by» of poverty and hardship, but they did not take heed «we opened» with the softening and emphasis «to them the doors of every [good] thing» of blessings, to lure them «until, when they rejoiced in what they had been given» the joy of arrogance «we seized them» with the punishment «suddenly» suddenly «and at once they were in despair» despairing of all good «so He cut off the root of the people who did wrong» that is, the last of them, by uprooting them «and praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds» for victory The Messengers and the Destruction of the Unbelievers
j-0275	«Say» to the people of Mecca «Have you considered» tell me «if Allah takes away your hearing» deafens you «and your sight» blinds you «and sets a seal» imprint «upon your hearts» so that you do not know anything «what god other than Allah can bring it to you» what He took from you according to your claim «look how We direct» explain «the signs» the evidence of Our oneness «and then they turn away» they turn away from them and do not believe». «Say» to them «Have you considered if the punishment of Allah comes upon you suddenly or openly» by night or day «is anyone destroyed except the wrongdoing people» the disbelievers, meaning none is destroyed except them? «And We send the messengers only as bringers of good tidings» those who believe in Paradise «and as warners» those who disbelieve in Hell «so whoever believes» in them «and amends» his deeds «there is no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve» in the Hereafter. «And those who deny Our signs, the punishment will touch them because they were defiantly» they disobeyed. «Say» to them «I do not say to you that with me are the treasures of Allah» from which He provides. “Nor do I know the unseen,” that which is hidden from me and has not been revealed to me. “Nor do I tell you that I am an angel,” that is, one of the angels. “I follow only what is revealed to me.” Say, “Are the blind equal,” the disbeliever, “and the seeing equal,” the believer? “Then will you not reflect?”
j-0276	«And warn» fear «with it» meaning the Qur’an «those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord. They will have no protector besides Him» meaning other than Him «nor intercessor» to intercede for them. The negative clause is a state of the pronoun of «will be gathered» and it is the place of fear, and what is meant by them are the disobedient ones «that they may fear» God by ceasing what they are doing and performing acts of obedience. «And do not drive away those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, desiring» through their worship «His Face» the Most High, not any worldly gain, and they are the poor. The polytheists had slandered them and asked that he drive them away so that they would sit with him, and the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, wanted that out of hope that they would convert to Islam. «There is nothing upon you regarding their account» redundant «nor is there anything regarding your account against them, that you should drive them away» the answer to the negative «and thus be among the wrongdoers» if you did that.
j-0277	«And thus We have tried» We have tested «some of them by others» that is, the noble by the lowly and the rich by the poor, by putting them first in faith «that they may say» that is, the noble and the rich are deniers «are these» the poor «upon whom Allah has bestowed guidance from among us» that is, if what they are upon was guidance, they would not have preceded us to it. God Almighty said «is not Allah most knowing of those who are grateful» to Him, so He guides them? Yes. «And when those who believe in Our verses come to you, say» to them «Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed» decreed «for Himself mercy. Indeed» that is, the matter, and in a reading with the fat-ha instead of mercy «whoever among you does evil in ignorance» on his part «and then repents» returns «after that» after doing it «and amends» his work «then indeed» that is, Allah «is Forgiving» to him «and Merciful» to him. And in a reading with the fat-ha, that is, forgiveness is for him. «And thus» as we have explained what was mentioned «We detail» We explain «the verses» the Qur’an so that the truth may be made apparent and so that the path» the way «of the criminals may be made clear» make apparent «the way» the path «of the criminals». So avoid, and in a reading with the lower one and in another with the upper one, and the accusative of the path is an address to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace. “Say, ‘Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you call upon, besides God. Say, ‘I do not follow your desires,’ in worshipping them. ‘I would have gone astray, then,’ if I followed them, ‘and I am not of the [rightly] guided.’” “Say, ‘Indeed, I am upon clear evidence,’ a statement, ‘from my Lord, and,’ and you have denied it,’ with my Lord when you associated partners with Him. ‘I do not have that for which you are hastening,’ of the punishment. ‘Indeed, the judgment,’ in that and other matters, ‘is only God’s. He decrees, the judgment, ‘the truth, and He is the best of judges.’” And in a reading, ‘He relates,’ that is, he says. “Say,’ to them, ‘If I had that for which you are hastening, the matter would have been decided between me and you,’ by hastening it for you and I would be at ease, but it is with God. ‘And God knows best about the wrongdoers,’ when He will punish them.”
j-0278	And with Him, the Most High, are the keys of the unseen, His treasures, or the paths leading to His work, which none knows but Him. They are the five mentioned in His statement, “Indeed, with Allah is knowledge of the Hour,” as narrated by Al-Bukhari. He knows what happens on land, in deserts, in seas, in towns on rivers. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And there is no grain within the darknesses of the earth, nor anything moist or dry, except that it is in a clear book, which is the Preserved Tablet. The exception is a substitute for inclusion from the exception before it.
j-0279	“And it is He who takes your souls at night” He takes your souls when you sleep “and knows what you have committed” you have earned “during the day. Then He raises you up therein” that is, the day by returning your souls “that a specified term may be fulfilled” that is, the term of life. “Then to Him is your return.” “Then He informs you of what you used to do” and He will reward you for it. “And He is the Dominant” High “over His servants. And He sends over you guardians” angels who count your deeds “until, when death comes to one of you, He takes him” in another reading, “Our messengers” the angels assigned to take the souls “and they do not fail” they fall short in what they are commanded to do. “Then they are returned” that is, creation “to Allah, their Master” their Owner “the Truth” the steadfast and just, so that He may reward them. “Unquestionably, His is the judgment” the judgment that is effective over them. “And He is the swiftest of reckoners” He will reckon all creation in the space of half a day of the days of this world, according to a hadith about that.
j-0280	"«Say» O Muhammad to the people of Mecca «Who will save you from the darknesses of the land and the sea» their terrors during your travels when «you call upon Him humbly» openly «and secretly» secretly you say «If» the lam of an oath «you should save us» and in another reading it is anjana meaning Allah «from this» darkness and hardships «we will surely be among the grateful» the believers «Say» to them «Allah will save you» with the emphasis and the emphasis «from it and from every distress» grief other than it «then you associate» with Him« Say: He is able to send upon you a punishment from above you from the sky like stones and a blast or from beneath your feet like a sinking earth or to confuse you and mix you into factions, groups differing in desires and let you taste the violence of one another in fighting» the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, said when this was revealed, it is easier and lighter, and when what preceded it was revealed, I seek refuge in Your Face, narrated by al-Bukhari and Muslim narrated a hadith, I asked my Lord not to make the violence of my nation among themselves, but He prevented me. And in a hadith, when it was revealed, he said: It will happen and its interpretation has not yet come After that, see how we spend. We show them the signs of evidence of our power, so that they may understand and know that what they are upon is false. ""And your people denied it,"" the Qur'an, ""while it is the truth,"" the truth. ""Say,"" to them, ""I am not a guardian over you,"" so I will punish you. I am only a warner, and your affair is with God. This was before the command to fight. ""For every story,"" news, ""there is a set time,"" a time in which it occurs and is settled, and from it is your punishment. ""And you will come to know,"" a threat to them."
j-0281	“And when you see those who engage in discourse concerning Our verses,” the Qur’an, mockingly, “then turn away from them,” and do not sit with them, “until they engage in another conversation. Or” in this there is an assimilation of the nun of the conditional in with what is added, “Satan makes you forget,” with the nun silent and the fatha and the shaddah, so you sat with them. “So do not sit after the reminder,” that is, a reminder, “with the wrongdoing people,” in this there is a placement of the apparent in place of the implicit, and the Muslims said that if we stand up every time they engage in discourse, we will not be able to sit in the mosque or circumambulate, so it was revealed: “And there is no reckoning for those who fear God,” that is, the engagers, “of anything,” if they sit with them, “but there is a reminder for them,” a reminder to them and an admonition, “that they may fear God,” engaging in discourse. “And leave,” leave, “those who have taken their religion,” which they were charged with, “as play and amusement,” by mocking it, “and whom the life of this world has deceived,” so do not expose yourself to them, and this is before the command to fight. “And remind,” admonish, “therewith,” with the Qur’an, for the people, “that,” not “A soul will be destroyed for what it has earned. It will have no protector or intercessor besides God. And if it were to offer every ransom, nothing would be accepted from it.” “Those are the ones who will be destroyed for what they have earned. For them will be a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what they used to disbelieve.”
j-0282	«Say: Shall we invoke, besides God, that which neither benefits us nor harms us, by abandoning it, namely the idols, «and turn back on our heels» as polytheists «after God has guided us» to Islam «like one whom the devils have led astray upon the earth, bewildered» perplexed, not knowing where to go? He has companions» company «inviting him to guidance» that is, to show him the way, they say to him «Come to us» but he does not answer them and is destroyed. The interrogative is for denial and its phrase is a simile for the pronoun «we return». «Say: Indeed, the guidance of God» which is Islam «is the guidance» and everything else is misguidance «and He has commanded us to submit» that is, to submit «to the Lord of the worlds» «and» that is, to establish prayer and fear Him» the Most High «and it is to Him you will be gathered» you will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection for the reckoning. «And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth» that is, in truth «and» remember «the Day He will say» to the thing «Be» and it is» that is, the Day of Resurrection. He says to the creation, “Stand up.” “His word is the truth,” the truth that will inevitably occur. “And His is the dominion on the Day the Trumpet is blown,” the second trumpet blast from Israfil. No one else has dominion over it. To whom does dominion belong today? “Knower of the unseen and the witnessed,” what is hidden and what is seen. “And He is the Wise,” in His creation, “the Acquainted,” with the inner aspects of things as well as their outer aspects.
j-0283	«And» remember «when Abraham said to his father Azar» his title and his name was Tarakh «Do you take idols as gods» to worship them? This is a question of rebuke «Indeed, I see you and your people» by taking them «in manifest error» from the truth «and thus» just as We showed him the misguidance of his father and his people «We showed Abraham the kingdom» the kingdom «of the heavens and the earth» to prove by it Our oneness «and that he might be among the certain» in it. The clause «and thus» and what follows it are an interjection and a conjunction to said. «So when the night covered» darkened «upon him, he saw a star» it was said that it was Venus «He said» to his people and they were astrologers «This is my Lord» according to your claim «So when it sets» it disappeared «He said I do not like those that set» to take them as lords because the Lord is not subject to change and transition because these are the nature of accidents. So that did not work with them. «So when he saw the moon rising» rising «He said» to them «This is my Lord. And when it set, he said, If He does not guide me “My Lord,” he said, “make me steadfast on the right path,” “that I may surely be among the people who have gone astray,” referring to his people as being in error, but that did not work on them. “So when he saw the sun rising, he said, ‘This,’” he mentioned it to remind them of his news, “is my Lord, this is greater,” than the planets and the moon. “But when it set,” and the argument was strengthened against them and they did not return, “he said, ‘O my people, indeed I am innocent of what you associate,’” with God of idols and created bodies that need an innovator. They said to him, “How far-fetched is that?’” He said, “Indeed, I have turned my face,” meaning with my worship, “to Him who created,” created, “the heavens and the earth,” meaning God, “inclining toward the upright religion, and I am not of those who associate others with Him.”

""And I do not fear what you associate with Him"" ​​of the idols that they would harm me because of their inability to do anything ""except"" but ""that my Lord should will something"" of the unpleasant thing that would befall me, so ""My Lord encompasses all things in knowledge"" meaning His knowledge encompasses all things.

God Almighty said: “Those who believe and do not mix” mix “their belief with injustice” that is, polytheism, as explained in the hadith of the two Sahihs. “For them is security” from punishment “and they are [rightly] guided.” “And that” is a subject and is replaced by “Our proof” with which Abraham argued for the oneness of God from the setting of the planet and what came after it, and the predicate is “We gave it to Abraham” We guided him to it as a proof “over his people.

And We have not made you a guardian over them” a watcher so that you would recompense them for their deeds “nor are you a disposer of affairs over them” so that you would force them to believe. This was before the command to fight. “And do not insult those they invoke” they “other than Allah” meaning the idols “lest they insult Allah in enmity” aggressively and unjustly “without knowledge” meaning out of ignorance on their part about Allah “thus” as We have made what they are doing seem good to them “We have made seem good to every nation their deeds” of good and evil, so they do it “then to their Lord is their return” in the Hereafter “and He will inform them of what they used to do” so He will recompense them for it

""And We will turn their hearts"" We will turn their hearts away from the truth so that they do not understand it ""and their eyes"" from it so that they do not see it and do not believe ""just as they did not believe in it"" that is, in what was revealed of the signs ""the first time, and We will leave them"" We will leave them ""in their transgression"" their misguidance ""wandering blindly"" they will hesitate and bewildered. ""And if We had sent down to them the angels and completed them the dead"" as they proposed ""and gathered"" We pluralized ""against them all things in a group"" with two dammahs, plural of qabal, meaning in a group, and with the kasrah of the qaf and the fathah The letter Ya means to witness, so they testified to your truthfulness. “They would not believe” because of what had preceded in God’s knowledge “unless” but “if God wills” their belief, so they believe, “but most of them are ignorant” of that."
j-0292	“And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy,” just as We have made these your enemies, and He substitutes for it “devils,” rebellious “among mankind and jinn, inspiring,” whispering, “some of them to others adorned speech,” disguised as falsehood, “in delusion,” that is, to mislead them. “And if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it,” that is, the aforementioned inspiration. “So leave them,” leave the disbelievers, “and what they invent,” of disbelief and other things that have been made attractive to them, and this is before the command to fight. “And that the hearts,” the hearts, “of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may listen to it,” in apposition to “delusion,” that is, the adornment, “may be pleased with it and commit,” acquire, “what they are committing,” of sins for which they will be punished.
j-0293	And it was revealed when they asked the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, to appoint a judge between him and them. Say, “Shall I seek other than God as a judge between me and you, while He is the One who has sent down to you the Book, the Qur’an, in detail, clarifying truth from falsehood. And those to whom We gave the Book, the Torah, such as Abdullah ibn Salam and his companions, “know that it has been sent down from your Lord in truth. So do not be among the doubters,” those who doubt it. What is meant by that is to confirm to the disbelievers that it is true. “And the words of your Lord have been fulfilled,” with the rulings and promises, “in truth and justice,” in distinction. “There is no changing His words,” with deficiency or failure. “And He is the Hearing,” of what is said, “the Knowing,” of what He does. “And if you obey most of those on the earth,” that is, the disbelievers, “they will mislead you from the way of God,” His religion. “They follow nothing but conjecture,” in their argument with you about the matter of dead meat, when they said, “What God has killed is more deserving of your eating than what you have killed.” “They are only guessing,” they lie about that. “Your Lord is He.” “I know” meaning “whoever goes astray from His way, and He knows best who are guided.” So He will reward each of them.
j-0294	"""So eat of that over which the name of God has been mentioned"" that is, slaughtered in His name ""if you are believers in His verses."" ""And what is the matter with you that you do not eat of that over which the name of God has been mentioned"" of the slaughtered animals ""and He has explained to you what He has forbidden you"" in the verse that carrion is forbidden to you ""except for that to which you are compelled"" of it, so it is also permissible for you, meaning there is no objection to you from eating what has been mentioned and He has explained to you what is forbidden to eat, and this is not from it. ""And indeed many go astray"" with the opening of the ya and the closing of the ya ""by their desires"" with what their souls desire of permitting carrion and other things ""without knowledge"" that they rely on in that ""Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of the transgressors"" the oversteppers. ""And leave"" leave ""the outward and inward sin"" its public and secret, and sin has been said to be adultery and it has been said to be every disobedience. ""Indeed, those who commit sin will be recompensed"" in the Hereafter ""for what they used to commit"" they acquired. ""And do not eat of that over which the name of God has not been mentioned"" by way of dying or slaughtering. In the name of someone other than Him, otherwise whatever a Muslim slaughters without mentioning His name over it intentionally or forgetfully is permissible. This was said by Ibn Abbas, and Al-Shafi’i agreed with him. “And indeed” that is, eating from it “is an act of disobedience” a departure from what is permissible. “And indeed, the devils inspire” whisper “to their allies” the infidels “that they may dispute with you” about the permissibility of carrion. “And if you obey them” in it “then indeed, you are polytheists.”"
j-0295	And it was revealed about Abu Jahl and others: “Or he who was dead” in disbelief “and We gave him life” with guidance “and made for him a light by which he walks among the people” by which he discerns the truth from other things, which is faith “like one whose likeness” is an extra word, meaning like one who is “in darkness, never emerging from it” which is the disbeliever. “Thus” as faith was made attractive to the believers “We made attractive to the disbelievers what they knew” of disbelief and sins. “Thus” as We made the wicked of Mecca its greatest “We made in every city its greatest criminals to plot therein” by turning away from faith “but they plot only against themselves” because its consequences are upon them “and they perceive” that. “And when there comes to them” meaning the people of Mecca “a sign” of the truthfulness of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “they say, ‘We will not believe’ in it “until we are given the like of that which was given to the messengers of God” of the message and revelation to us because we are wealthier and older.” God Almighty said: “God knows best where to place His messages” in the plural and singular, and “where” is the object of a verb indicated by “knows” meaning He knows the appropriate place. To put it in it, so he puts it, and these are not worthy of it. “Those who committed crimes will be afflicted” by saying that, “with humiliation” humiliation “in the sight of God and a severe punishment for what they were plotting” that is, because of their plotting.
j-0296	"""And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He expands his breast to Islam"" by casting light into his heart so that it becomes spacious and he accepts it as mentioned in the hadith ""And whomsoever Allah wills to misguide, He makes his breast tight"" with a light and emphasis from accepting it ""with difficulty"" extremely tight with a kasra on the ra' as an adjective and a fatha on it as a source of description in which there is exaggeration ""as if he were ascending"" and in one reading it is ""ascending"" and in both of them the ta' in the original is assimilated into the sad and in another with a sukoon on it ""into the sky"" if he is required to believe because of its severity on him ""Thus"" making ""Allah makes the uncleanness"" torment or Satan, meaning He sends it ""over those who do not believe"" ""And this"" which you are on, O Muhammad ""is the path"" of your Lord, straight"" with no crookedness in it and its accusative is in the state of confirmation of the sentence and the factor in it is the meaning of indication ""We have detailed"" clearly ""the verses for a people who remember"" in it the assimilation of the ta' in the original into the dhal, meaning they are admonished and they were specifically mentioned because they are the ones who benefit ""For them is the abode of peace"" meaning peace and it is Paradise ""with their Lord and He is their protector for what they used to do"""
j-0297	“And” mention “the Day We shall gather them” with the letter “nun” and “ya” meaning God’s creation “all together” and it will be said to them “O company of jinn, you have taken too much of mankind” by your misleading them “and their allies” those who obeyed them “among mankind will say, ‘Our Lord, some of us listened to others’” mankind benefited from the jinn’s beautifying their desires for them and the jinn from the obedience of mankind to them “and we have reached our term which You appointed for us” which is the Day of Resurrection. This is a regret on their part. God Almighty said to them through the tongues of the angels “The Fire is your abode” your home “to abide therein except for what God wills” of the times when they go out to drink scalding water, for he is outside of it as God Almighty said, then their return is to Hell. And from Ibn Abbas that it is about those whom God knows will believe, so what is in the meaning of “Indeed, your Lord is Wise” in His creation “Knowing” of His creation. “And thus” just as We gave enjoyment to the disobedient among mankind and jinn, some of them with others “We make some of the wrongdoers have dominion over others” that is, over others “for what they used to earn” of sins. “O company of jinn and mankind, did You not see” There will come to you messengers from among you, that is, from among you, that is, from some of you who are truthful among mankind or messengers of the jinn, their warnings are those who hear the speech of the messengers and convey it to their people, “reciting to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours. They will say, “We bear witness against ourselves,” that we have conveyed it. God Almighty said, “and the worldly life deceived them,” so they did not believe, “and they bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.” “That,” that is, sending messengers, “is because” the lam is understood and is lightened, that is, because “your Lord would not destroy the cities unjustly” among them, “while their people were heedless,” that He did not send a messenger to them to explain to them.

If it was from the males then all males are forbidden or the females then all females or what the wombs contain then the two pairs so where did the specification and questioning come from for denial? “And of camels two and of cattle two Say, “Have He forbidden the two males or the two females?

What is mentioned in the Sunnah includes every beast of prey with fangs and birds with claws. “And to those who are Jews” that is, the Jews “We have forbidden every animal with claws” that is, what does not separate its fingers like camels and ostriches “and of the cows and sheep We have forbidden them their fat” the cloven and the fat of the kidneys “except what their backs adhere to” that is, what is attached to them “or” carried by “the intestines” the plural of hawiya or hawiya “or what is mixed with a bone” from it, which is the fat of the buttocks, for it is permissible for them. “That” the prohibition “We have recompensed them” with it “for their transgression” because of their injustice in what preceded in Surat An-Nisa “and indeed, We are truthful” in Our news and promises. “But if they deny you” in what you have brought “then say” to them “your Lord is full of vast mercy” since He did not hasten to punish you and in it is gentleness in calling them to faith “and His punishment” His torment when it comes “is not repelled from the criminal people”
j-0304	“Those who associate [anything] will say, ‘If Allah had willed, we would not have associated [anything], nor would our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything. ’ So our association and our prohibition are by His will, and He is pleased with it.” God Almighty said, “Thus did those before them, their messengers, deny it until they tasted Our punishment.” Say, “Do you have any knowledge that you can bring forth for us?” That is, you have no knowledge. “You follow nothing but conjecture, and you are only guessing.” You lie about it.

And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right.’ Such as retaliation, the punishment for apostasy, and stoning a married person. ‘That’ He has enjoined upon you that you may understand. ‘And do not approach the property of an orphan except in a way that is best until he reaches maturity. ‘And give full measure and weight in justice. ‘We do not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity.’ If a person makes a mistake in measuring or weighing, Allah knows the correctness of his intentions, then he will not be held accountable, as mentioned in the hadith. ‘And if you say’ in a ruling or otherwise. “So be just” with the truth “even if” the one to whom or against whom it is said “is a relative” “and fulfill the covenant of Allah.

This was abrogated by the verse of the sword. “Whoever brings a good deed” meaning there is no god but Allah “will have ten times the like thereof” meaning the reward of ten good deeds “and whoever brings an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof” meaning his reward “and they will not be wronged” they will not be deducted from their reward in the slightest.

In it, there is a shift from the address. “O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you” that is, do not follow him, lest you be tempted “as he removed your parents” with his temptation “from Paradise, stripping them” in the state of “their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he” that is, Satan “sees you, he and his tribe” his soldiers “from where you do not see them” because of the softness of their bodies or the lack of their colors. “Indeed, We have made the devils allies” helpers and companions “for those who do not believe.”
j-0316	“And when they commit an immorality,” such as polytheism and circumambulating the House naked, saying, “We do not circumambulate in clothes in which we disobeyed God,” so they were forbidden from doing so, “they say, ‘We found our fathers doing it,’” so we followed their example, “and God has commanded us to do it,” also, “Say,” to them, “Indeed, God does not command immorality. Do you say about God that which you do not know?” That he said it is a question of denial? “Say, ‘My Lord has commanded justice,’ with fairness, “and establish,” is connected to the meaning of justice, meaning He said, “Be just and establish,” or before it, so turn, implicitly, “your faces,” toward God, “at every masjid,” meaning, devote your prostration to Him, “and call upon Him,” worship Him, “being sincere to Him in religion,” from polytheism, “as He began you,” created you when you were nothing, “you will return,” meaning, He will return you alive on the Day of Resurrection, “a party,” of you, “guided, and a party, upon whom error is due. Indeed, they have taken the devils as allies instead of God,” meaning, other than Him, “and they think that they are guided.”
j-0317	"""O children of Adam, take your adornment at every masjid, when praying and performing the Tawaf, and eat and drink as much as you wish, but be not excessive. Indeed, He does not like those who commit excess."" Say, in denunciation of them, ""Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants, of clothing, and the good things, of provision? Say, ""They are for those who believe in the worldly life, exclusively for them, in the nominative and accusative cases, on the Day of Resurrection. Thus do We detail the verses, We explain them in such detail, to a people who know, who ponder them, for they are the ones who benefit from them."" Say, ""My Lord has only forbidden immoralities, major sins such as adultery, what is apparent of them and what is concealed, and sin, disobedience, and oppression, against people, ""without right,"" which is injustice, ""and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down,"" by associating with Him, ""authority,"" proof, ""and that you say about Allah that which you do not know,"" of forbidding what He has not forbidden and other things. “And for every nation is a term” a period “so when their term comes, they will not remain behind” it “an hour, nor will they precede” it."
j-0318	“O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses, then whoever fears Allah and amends his deeds, no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.” “But those who deny Our verses and are arrogant about them, those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.” “So who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah, by attributing a partner or a child to Him, or denies His verses, the Qur’an? Those will receive, their portion, their share, of the Book, from what was written for them in the Preserved Tablet of provision, life span, and other things, until, when Our messengers come to them, that is, the angels, “taking their souls, they will say, to them, as a rebuke, ‘Where were you invoking, worshipping, other than Allah?’ They will say, ‘They have gone astray,’ ‘from Us,’ so we did not see them, ‘and they will bear witness against themselves,’ at death, ‘that they were disbelievers.’”
j-0319	“He will say” to them on the Day of Resurrection “Enter into” a sentence “nations that have passed on before you of jinn and mankind into the Fire” related to enter. “Every time a nation enters” the Fire “it will curse its sister” the one before it for its misguidance with it “until, when they overtake” they catch up “in it all together, the last of them” and they are the followers “will say to the first of them” that is, the elders of them and they are the ones being followed “Our Lord, these led us astray, so give them a double punishment” doubled “of the Fire.” He will say” to each of you and them “double” doubled punishment “but they do not know” with the ya and ta what each group has. “And the first of them will say to the last of them, “You had no superiority over us” because you did not disbelieve because of us, so we and you are equal.” God Almighty will say to them “So taste the punishment for what you used to earn.” “Indeed, those who denied Our verses and were arrogant” were arrogant “against them” so they did not believe in them “the gates of heaven will not be opened for them” when their souls ascend to them after death and descend with them to a prison, unlike the believer. It will be opened for him and his soul will ascend to the seventh heaven as mentioned in the hadith: “And they will not enter Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a needle,” the eye of a needle, which is not possible. So their entry is the same. “And thus,” the recompense, “We recompense the criminals,” for disbelief. “For them are beds of Hell,” a mattress, “and above them are coverings,” coverings of fire, plural of “ghashiyah,” and its tanween is a replacement for the deleted “yaa.” “And thus do We recompense the wrongdoers.”
j-0320	“And those who believe and do righteous deeds” is a subject, and His statement “We do not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity” is an interjection between it and its predicate, which is “those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.” “And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment” is the hatred that was between them in this world “rivers will flow beneath them” beneath their palaces “and they will say” when settling in their homes “Praise be to Allah, who has guided us to this” the work for which this is the reward “and we would not have been guided had Allah not guided us” was omitted because what preceded it indicated it “The messengers of our Lord have certainly brought the truth, and they will be called” is a lightened one, meaning that it is or is explained in the five places “This is Paradise, which you have inherited because of what you used to do”
j-0321	“And the companions of Paradise will call out to the companions of the Fire,” as a statement or a rebuke, “that we have found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised to be true?” They will say, “Yes.” Then a crier will proclaim between them, between the two groups, “that the curse of God is upon the wrongdoers,” “who avert” people “from the way of God,” His religion, “and seek it,” that is, they seek the way, “crooked,” “and are disbelievers in the Hereafter.”
j-0322	"And between them, that is, the people of Paradise and Hell, is a barrier. It is said that it is the wall of Al-A'raf. And on Al-A'raf, which is the wall of Paradise, are men whose good deeds and bad deeds are equal, as in the hadith. They recognize both the people of Paradise and Hell by their marks, by their signs, which are the whiteness of the faces of the believers and the blackness of the faces of the disbelievers, because they see them, since their position is high. And they call out to the people of Paradise, “Peace be upon you.” God Almighty said, “They did not enter it, that is, the people of Al-A'raf, Paradise, and they were hoping to enter it.” Al-Hasan said, “He did not make them hope except for the honor He wants for them.” Al-Hakim narrated from Hudhayfah, who said, “While they were like that, your Lord appeared to them and said, ‘Arise, enter Paradise, for I have forgiven you.’” “And when their eyes are turned toward the people of the Fire, they will say, “Our Lord, do not place us with the wrongdoing people.” “And the people of Al-A'raf will call out to men, from the people of Hell, whom they will recognize by their marks. They will say, “What avail you” from the Fire, “is your multitude,” wealth or your great number, “nor was your arrogance,” that is, your arrogance about faith. And they say to them, pointing to the weak. Muslims
“Are these the ones you swore would not be granted mercy by Allah?” It was said to them, “Enter Paradise, no fear shall there be concerning you, nor shall you grieve.” It was read “enter” in the passive form and “entered.” The negative sentence is a state, meaning that it was said to them that way."
j-0323	“And the companions of the Fire will call out to the companions of Paradise, ‘Pour upon us some water or whatever Allah has provided you.’ They will say, ‘Indeed, Allah has forbidden them both to the disbelievers.’ Those who took their religion as amusement and diversion and whom the worldly life deceived. So today We will forget them, We will leave them in the Fire, ‘as they forgot the meeting of this Day of theirs,’ by abandoning their work for it, ‘and they used to deny Our verses.’” That is, just as they denied
j-0324	“And We have certainly brought them” that is, the people of Mecca “a Book” the Qur’an “which We have detailed” We have explained with news, promises and threats “with knowledge” a state, that is, knowing what is detailed in it “a guidance” a state of the “ha” “and mercy for a people who believe” in it “Do they await” what they await “except its interpretation” the consequence of what is in it “On the Day its interpretation comes” that is, the Day of Resurrection “those who forgot it before” they abandoned belief in it “will say, ‘The messengers of our Lord have come with the truth, so are there for us any intercessors to intercede for us or shall we be returned” to the world “so we can do other than what we used to do” we make God one and abandon polytheism and it will be said to them, “No.” God Almighty said “They have lost their souls” since they have gone to destruction “and what they used to invent has gone away” from them
j-0325	“Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days” of the worldly days, that is, in their quantity, because there was no sun there, and if He had willed, He would have created them in a flash, and turning away from it would have taught His creation steadfastness. “Then He established Himself on the Throne” is in the language the bed of the King, an establishment befitting Him. “The night covers the day” lightened and stressed, that is, He covers each of them with the other, seeking it “rapidly” quickly. “And the sun, the moon, and the stars” in the accusative case in apposition to the heavens, and the nominative is the subject of its predicate “are subjected” submissive “by His command” by His power. “Unquestionably, His is the creation” all of it “and the command” all of it. “Blessed” in greatness, “Allah is Lord” of the worlds. “Call upon your Lord humbly” in a state of humility “and secretly” secretly “For He does not like transgressors” in supplication by pomp and raising the voice. “And do not cause corruption on the earth” with polytheism and sins “after its reformation” by sending messengers. “And call upon Him in fear” of His punishment “and hope” for His mercy. “For the mercy of Allah is near.” The doers of good are the obedient, and a reminder of the one who is informed of the mercy of God
j-0326	"“And it is He who sends the winds as scatterers before His mercy,” that is, scattered before the rain. In one reading, the shin is silent for relief, and in another, with it silent and the nun is open as a source, and in another, with it silent and the unified letter is closed instead of the nun, that is, giving good tidings. The singular of the first is nushur like rasool and the last is bashir. “Until, when they carry,” the winds carry “heavy clouds,” with rain. “We drive them,” that is, the clouds, and in this there is a shift from the third person “to a dead land,” with no vegetation, that is, to revive it. “Then We send down therein,” into the land, “water and bring forth thereby,” with the water, “of all fruits. Thus,” bringing forth, “We bring forth the dead,” from their graves by reviving, “that you may remember,” so you may believe. “And the good land,” the sweet soil, “brings forth its vegetation,” well, “by permission of its Lord,” this is an example of the believer who hears the sermon and benefits from it. “And that which is bad,” its soil, “brings forth,” its vegetation “except with difficulty,” with hardship. This is an example of the disbeliever. “Thus,” as we explained what was mentioned, “We divert,” we explain. ""The signs are for a people who are grateful"" to God and believe."

j-0341	“And” remember “when We delivered you” and in another reading, “We delivered you” “from the people of Pharaoh, who subjected you” they burdened you and made you taste “the worst of torment” the most severe of which was “killing your sons and sparing” they spared “your women, and in that” the deliverance or the torment “is a great trial” a blessing or test “from your Lord” so will you not learn a lesson and desist from what you said?
j-0342	"“And We appointed for Moses” with a thousand and less “thirty nights” We would speak to him at the end of them so that he would fast them, and they are Dhul-Qa’dah, so he fasted them, and when they were completed he disliked the bad breath from his mouth, so he used his toothpick, so God commanded him to do ten more so that He would speak to Him with the bad breath from his mouth, as God Almighty said, “And We completed them with ten” of Dhul-Hijjah “so the appointed time of his Lord was completed” the time of His promise to speak to him “forty” a state “of nights” distinguished “And Moses said to his brother Aaron” when he went to the mountain to commune “Take my place” be my successor “among my people and amend” their affairs “and do not follow the way of the corrupters” by agreeing with them in sins

“And when Moses came to Our appointed time” that is, the time in which We promised him to speak “and his Lord spoke to him” without an intermediary, a speech that he heard from every direction “he said, ‘My Lord, show me’ yourself “that I may look at You.” He said, “You will not see Me” that is, you will not be able to see Me, and the expression “I will not see” without “I will not see” indicates the possibility of seeing God Almighty “but look at the mountain” which is stronger than you “and if it remains” is fixed “in its place” “Then you will see Me” meaning, confirm my vision, otherwise you will have no power. “So when his Lord manifested Himself” meaning, a light the size of half a finger’s length appeared from His light, as in a hadith authenticated by al-Hakim. “To the mountain, He made it level” with the shortened and extended vowels, meaning, crushed and leveled with the ground. “And Moses fell unconscious” unconscious from the horror of what he saw. “And when he regained consciousness, he said, ‘Glory be to You’” glorifying You. “I repent to You” from asking for what I was not commanded to do. “And I am the first of the believers” in my time."
j-0343	“He said,” the Most High, to him, “O Moses, indeed I have chosen you,” I have selected you, “over the people,” the people of your time, “with My messages,” in the plural and singular, “and with My speech,” that is, My speaking to you, “so take what I have given you,” of grace, “and be among the grateful,” for My blessings. “And We wrote for him on the tablets,” that is, the tablets of the Torah, which were of lote-trees of Paradise or emerald or chrysolite, seven or ten, “of everything,” that he needed in religion, “an admonition and a detailed explanation,” an explanation, “of everything,” a substitute for the preposition and noun before it, “so take it,” before it, we said, implying, “with strength,” with diligence and effort, “and command your people to take the best of it. I will show you the home of the wicked,” Pharaoh and his followers, which is Egypt, so that you may take heed from them.
j-0344	"“I will turn away from My signs” the signs of My power from the created things and other things “those who are arrogant upon the earth without right” by abandoning them so that they do not act arrogantly therein “and if they see every sign they will not believe in it and if they see the path” the path “of right guidance” the guidance that came from God “they will not take it as a path” to follow it “and if they see the path of error” misguidance “they will take it as a path. That” the turning away “is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them” a similar example has come before
“and those who deny Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter” the resurrection and other things “their deeds have become worthless” the good deeds they did in this world such as maintaining family ties and charity, so they will have no reward because its condition is not met. “Are they recompensed except for what they used to do” of denial and sins?"
j-0345	“And the people of Moses took after him” that is, after he went to the intimate conversation “from their ornaments” which they borrowed from the people of Pharaoh for the sake of a wedding, and it remained with them “a calf” which the Samaritan fashioned for them from it “a body” instead of flesh and blood “having a lowing” that is, a sound that could be heard, which was transformed in this way by placing the dust that he took from the hoof of Gabriel’s horse in its mouth, for its effect is life in what it is placed in. The second object of “took” is omitted, that is, a god. “Did they not see that it does not speak to them nor guide them to a way?” So how could it be taken as a god? “They took it” as a god “and were wrongdoers” by taking it. “And when it fell into their hands” that is, they regretted worshipping it “and they saw” they knew “that they had gone astray” by it, and that was after Moses returned “and they said, ‘If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us’” with the ya and ta in them “we will surely be among the losers.”
j-0346	"“And when Moses returned to his people, angry” at them “with sorrow” deeply grieved “he said” “How evil is” that is, how evil is the succession “you have succeeded me” after me “this succession of yours where you have associated partners with Allah”. “You hastened the command of your Lord!” And he threw down the tablets” the tablets of the Torah in anger at his Lord, so they were broken “and seized his brother by the head” that is, his hair with his right hand and his beard with his left “dragging him towards him” in anger “he said” “O son of my mother” with a kasra on the meem and a fatha on it, he meant my mother and he mentioned her in a way that was more affectionate towards him “the people have weakened me and have almost killed me, so do not let the enemies rejoice over me” by humiliating me “and do not place me with the wrongdoing people” by worshipping the calf in the punishment

“He said: My Lord, forgive me” what I did to my brother “and my brother” he associated him in the supplication to please him and to prevent rejoicing over him “and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful” God Almighty said

“Indeed, those who took the calf” as a god “They will be afflicted with wrath” torment “from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world” so they were punished by being ordered to kill themselves and humiliation was imposed upon them until the Day of Resurrection. “And thus” as We punished them “We punish the slanderers” against God by associating partners with God and other things. “And those who have committed evil deeds and then repented” turned away from them “afterwards and believed” in God “indeed, your Lord, after that” that is, repentance “is Forgiving” of them “and Merciful” to them."
j-0347	“And when Moses’ anger subsided, he took up the tablets, which he had thrown down, and in their copy, that is, what was copied in them, that is, he wrote, was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord.” He added the lam to the object because it preceded it. “And Moses chose from his people, that is, from his people, seventy men, from those who did not worship the calf, by His command, “for Our appointed time,” that is, the time in which We promised them that they would come so that they would apologize for their companions’ worship of the calf, so he went out with them. “But when the earthquake seized them,” the severe quake, Ibn Abbas said, because they did not leave their people when they worshipped the calf. He said, “And they were not those who asked for the vision and were seized by the thunderbolt, he said, ‘My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed them before,’ that is, before I went out with them so that the Children of Israel could witness that and not accuse Me, “and me. Will You destroy us for what the fools among us have done?” This is a question of sympathy, that is, do not punish us for the sin of someone other than us. “If” what “it is,” that is, the trial in which he fell. The fools “except your trial” your test “with which you mislead whom you will” misguide him “and guide whom you will” his guidance “You are our protector” the one who takes charge of our affairs “so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and you are the best of forgivers” “and decree” and answer “for us in this world that which is good and in the Hereafter” good “for we have been guided” we have repented “to you” He said, the Most High, “My punishment - I afflict with it whom I will” his punishment “and My mercy encompasses” encompasses “all things” in this world “so I will decree it” in the Hereafter “for those who fear God and give zakah and those who believe in Our verses”
j-0348	“Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered Prophet,” Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel,” with his name and description, “who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things,” of what is forbidden in their law, “and prohibits for them the bad things,” such as dead meat and the like, “and removes from them their burden,” their burden, “and the shackles,” the hardships, “which were upon them,” such as killing a soul out of repentance and cutting off the traces of impurity. “So those who believe in him,” among them, “and honor him,” and respect him, “and support him and follow the light which has been sent down with him,” that is, the Qur’an, “those are the successful.” “Say,” addressing the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of God to you all, to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no god except Him; He gives life and causes death. So believe in God and His Messenger, the unlettered Prophet, who believes in God and His words,” the Qur’an, “and follow him that you may be guided,” that you may be guided.
j-0349	“And among the people of Moses was a community” a group “guiding” people “with the truth and thereby acting justly” in judgment. “And We divided them” We divided the Children of Israel “into twelve” a state “tribes” a substitute for it, meaning tribes “nations” a substitute for what preceded it. “And We inspired Moses when his people asked him for water” in the wilderness “to strike the rock with your staff” so he struck it “and there gushed forth” from it twelve springs” according to the number of the tribes. “Every people” a tribe of them “knew their drinking place. And We shaded them with clouds” in the wilderness from the heat of the sun “and We sent down upon them manna and quails” they are the taranjabin and the quail with a lightened and shortened “mim” and We said to them “Eat from the good things We have provided for you. And they did not wrong Us, but they were wronging themselves.” “And” remember “when it was said to them, ‘Dwell in this city’” Jerusalem “and eat from it wherever you wish and say” We commanded “forgiveness and enter the gate’” meaning the gate of the city “prostrating” prostration of bowing. “We forgive” with the letter “nun” and the letter “ta” indicating the object “for you your sins. We will increase the reward of the righteous” through obedience. “But those who did wrong among them substituted a statement other than that which was said to them” so they said “a grain in a hair” and they entered crawling on their buttocks. “So We sent upon them a punishment” a torment “from the sky because they were wronging.”
j-0350	“And ask them,” O Muhammad, as a rebuke, “about the town that was by the sea,” adjacent to the Red Sea, and it was Ayla, what happened to its people, “when they transgressed,” transgressed “on the Sabbath,” by catching fish that they were commanded to leave there, “when,” an adverb for “when they transgressed,” “their fish came to them on their Sabbath day lawfully,” visible on the water, “and on a day when they did not observe the Sabbath,” they did not honor the Sabbath, that is, on all other days, “they did not come to them,” as a trial from God, “thus do We test them,” for what they were defiantly doing.” And when they caught the fish, the town was divided into thirds, a third of whom they caught, a third of whom they forbade, and a third of whom refrained from fishing.
j-0351	"""And when"" is in apposition to ""when"" before it ""a group of them said"" they did not turn away or forbid those who forbade ""Why do you preach to a people whom Allah is about to destroy or punish with a severe punishment? They said"" our preaching ""an excuse"" we apologize with it ""to your Lord"" so that we will not be accused of negligence in abandoning the prohibition ""and perhaps they will fear"" hunting. ""But they did not forget"" they abandoned ""what they had remembered"" they were preached ""with"" so they did not return ""We saved those who forbade evil and seized those who did wrong"" by transgression ""with a wretched punishment"" severe ""because they were defiantly disobedient"" ""But when they rebelled"" were arrogant ""from"" abandoning ""what they were forbidden We said to them, ""Be apes, despised"" humiliated, so they were them. This is a detail of what came before it. Ibn Abbas said I do not know what was done with the silent group. Ikrimah said they were not destroyed because they hated what they did and said why do you preach"" etc. Al-Hakim narrated from Ibn Abbas that he returned to it and he was amazed."
j-0352	"“And when you proclaimed,” I informed, “your Lord would surely send against them,” meaning the Jews, “until the Day of Resurrection those who would subject them to the worst of punishment,” by humiliation and taking the jizya. So He sent against them Solomon and after him Bukhtanasr, who killed them and took them captive and imposed the jizya on them, so they would pay it to the Magians until He sent our Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and imposed it on them. “Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty,” for those who disobeyed Him. “And indeed, He is Forgiving,” to those who obeyed Him. “Merciful,” to them. “And We divided them,” We dispersed them, “in the land into nations,” groups, “among them were the righteous and among them,” people, “beyond that,” the disbelievers and the wicked. “And We tested them with good,” blessings, “and evil,” punishments, “that perhaps they might return,” from their wickedness. “Then there came after them an evil generation who inherited the Scripture,” the Torah from their fathers, “taking the goods of this lower world,” meaning the debris of this lowly thing, meaning the world, of what is lawful and unlawful, “and saying, ‘He will forgive us,’” for what we did for us. “And if a similar goods come to them, they take it,” the clause is a state, meaning they hope. Forgiveness, and they are returning to what they did, insisting on it, and there is no promise of forgiveness in the Torah with insistence. “Has not the covenant of the Book been taken from them?” The addition means in “that they will not say about God except the truth, and they have studied” is in apposition to “is taken” they read “what is in it” so why did they lie about it by attributing forgiveness to him with insistence “and the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear God” the forbidden “do they not understand” with the ya and the ta that it is better so they prefer it over the world “and those who hold fast” with emphasis and lightening “to the Book” from them “and establish prayer” like Abdullah bin Salam and his companions “indeed We do not allow to be lost the reward of the righteous” the sentence is the news of those and in it the apparent is placed in place of the implied, meaning their reward
“and” “when We raised the mountain” raised it from its base “above them as if it were a canopy and they thought” were certain “that it was going to fall upon them” falling upon them by God’s promise to them that it would fall if they did not accept the rulings of the Torah and they were its father because of its weight, so they reversed and We said to them “take what We have given you strength, with hard work and diligence. Remember what is in it, that you may become righteous."
j-0353	"“And” mention “when” when “your Lord took from the children of Adam, from their loins” in apposition to what preceded it by returning the preposition “their descendants” by bringing some of them out from the loins of others from the loins of Adam, offspring after offspring, similar to what they reproduce like the offspring of Nu’man on the Day of Arafah, and He established for them proofs of His Lordship and installed in them intellect “and made them testify of themselves” He said “Am I not your Lord?” They said, “Yes,” you are our Lord “We testify” to that, and the testifying is for “not” “they say” with the ya’ and the ta’ in both places, meaning the disbelievers “on the Day of Resurrection, ‘Indeed, we were of this’ monotheism “unaware,” we do not know it “or they say, ‘It was only our fathers who associated others with Allah before,’ meaning before us, “and we were descendants after them,” so we followed their example “Then will You destroy us” punish us “for what the falsifiers did” from our fathers by establishing polytheism? The meaning is that they cannot argue with that while they testify of themselves to monotheism and the reminder of it on the tongue of the one who has the miracle takes the place of mentioning it in the souls
“And thus do We detail” Verses: “We explain them as We explained the covenant, so that they may reflect upon them, and perhaps they will return” from their disbelief."
j-0354	“And recite to them,” O Muhammad, “the news,” that is, the Jews, “the story of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he slipped out of them,” he came out in his disbelief as a snake emerges from its skin, and he is Balaam bin Ba’oura, one of the scholars of the Children of Israel. He was asked to invoke Allah against Moses, and something was presented to him, so he invoked Allah, but it turned against him, his tongue sticking out on his chest. “So Satan pursued him,” so he overtook him and became his companion, “and he was among the deviators.” “And if We had willed, We could have raised him up,” to the ranks of the scholars, “therein,” by stopping him to work, “but he clung to the earth,” that is, the world, and inclined toward it, “and followed his own desire,” in calling to it, so We put him down. “So his example,” his description, “is like that of the dog: if you chase him,” by driving him away and reprimanding him, “he pants,” he sticks out his tongue, “or if you leave him, he pants,” and no other animal is like that. The two clauses of the condition are a state, that is, panting and humiliated in every state, and the intention is to liken the situation and the baseness with the indication of the fa’ indicating the arrangement of what comes after it with what comes before it of inclination toward the world. And following desires and with the evidence of His saying “that” the example “is the example of the people who denied Our signs, so relate the story” to the Jews “that they may give thought” ponder over it and believe. “Evil” how bad “is the example of the people” that is, the example of the people “who denied Our signs and were wronging themselves” by denying. “He whom Allah guides is the one who is guided, and he whom He sends astray - those are the losers.”
j-0355	“And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, and they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear.” The signs and sermons are hearing, contemplation, and admonition. “Those are like livestock,” in their lack of understanding, sight, and listening. “Rather, they are more astray,” than livestock, because they seek its benefits and flee from its harms. These people are advancing toward the Fire in defiance. “Those are the heedless.”
j-0356	“And to God belong the best names,” the ninety-nine mentioned in the hadith. “The best” is the feminine of “the best.” “So invoke Him,” call Him, “by them and leave,” abandon, “those who deviate” from “alhad” and “lahd” deviate from the truth, “concerning His names,” where they derived names for their gods from them, such as “al-Lat” from “Allah,” “al-Uzza” from “al-Aziz,” and “Manat” from “al-Mannan.” “They will be recompensed,” in the Hereafter, for what they used to do,” and this was before the command to fight.
j-0357	"""And among those We have created is a nation who guide with the truth and do justice thereby"" They are the nation of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, as in the hadith

""And those who deny Our signs"" the Qur'an from the people of Mecca ""We will gradually seize them"" We will take them little by little ""from where they do not know""

""And I will grant them respite"" I will grant them respite ""Indeed, My plan is firm"" severe and unbearable

""Have they not reflected"" so that they may know ""What is in their companion"" Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace ""of madness"" madness ""Indeed, he is only a clear warner"" between the warning

""Have they not considered the dominion"" the dominion ""of the heavens and the earth"" and in ""what Allah has created of anything"" an explanation of what they can use to prove the power of its Creator and His Oneness ""And"" in ""that"" meaning that ""Perhaps their term has drawn near"" so that they die as disbelievers and are sent to the Fire, so they hasten to believe ""So in what statement after it"" meaning the Qur'an ""will they believe?""

""He whom Allah sends astray, there is no guide for him, and He leaves them"" with the letter ya and the letter nun with the nominative Resuming and the jussive mood is in apposition to the position of what comes after the letter “fa” “in their transgression they wander blindly” they hesitate in confusion"
j-0358	They ask you, that is, the people of Mecca, about the Hour, the Resurrection, “when” when “it will arrive.” Say, to them, “Its knowledge is only with my Lord. None will reveal it at its time except Him. It is heavy, immense, in the heavens and the earth,” for its people because of its terror. “It will not come upon you except suddenly.” They ask you as if you were anxious, exaggerating in your question, “about it,” until you know it. “Say, ‘Its knowledge is only with God,’” emphasis, “but most people do not know,” that its knowledge is with Him, the Most High.
j-0359	“Say, ‘I do not possess for myself any benefit or harm except what Allah wills. If I knew the unseen, I would have acquired much good, and no harm would have touched me. I am only a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe.’”
j-0360	“He” meaning God “is the One Who created you from one soul” meaning Adam “and made” he created “from it its mate” Eve “that he might dwell in tranquility with her” and be intimate with her. “And when he covered her” had intercourse with her “she conceived a light burden” meaning the sperm “and passed by it” she went and came because of its lightness “and when it became heavy” due to the size of the child in her womb and they feared that it would be an animal “they called upon God, their Lord, ‘If You give us’ a good child, we will surely be among the grateful’ to you for it. “And when He gave them both a good child, they ascribed to Him partners” and in a reading with a kasra on the shin and the tanween, meaning a partner “in what He gave them” by naming him ‘Abd al-Harith, and it is not appropriate for a slave to be except to God, and it is not a partnership in servitude due to the infallibility of Adam. Samurah narrated on the authority of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he said: When Eve gave birth, Satan went around her and she did not have a child who lived, so he said: Name him ‘Abd al-Harith, for he will live’ so she named him and he lived, and that was from the inspiration and command of Satan. Narrated by al-Hakim, who said it is authentic, and by al-Tirmidhi. Hasan Gharib said: “So exalted is Allah above what they associate” meaning the people of Mecca with Him of idols. The sentence is a cause in apposition to your creation and what is between them is an interruption. “Do they associate” with Him in worship “those who create nothing and are themselves created?” “And they are not able to help them” meaning their worshippers “nor can they help themselves” by preventing them from those who want to harm them by breaking or other things. The question is for rebuke. “And if you call them” meaning the idols “to guidance, they will not follow you” with the light and heavy “it is the same for you whether you call them” to it “or are you silent” about their call, they will not follow it because they do not hear. “Indeed, those you call upon” you worship “besides Allah are servants” owned “like you, so call upon them and let them respond to you” your call “if you should be truthful” in that they are gods. Then he explained the extent of their inability and the superiority of their worshippers over them, saying: “Do they have feet with which to walk, or” rather, “have they hands” plural of hand “with which to strike, or” rather, “have they ears with which to hear” a rhetorical question, meaning they do not have any of that which is For you, how do you worship them while you are in a state of separation from them? “Say” to them, O Muhammad, “Call upon your partners” to my destruction “then plot, and do not give me respite” give me respite, for I do not care about you.
j-0361	“My protector is Allah,” the One who takes care of my affairs, “who has sent down the Book,” the Qur’an, “and He takes care of the righteous,” by preserving it. “And those you call upon besides Him cannot help you, nor can they help themselves,” so how can I care about them? “And if you call them,” meaning the idols, “to guidance, they do not hear, and you see them,” meaning the idols, O Muhammad, “looking at you,” meaning they face you as one looks, “while they do not see.”
j-0362	"""Take what is easy"" is the ease of people's morals and do not search for it ""and enjoin what is right"" with what is right ""and turn away from the ignorant"" do not meet them with their foolishness ""and if"" in it is the assimilation of the nun of the conditional ""in"" in the additional ""and if an evil suggestion from Satan incites you"" that is, if someone turns you away from what you were commanded to do ""then seek refuge in Allah"" the answer to the condition and the answer to the command are omitted, that is, He repels it from you ""for He is All-Hearing"" of the statement ""and All-Knowing"" of the action ""indeed, those who fear Allah - when a phantom touches them"" afflicts them - in the reading of ""ta'if"" meaning anything that afflicts them ""from Satan, they remember"" the punishment of Allah and His reward ""and at once they see"" the truth from other than it, so they return ""and their brothers"" that is, the brothers of the devils from the disbelievers ""prolong them"" that is, the devils ""in error, then"" they ""do not fall short"" they refrain from it with insight as the righteous see ""and when you do not bring them"" that is, the people of Mecca ""a sign"" of what they suggested ""they say, ""Why"" why did you not ""choose it"" created it on your own ""say"" They said, “I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord.” It is not for me to bring anything of my own accord. “This,” the Qur’an, “is insights,” arguments, “from your Lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe.”"
j-0363	“And when the Qur’an is recited, listen to it and be silent that you may receive mercy.” It was revealed about refraining from speaking during the sermon, and it was referred to as the Qur’an because it includes it. It was also said about reciting the Qur’an in general. “And remember your Lord within yourself,” that is, secretly, “in humility,” in coquetry, “and in fear,” in fear of Him, “and” above secretly, “without speaking aloud,” that is, intentionally between them, “in the mornings and the evenings,” the beginnings and ends of the day, “and be not among the heedless,” of the remembrance of God. “Indeed, those who are with your Lord,” that is, the angels, “are not too proud,” are too proud, “to worship Him, and they glorify Him,” they declare Him free from what is not befitting of Him, “and to Him they prostrate,” that is, they single Him out in submission and worship, so be like them.
j-0364	«They ask you» O Muhammad «about the spoils» the spoils of war, to whom they belong «Say» to them «The spoils belong to God» He makes them wherever He wills «and the Messenger» He distributes them by God’s command, so the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, distributed them among them equally. Al-Hakim narrated it in Al-Mustadrak «So fear God and amend that which is between you» that is, the reality of what is between you through love and avoiding dispute «and obey God and His Messenger, if you are believers» truly «The believers» those with complete faith «are only those who, when God is mentioned» that is, His threat «their hearts become fearful» fearful «and when His verses are recited to them, it increases their faith» belief «and upon their Lord they rely» they trust in Him and not in anyone else «Those who establish prayer» they perform it with its due rights «and spend out of what We have provided them» We have given them «in obedience to God». «Those» those described by what was mentioned «are the believers in truth» truly without a doubt «for them are degrees» homes in Paradise «with their Lord and forgiveness and generous provision» in Paradise
j-0365	"""Just as your Lord brought you out from your home with truth"" is related to brought out ""and indeed a party of the believers were averse"", the exit and the clause are a state of the kaf brought you out, and as is the predicate of a deleted subject, meaning this state of their aversion to it is like your expulsion in the state of their aversion, and it was better for them, so it is also like that. That is because Abu Sufyan brought a camel from Ash-Sham, so the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and his companions went out to seize it, and the Quraysh knew, so Abu Jahl and the fighters of Mecca went out to defend it, and they were the mobilization, and Abu Sufyan took the camel along the coast, so it was saved, so it was said to Abu Jahl, go back, but he refused and went to Badr, so the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, consulted his companions and said, God has promised me one of the two parties, so they agreed with him to fight the mobilization, and some of them hated that and said, we have not prepared for it, as God Almighty said

""They argue with you about the truth"", the fighting ""after it has become clear"", became apparent to them ""as if they were being driven to death while they are looking"" at it clearly in their aversion to it

""And"" remember ""when God promised you one of the two parties"", the caravan or the mobilization ""that it would be yours, and you would love"" You want “that the one without power” meaning the might and weapons, which is the caravan “be yours” because of its small number and its supplies, unlike the mobilization “and God wants to establish the truth” to appear “with His words” previous to the appearance of Islam “and to cut off the root of the disbelievers” the last of them by extermination, so He commanded you to fight the mobilization “so that the truth may be established and falsehood” disbelief “may be averse, even though the criminals” the polytheists hate that."
j-0366	Remember, “When you sought help from your Lord,” asking Him for help with victory over them, “and He responded to you, ‘I will reinforce you,’” meaning, “with a thousand angels, one after the other,” one after the other, one after the other. He promised them at first, then it became three thousand, then five, as in Al-Imran. It was read with an alif, like aflas, the plural of “falas.” “And God did not make it,” meaning the reinforcement, “except as good tidings and that your hearts might be reassured thereby. And victory is not but from God. Indeed, God is Exalted in Might and Wise.” Remember, “When drowsiness overtakes you, as security,” security from what you have experienced of fear “from Him,” the Most High, “and He sends down upon you from the sky water to purify you thereby,” from ritual impurities and impurities, “and to remove from you the defilement of Satan,” his whispering to you that if you were on the truth, you would not have been thirsty and intoxicated, and the polytheists are on the water, “and to bind,” to restrain, “your hearts,” with certainty and patience, “and to plant firmly thereby your feet,” lest they sink into the sand. “When your Lord inspired to the angels,” with whom He reinforced the Muslims, “that I will” That is, that I am “with you” with help and victory “so strengthen those who believe” with help and good tidings “I will cast terror” fear “so strike above the necks” meaning the heads “and strike from them every fingertip” meaning the tips of the hands and feet. So a man intended to strike the neck of the disbeliever so that it would fall before his sword reached him. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, threw a handful of pebbles at them, and there was not a single polytheist left but that some of it entered his eyes, so they were defeated. “That” is the punishment that will befall them “because they opposed” disobeyed “Allah and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger, then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty” for him. “That” is the punishment “so taste it” O disbelievers in this world “and indeed for the disbelievers” in the Hereafter “is the punishment of the Fire.”
j-0367	“O you who have believed, when you meet those who disbelieve advancing,” that is, gathered together as if they were advancing because of their great numbers, “do not turn your backs to them,” in defeat. “And whoever turns his back to them that day,” that is, the day of their encounter, “unless turning aside,” turning back, “to fight,” by showing them the surprise of a plot while he wants to attack, “or withdrawing,” joining “a company,” a group of Muslims seeking their help, “has incurred,” has turned back, “in wrath from Allah, and his refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.” The reference is this, and this is specific to those who do not exceed weakness in the disbelievers.
j-0368	“You did not kill them” at Badr with your strength “but Allah killed them” by giving you victory “and you did not throw” O Muhammad, at the eyes of the people “when you threw” with pebbles because a handful of pebbles does not fill the eyes of a large army with a human throw “but Allah threw” by delivering that to them. He did that to subdue the disbelievers “and to test the believers from Him with a good test” a gift “that is the spoils”. “Indeed Allah is Hearing” of their words “Knowing” of their conditions “that” the test is true “and indeed Allah weakens” weakens “the plot of the disbelievers”. “If you seek victory” O disbelievers, if you seek victory, that is, the decree, as Abu Jahl among you said, “O Allah, which of us is more detached from the Most Merciful and brings us what we do not know, then destroy him this morning” that is, destroy him “then victory has come to you” the decree of destroying the one who is like that, and he is Abu Jahl and those killed with him apart from the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the believers “and if you desist” from disbelief and war “it is better for you, but if you return” to fighting the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace And he said, “We promise” to support you, “but your groups will not avail you at all, even if they are many. And indeed, God is with the believers,” with the kasra of “in” as a resumption, and its fatha is based on the estimation of “lam.”
j-0369	"""O you who believe! Obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you listen"" to the Qur'an and the sermons. ""And be not like those who say, 'We hear,' while they do not listen"", listening to ponder and learn from admonition, and they are the hypocrites or polytheists. ""Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allah are the deaf"" from hearing the truth ""and the dumb"" from speaking it ""who do not use reason."" 

""And if Allah had known any good in them"" righteousness through hearing the truth ""He would have made them hear"" hearing to understand.

""O you who believe! Respond to Allah and the Messenger"" by obedience ""when he calls you to that which gives you life"" of the matter of religion, that it is the cause of eternal life.

""And fear Allah."" “A trial, if it befalls you, will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively,” but will include them and others. You can avoid it by denying its cause of evil. “And know that God is severe in penalty,” for those who oppose Him. “And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land,” the land of Mecca, “fearing that people might snatch you away,” the infidels would quickly seize you. “So He gave you shelter,” to Medina, “and supported you,” strengthened you, “with His victory,” on the day of Badr with the angels, “and provided you with good things,” the spoils, “that you might be grateful,” for His blessings."
j-0370	And it was revealed about Abu Lubabah Marwan bin Abdul Mundhir, whom the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, had sent to Qurayza to submit to his judgment. They consulted him, and he indicated to them that it was slaughter because his family and wealth were among them. “O you who have believed, do not betray God and the Messenger or betray your trusts” what you have been entrusted with of religion and other things “while you know.” “And know that your wealth and your children are but a trial” to distract you from the affairs of the Hereafter “and that God has with Him a great reward” so do not miss it by taking care of your wealth and children and betraying them for their sake. And it was revealed about his repentance: “O you who have believed, if you fear God” by turning to God and other things “He will make for you a criterion” between you and what you fear, so you will be saved “and will remove from you your misdeeds and forgive you” your sins “and God is the possessor of great bounty.”
j-0371	"“And remember, O Muhammad, when those who disbelieved plotted against you” when they had gathered to consult about you in the House of Assembly “to confine you” to tie you up and imprison you “or kill you” all of them were the killers of one man “or expel you” from Mecca “and they plotted” against you “and Allah plotted” against them by planning your affair by revealing to you what they planned and ordering you to leave “and Allah is the best of plotters” He knows best about it. “And when Our verses” the Qur’an “are recited to them, they say, ‘We have heard. If we willed, we could say the like of this’” said al-Nadr ibn al-Harith because he used to come to al-Hirah to trade and buy books about the news of the non-Arabs and tell them to the people of Mecca “this” the Qur’an “is nothing but legends” lies “of the ancients”
“And when they said, ‘O Allah, if this’ what Muhammad recites “is the truth” revealed “from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment’” painful for denying it, said by al-Nasr and others in mockery and to give the impression that he had insight and determination By its invalidity
God Almighty said: “And God would not punish them” for what they asked “while you are among them” because when punishment descends, it is general and no nation is punished except after the exit of its Prophet and the believers from it “And God would not punish them while they seek forgiveness” as they say in their circumambulation, “Your forgiveness, your forgiveness.” And it was said that they are the weak believers among them as God Almighty said: “If they had separated, We would have punished those who disbelieved among them with a painful punishment.” “And what is the matter with them” that “God should not punish them” with the sword after the exit of you and the weak ones, and according to the first opinion, it abrogates what came before it, and God punished them at Badr and other times “while they avert” they prevent the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and the Muslims “from the Sacred Mosque” from circumambulating it “and they are not its guardians” as they claimed “Indeed” what “its guardians are only the righteous, but most of them do not know” that they have no guardianship over it
“And their prayer at the House was nothing but whistling” whistling “and clapping” meaning they made that the place of their prayer that they were commanded to do “so taste the punishment” at Badr “for what they were commanded to do” ""You were disbelieving."" ""Indeed, those who disbelieve spend their wealth"" in the war against the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, ""to avert [people] from the way of God.

j-0372	“Say to those who disbelieve,” such as Abu Sufyan and his companions, “If they cease,” from disbelief and fighting the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “what has previously occurred will be forgiven them,” of their deeds. “But if they return,” to fighting, “the precedent of the former peoples has already passed,” that is, our precedent with them in destroying them, so we will do the same to them. “And fight them until there is no more fitnah,” polytheism, “and religion is all for God,” alone, and no one else is worshipped. “But if they cease,” from disbelief, “then indeed, God is Seeing of what they do,” so He will reward them for it. “But if they turn away,” from faith, “then know that God is your Protector,” your helper and the one who takes care of your affairs. “An excellent Protector,” He is, “and an excellent Helper,” that is, your Helper.
j-0373	“And know that whatever you gain” that you take from the infidels by force “of anything, a fifth of it is for Allah” He commands what He wills “and for the Messenger and for the near relatives” the relatives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, from Banu Hashim and Banu al-Muttalib “and the orphans” the children of the Muslims whose fathers died while they were poor “and the needy” the needy among the Muslims “and the wayfarer” the one stranded on his journey among the Muslims, meaning the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and the four categories are entitled to it according to what he used to divide, that for each fifth a fifth and the remaining four fifths are for the conquerors “if you have believed in Allah” then do that “and what” in apposition to Allah “We sent down upon Our servant” Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, of the angels and the signs “on the Day of Discrimination” that is, the Day of Badr, the distinction between truth and falsehood “the day the two armies met” the Muslims and the infidels “and Allah is over all things competent” and from it He gave you victory despite your fewness and their greatness
j-0374	“When” instead of “day” “you” are “on the lower side of the valley” the one closest to the city, and it is with a damma or kasra on the ‘ayn, the side of the valley “and they are on the farthest side” the one farther from it “and the caravan” the camel is located in a place “lower than you” which is next to the sea “and if you had made an appointment” you and the mobilization for fighting “you would have differed about the appointment, but” He gathered you without an appointment “that Allah might accomplish a matter that was to be done” in His knowledge, which is the victory of Islam and the eradication of disbelief, He did that “so that he who perishes will perish” disbelieve “with clear evidence” that is after a clear proof was established for him, which is the victory of the believers despite their small number over the large army “and he who lives will live” believe “with clear evidence. And indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.” Remember “when Allah showed them to you in your sleep” that is, your sleep “as few” so you informed your companions about it and they interpreted it “and if He had shown them to you as many, you would have failed” you would have been cowardly “and you would have disputed” you would have differed “about the matter” the matter of fighting “but Allah saved” how much failure and dispute “for He is Knowing” “With what is in the hearts” “And when He showed them to you” O believers “when you met, as few in your eyes” about seventy or a hundred, and they are a thousand, so that you advance upon them “and He made you seem small in their eyes” so that they advance and do not turn back from fighting you. This was before the war began, so when it began, He showed them twice their number, as in Al Imran “that God may accomplish a matter which was to be done. And to God are matters returned” they come to pass.
j-0375	"""O you who believe! When you meet a company, a disbelieving group, then stand firm, to fight them and do not be defeated, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful, to win. And obey Allah and His Messenger, and do not dispute, differ among yourselves, lest you lose heart, become cowardly, and your strength departs, and be patient. Indeed, Allah is with the patient, with victory and support. And do not be like those who went forth from their homes, in arrogance and to be seen by people, when they said, ""We will not return until we drink wine and slaughter camels and the female singers play for us at Badr, so that people may hear about that, and avert, people, from the way of Allah. And Allah encompasses, with knowledge, what they do, so He will reward them for it. And remember, when Satan, Iblis, made their deeds seem good to them, when he encouraged them to meet the Muslims when they feared to go out from their enemies, Banu Bakr, and said, to them, ""No one can overcome you this Day."" “Of the people, and I am your protector” from Kinanah, and he had come to them in the form of Suraqa ibn Malik, the master of that region. “But when the two parties” the Muslims and the unbelievers saw each other, and the angels saw his hand in the hand of al-Harith ibn Hisham, “he turned back” “on his heels” fleeing “and said” when they said to him, “Shall we desert us in this state?” “Indeed, I am innocent of you” from your protector. “Indeed, I see what you do not see” from the angels. “Indeed, I fear Allah” that He would destroy me. “And Allah is severe in penalty.” “When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease” weak belief “these” meaning the Muslims “have been deceived by their religion” when they went out with their killing to fight the great multitude, imagining that they would be victorious because of it.” God Almighty said in response to them. “And whoever relies upon Allah” trusts in Him, he will be victorious. “Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might” dominant over His affair, “Wise” in His creation."
j-0376	“And if you could but see,” O Muhammad, “when the angels take the souls” with the letter “ya” and the letter “ta” “of those who disbelieve” with iron clubs “and” say to them “Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire” meaning the Fire. The answer to “if you could see” is a terrible matter. “That” the punishment “is for what your hands have put forth” he used it and not others because most actions are performed with it “and that God is not unjust” meaning unjust “to the servants” so he punishes them without sin.
j-0377	These people were “like the habit” of “the people of Pharaoh and those before them who disbelieved in the signs of God, so God seized them” with punishment “for their sins” the phrase “disbelieved” and what follows it explain what came before it “God is powerful” in what He wants “severe in penalty” “that” meaning the punishment of the disbelievers “because” meaning because “God would not change a favor which He had bestowed upon a people” exchanging it for punishment “until they change what is in themselves” exchanging their favor for disbelief like the disbelievers of Mecca exchanging their food for hunger and their security for fear and sending the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, to them with disbelief and turning people away from the path of God and fighting the believers “and God is Hearing and Knowing” “like the habit of the people of Pharaoh and those before them who denied the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their sins and drowned the people of Pharaoh” his people with him “and all” of the nations who denied “were wrongdoers”
j-0378	And it was revealed about Qurayzah: “Indeed, the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who disbelieve, so they will not believe.” “Those among you with whom you have made a covenant” not to aid the polytheists “and then break their covenant every time” they made a covenant “and they do not fear” Allah in their treachery. “So if” in it is the assimilation of the conditional “nun” of “in” into the additional “ma” “you come upon them” you find them “in war, then scatter” separate “those behind them” of the combatants by tormenting them and punishing them “that they” that is, those behind them “may remember” take heed from them. “But if you fear treachery from a people” who have made a covenant with you “then throw” throw away their covenant “to them on equal terms” in the state of being equal, you and them in knowledge of the broken covenant by informing them of it so that they do not accuse you of treachery “for Allah does not love the treacherous.” And it was revealed about those who escaped on the day of Badr “And do not think” O Muhammad “that those who disbelieve have outstripped” Allah, that is, have come upon Him “for they do not They are unable to miss it. In a reading with the lower letter, the first object is omitted, meaning themselves. In another reading with the opening of “in” on the assumption of “lam”. And prepare for them to fight them whatever you are able of power. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: It is archery. Narrated by Muslim. And from the tying of horses is a source meaning to keep them in the way of God. You terrify, you frighten with it the enemy of God and your enemy, meaning the infidels of Mecca and others besides them, meaning other than them, and they are the hypocrites or the Jews. You do not know them. God knows them. And whatever you spend in the way of God, He will fully repay you for it, and you will not be wronged. You will not reduce anything from it. “And if they incline” incline “to peace” with the kasra of the seen and its opening, peace “then incline to it” and make a covenant with them. Ibn Abbas said this was abrogated by the verse of the sword. Mujahid said it was specific to the People of the Book since it was revealed about Banu Qurayzah. “And rely upon God” trust in Him. “Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing” of the statement “the Knowing” of the action.
j-0379	"""And if they intend to deceive you"" with a peace treaty to prepare against you ""then sufficient for you"" is Allah. It is He who supported you with His victory and with the believers""

""And united"" gathered ""their hearts"" after the grudges ""If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have united their hearts. But Allah united them"" with His power ""For He is Exalted in Might"" dominant in His affair ""Wise"" nothing goes beyond His wisdom

""O Prophet, sufficient for you is Allah and"" sufficient for you ""those who follow you of the believers""

""O Prophet, urge"" urge ""the believers to fight"" the disbelievers ""If there are twenty among you, patient, they will overcome two hundred"" of them ""And if there are"" with the letter ya and the letter ta ""among you, a hundred will overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve because"" that is, because they ""are a people who do not understand"" and this is a report with the meaning of a command, that is, let the twenty among you fight the two hundred and the one hundred thousand and prove themselves to them. Then it was abrogated when they became many by His saying

""Now Allah has lightened your burden and knows that there is weakness in you"" with the letter ḍād with a ḍammah and a fathah about fighting ten Likes of you. “If there are” with the letter “ya” and the letter “ta” “among you a hundred steadfast, they will overcome two hundred” of them. “And if there are a thousand among you, they will overcome two thousand by permission of God” with His will, and it is news in the sense of a command, meaning that you fight twice as many of you and stand firm against them. “And God is with the steadfast” with His help."
j-0380	And it was revealed when they took ransom from the prisoners of Badr: “It is not for a prophet to have” with the ta’ and the ya’ “captives until he has made a great slaughter in the land” exaggerating in killing the infidels. “You desire” O believers “the goods of this world” its debris by taking ransom “and God desires” for you “the Hereafter” that is, its reward by killing them “and God is Exalted in Might and Wise.” This was abrogated by His saying: “So either a favor from Us afterwards or a ransom.” “Had it not been for a previous decree from God” by making the spoils and prisoners permissible for you “a great punishment would have touched you for what you took” of ransom “so eat of what you have taken as lawful and good, and fear God. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Merciful.” O Prophet, say to those in your hands of the captives” and in the reading of the captives “if God knows good in your hearts” faith and sincerity “He will give you better than what was taken from you” of ransom by doubling it for you in this world and rewarding you in the Hereafter “and forgive you” your sins “and God is Forgiving and Merciful.” “And if they intend to betray you” meaning the captives “they betrayed God before” before Badr by disbelief “and He gave them power” at Badr by killing and taking them captive, so let them expect the same if they return “and God is Knowing” of His creation “and Wise” in His making.
j-0381	“Those who have believed and emigrated and striven hard with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah” - they are the emigrants - “and those who have given shelter” - the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace - “and aided” - they are the Ansar - “they are allies of one another” in aid and inheritance. “And those who have believed and have not emigrated - you have no guardianship over them” - with a kasra or fatha on the waw - “at all” - so there is no inheritance between you and them and no share in the spoils “until they emigrate” - this was abrogated at the end of the surah. “And if they seek aid of you in religion, then you must aid them” against the disbelievers “except against a people between you and whom there is a treaty” - a treaty, so do not aid them against them and break their treaty. “And Allah is Seeing of what you do.” “And those who disbelieve are allies of one another” in aid and inheritance, so there is no inheritance between you and them. “If you do not do so” - that is, take the Muslims as allies and suppress the disbelievers - “there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption” due to the strength of disbelief and the weakness of Islam. “And those who have believed and emigrated and striven hard in the cause of Allah and those who have given shelter And those who supported them, they are the true believers. For them is forgiveness and noble provision” in Paradise. “And those who believed after” that is, after those who were the first to believe and emigrate “and emigrated and fought with you - those are from you” O emigrants and helpers “and those of kinship” those of kinship “are more worthy of one another” in inheritance than inheritance in faith and emigration mentioned in the previous verse “in the Book of God” the Preserved Tablet “Indeed, God is Knowing of all things” and from this is the wisdom of inheritance.
j-0382	"This is “a declaration of innocence from Allah and His Messenger” and its original form is “to those of the polytheists with whom you made a treaty” an absolute treaty or less than four months or more. The text of the treaty is what is mentioned in His statement: “So travel freely” travel in safety, O polytheists “in the land for four months” the first of which is Shawwal as evidenced by what will come and there is no safety for you after that “and know that you will not escape Allah” that is, you will not escape His punishment “and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers” He will humiliate them in this world by killing and in the Hereafter by Hellfire. And a notification from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage, the day of sacrifice, that is, that Allah is innocent of the polytheists and their treaties and His Messenger is also innocent. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, sent Ali from the year, which is the ninth year, so he announced on the day of sacrifice in Mina with these verses and that no polytheist should perform Hajj after this year and no one should circumambulate the House naked. Narrated by Al-Bukhari. So if you repent from disbelief, it is better for you. But if you turn away from faith, then know that you will not escape Allah. And give good tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful, agonizing punishment, which is killing and captivity in this world and Hellfire. In the Hereafter

“Except for those of the polytheists with whom you have made a treaty and who have not failed you in anything” of the conditions of the treaty “nor aided” aided “anyone” of the disbelievers “against you. Then fulfill your treaty with them until” the expiration of “their term” that you made a treaty with. “Indeed, Allah loves the righteous” by fulfilling treaties.

“So when the sacred months have passed,” which is the last period of postponement, “then kill the polytheists wherever you find them” in a state of ihram or sanctity “and take them” as prisoners “and besiege them” in castles and fortresses until they are forced to be killed or to convert to Islam “and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush” a path they take. The word “all” is in the accusative case because the preposition is removed. “But if they repent” from disbelief “and establish prayer and give zakah, then let them go on their way” and do not interfere with them. “Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful” to those who repent.

“And if any of the polytheists” is raised by a verb that explains it, “seeks your protection” seeks your security from being killed “then grant him protection” secure him “so that he may hear the word of Allah.” The Qur’an: “Then escort him to his place of safety,” which is the home of his people if he does not believe, so that his case may be considered. “That,” mentioned, “is because they are a people who do not know,” the religion of God, so they must hear the Qur’an in order to learn."
j-0383	“How can there be a covenant for the polytheists with Allah and with His Messenger?” They are disbelievers in Allah and His Messenger and are treacherous. “Except for those with whom you made a covenant at the Sacred Mosque” on the day of Hudaybiyyah, and they are the Quraysh who were previously exempted. “So if they are upright with you,” they abide by the covenant and do not break it. “So be upright with them” by fulfilling it. “What is the condition?” “Indeed, Allah loves the righteous.” The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was upright with their covenant until they broke it by aiding Banu Bakr against Khuza’ah. “How can there be a covenant for them? And if they gain victory over you, they do not observe with you anything except kinship or covenant. Rather, they harm you as much as they can. The conditional clause is a circumstantial clause. “They please you with their mouths,” with their good words, “but their hearts refuse,” to fulfill it. “And most of them are wicked,” breakers of the covenant. “They have purchased with the verses of Allah,” the Qur’an, “a small price,” of this world, that is, they have abandoned following them for lusts and desires. “So they have turned away from His path,” His religion. “Indeed, they are…” Evil is what they used to do. This is their work. They do not observe towards a believer any pact of kinship or covenant. Those are the transgressors. But if they repent and establish prayer and give zakah, then they are your brothers in religion. And We detail the verses for a people who know.
j-0384	"“And if they break their oaths” violate their covenants “after their agreement and attack your religion” criticize it “then fight the leaders of disbelief” its leaders, in which the apparent is placed in place of the implied “for them are no oaths” covenants “and in one reading it is with the kasra “perhaps they will desist” from disbelief “Will you not” for the purpose of incitement “fight a people who have broken their oaths” their covenants “and intended to expel the Messenger” from Mecca when they consulted about it in Dar al-Nadwa “and they initiated the fighting against you” the first time when they fought Khuza’ah, your allies with Banu Bakr, so what prevents you from fighting them “Do you fear them” do you fear them “but Allah is more deserving that you fear Him” in abandoning fighting them “if you are believers” “Fight them; Allah will punish them” kill them “by your hands and disgrace them” humiliate them by captivity and subjugation “and give you victory over them and heal the breasts of a believing people” by what they did to them, they are Banu Khuza'ah
""And He will remove the anger of their hearts"" their distress ""and God turns in mercy to whom He wills"" by returning to Islam like Abu Sufyan ""and God is Knowing and Wise""
""Or"" with the meaning of the hamza of denial ""did you think that you would be left alone while"" God did not ""know"" the appearance of ""those among you who strive"" sincerely ""and have not taken besides God or His Messenger or the believers as allies"" confidants and allies in meaning and the sincere ones who are described by what was mentioned from others did not appear ""and God is Acquainted with what you do"""
j-0385	“It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosque of Allah while they bear witness against themselves of disbelief. For those, their deeds have become worthless, for they did not stipulate it, and in the Fire they will abide eternally.” “The mosques of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and establish prayer and give zakah and do not fear” anyone “except Allah. It is expected that those will be among the [rightly] guided.”
j-0386	“Have you considered the provision of water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to one who believes in God and the Last Day and strives in the cause of God? They are not equal before God” in virtue “and God does not guide the wrongdoing people” the disbelievers. It was revealed in response to the one who said that, namely al-Abbas or someone else. “Those who have believed and emigrated and striven in the cause of God with their wealth and their lives are greater in degree” in rank “with God” than others “and it is those who are the successful” the victorious with goodness. “Their Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and approval and gardens for them wherein is lasting pleasure” permanent “abiding therein forever” a predicated state “forever.

j-0387	And it was revealed about those who left emigration for the sake of their family and their trade: “O you who have believed, do not take your fathers and your brothers as allies if they prefer” they chose “disbelief over faith. And whoever takes them as allies among you - then those are the wrongdoers.” “Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred” your relatives, or in another reading, your kindred, “and wealth that you have acquired” you have earned, “and commerce whose decline you fear” its not being exhausted, “and dwellings with which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger and striving in His cause” so you sat back for His sake from emigration and striving, “then wait” wait “until Allah brings about His command” as a threat to them, “and Allah does not guide the wicked people.”

It was abrogated by the verse “It is not for the weak.” “And strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of God. That is better for you, if you only knew.” That it is better for you, so do not be sluggish.
j-0396	"And it was revealed about the hypocrites who stayed behind: “If” what you called them to “had been a worldly good” easy to obtain “and a moderate journey” “they would have followed you” seeking the spoils “but the distance became too great for them” so they stayed behind “and they will swear by God” when you return to them “if we could” go out “we would have gone out with you, destroying themselves” with the false oath “and God knows that they are liars” in saying that

The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, had given permission to a group to stay behind due to his own effort, so it was revealed as a reproach to him and he offered forgiveness to reassure his heart “God has pardoned you for giving them permission” to stay behind and why did you not leave them “until it becomes clear to you who are truthful” in the excuse “and you know who are the liars” in it

“Those who believe in God and the Last Day do not ask your permission” to stay behind “to strive with their wealth and their lives. And God is Knowing of the righteous”

j-0400	“Zakat” is given “for the poor” who do not find what is sufficient for them “and the needy” who do not find what is sufficient for them “and those employed to collect it” i.e. the charity, such as the collector, distributor, scribe and gatherer “and those whose hearts are to be reconciled” to convert to Islam or to establish their Islam or to convert their peers or to defend the Muslims. The first and last are not given today according to Al-Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him, due to the glory of Islam, unlike the others, who are given according to the most correct opinion “and for” the release “of slaves” i.e. those who are freed “and for the debtors” those who are in debt if they borrowed for a reason other than sin or repented and they do not have the means to repay or to reconcile differences even if they are rich “and for the cause of God” i.e. those who are engaged in jihad who do not have the spoils even if they are rich “and for the wayfarer” who is stranded on his journey “an obligation” in the accusative case with its implied verb “from God, and God is Knowing” of His creation “and Wise” in His creation, so it is not permissible to spend it on anyone other than these nor to prevent a category of them if they are found, so the imam divides it among them equally and he has the right to prefer some individuals of the category over others Some of the lam indicates that it is obligatory to include all of its individuals, but it is not obligatory on the owner of the money if it is divided due to his difficulty, rather it is sufficient to give three of each type and it is not sufficient to give less than that, as the plural form indicates, and the Sunnah clarifies that the condition of the one given from it is Islam and that he not be a Hashemite or a Mutalibi. “And among them” meaning the hypocrites “are those who harm the Prophet” by criticizing him and transmitting his hadith “and say” if they are forbidden from doing so so that it does not reach him “He is an ear” meaning he hears everything that is said and accepts it, so if we swear to him that we did not tell the truth, “Say” he is “an ear” a listener “is better for you” not an evil listener “who believes in God and believes” he believes “for the believers” in what they told him and not for others, and the lam is extra to differentiate between the faith of submission and other than that “and mercy” in the nominative case in apposition to ear and in the genitive case in apposition to good “for those who believe among you, and those who harm the Messenger of God will have a painful punishment.”
j-0401	«They swear to you by God» O believers, regarding what has reached you about them harming the Messenger, that they did not harm him «to please you, but God and His Messenger have more right that they should please Him» with obedience «if they are believers» truly, and the unification of the pronoun is due to the concomitance of the two satisfactions, or the news of God and His Messenger is omitted. «Do they not know» with «that» that is the matter «whoever opposes» opposes «God and His Messenger, for him is the fire of Hell» as a recompense «to abide therein. That is the great disgrace?» «The hypocrites are wary» fearful «that a surah will be sent down upon them» that is, the believers «informing them of what is in their hearts» of hypocrisy, while they still mock. «Say, mock» a threatening command «for God will bring out» a manifestation «of what you fear» bringing it out of your hypocrisy. «And if» the lam of an oath «you ask them» about their mockery of you and the Qur’an while they were on their way with you to Tabuk «they will surely say» apologetically «we were only conversing and joking» in the conversation to cut off the way, and we did not intend that. “Say” to them, “Was it at Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?” “Make no excuse” for him. “You have disbelieved after your belief.” That is, your disbelief became apparent after showing faith. “If He pardons” with the letter “ya” in the passive voice and the letter “nun” in the active voice “a party among you” with their sincerity and repentance like Jahsh ibn Himyar, “He will punish” with the letter “ta” and the letter “nun” “a party because they were criminals” persisting in hypocrisy and mockery.
j-0402	“The hypocrites, men and women, are of one another” meaning they are similar in religion, like parts of one thing. “They enjoin what is wrong” disbelief and sins “and forbid what is right” faith and obedience “and they withhold their hands” from spending in obedience. “They have forgotten God” they have abandoned His obedience “so He has forgotten them” He abandoned them out of His kindness. “Indeed, the hypocrites are the wicked.” “God has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers the fire of Hell, wherein they will abide eternally. It is sufficient for them” as a reward and punishment. “And God has cursed them” He has distanced them from His mercy “and for them is a lasting punishment”
j-0403	You, O hypocrites, are like those before you who were stronger than you in strength and had more wealth and children. They enjoyed their portion, their share of this world. So you enjoyed your portion, O hypocrites, just as those before you enjoyed their portion. And you plunged, O hypocrites, into falsehood and slander against the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “like those who plunged.” That is, like their plunge. “Those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and it is those who are the losers.” “Did there not come to them the news” of those before them, the people of Noah and Aad, the people of Hud, “and Thamud,” the people of Salih, “and the people of Abraham, and the companions of Madyan,” the people of Shu`ayb, “and the overthrown cities,” the cities of the people of Lot, that is, their people. “Their messengers came to them with clear proofs,” with miracles, but they denied them and were destroyed. “So God would not wrong them,” by punishing them without sin, “but they were wronging themselves,” by committing sin.
j-0404	“The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Those - Allah will have mercy upon them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise.” “Allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally, and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual bliss. And the pleasure of Allah is greater.” That is what is the great attainment.
j-0405	“O Prophet, strive hard against the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and be harsh with them, with rebuke and hatred. Their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.” The reference is to “They swear” that is, the hypocrites “by Allah that they did not say it,” what you have heard about them of cursing. “But they did say the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their Islam,” they showed disbelief after showing Islam. “And they intended that which they did not attain,” of killing the Prophet on the night of al-‘Aqabah when he returned from Tabuk, and they were a dozen men. ‘Ammar ibn Yasir struck the faces of the camels when they deceived him, so they turned back. “And they did not find fault,” they denied, “except that Allah and His Messenger enriched them from His bounty,” with spoils after their great need. The meaning is that they did not obtain from Him anything except this, and it is not something to be found fault with. “But if they repent,” from hypocrisy and believe in you, “it will be better for them, but if they turn away,” from faith, “Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world,” by killing, “and in the Hereafter,” by fire. “And they will have no help on earth.” And there is no protector or helper who can prevent them from it.
j-0406	“And among them are those who made a covenant with Allah, ‘If He should give us from His bounty, we will surely give in charity’” in which the ta’ in the original is assimilated into the sad “and we will surely be among the righteous” he is Tha’laba bin Hatib. He asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to pray for him that Allah would provide him with wealth and that he would give every person his due from it, so he prayed for him and Allah made it easy for him, so he stopped attending Friday prayers and congregational prayers and withheld zakat, as Allah the Almighty said. “But when He gave them from His bounty, they were stingy with it and turned away” from obeying Allah “while they were averse.” “So He made their consequence” that is, He made their consequence “hypocrisy” fixed “in their hearts until the Day they meet Him” that is, Allah, which is the Day of Resurrection “because they failed to fulfill what they promised Allah and because they used to lie” about it. So after that he came to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, with his zakat and said, “Allah has prevented me from accepting it from you.” So he began to throw dirt on his head, then he went to Abu Bakr but he did not accept it, then to ‘Umar but he did not accept it, then to ‘Uthman but he did not accept it, and he died during his time. “Do they not know” that is, the hypocrites “that Allah knows their secrets and their private conversations, and that Allah is the Knower of the unseen. When the verse on charity was revealed, a man came and gave a lot of charity. The hypocrites said, “This is hypocritical.” A man came and gave a sa’ of charity, and they said, “Allah is independent of this charity.” Then the verse was revealed: “Those who” is a subject, “slander” criticize “those who give voluntarily” among the believers in charity, and those who find nothing but their effort” their energy, so they give it “so they ridicule them.” The predicate is “Allah ridiculed them” He will reward them for their ridicule. “And for them is a painful punishment.” Ask forgiveness, O Muhammad, for them or do not ask forgiveness for them. He has a choice in asking forgiveness or leaving it. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, “I was given a choice and I chose asking forgiveness.” Narrated by al-Bukhari: “If you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them.” It was said that what is meant by seventy is exaggeration in the frequency of asking forgiveness. In al-Bukhari, there is a hadith: “If I knew that if I increased to seventy, He would forgive me, I would increase it.” It was also said that what is meant is the specific number for his hadith as well: “And I will increase to Seventy, then He explained to him the decisiveness of forgiveness with a verse: It is the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them. That is because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger. And God does not guide the wicked people.
j-0407	"""Those who stayed behind"" from Tabuk ""rejoiced at their sitting back"" that is, their sitting ""behind"" that is, after ""the Messenger of Allah, and they hated to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah, and they said"" that is, some of them said to each other ""Do not go forth"" go out to jihad ""in the heat. Say, the fire of Hell is more intense"" than Tabuk, so it is better for them to guard against it by not staying behind. ""If they only understood"" knew that, they would not have stayed behind. ""So let them laugh a little"" in this world ""and weep"" in the Hereafter ""much as recompense for what they used to earn"" news about their condition in the imperative form. ""But if Allah returns you"" from Tabuk ""to a party of them"" of the hypocrites who stayed behind in Medina ""and they ask your permission to go out"" with you to another expedition ""say"" to them ""You will never go out with me, nor will you fight with me an enemy. You were satisfied to sit back the first time, so sit with those who stayed behind"" those who stayed behind from the expedition, including women, children, and others. When the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, prayed over Ibn Abi Talib, he descended “And never pray over any of them who dies, nor stand at his grave” for burial or visitation. “For they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were wicked.” “And let not their wealth and their children impress you. Allah only intends to punish them thereby in this world and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers.”"
j-0408	“And when a surah is revealed” meaning a section of the Qur’an “that” meaning that “they should believe in God and strive with His Messenger, those of wealth among them ask your permission and say, “Leave us to be with those who stay behind” “They are content to be with those who stay behind” the plural of khalifa meaning the women who stay behind in the houses “and their hearts are sealed so they do not understand” the good
j-0409	“But the Messenger and those who believed with him strove with their wealth and their lives. And it is those who will have good things” in this world and the Hereafter. “And it is those who are the successful.” That is, the victorious. “God has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the great attainment.”
j-0410	"""And those who have excuses have come"" by assimilating the ta' in the original to the dal, meaning those who have excuses, and it was read with this meaning ""from the bedouins"" to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, ""that permission may be given to them"" to sit down for their excuse, so he gave them permission. ""And those who denied God and His Messenger sat down"" in claiming faith from the hypocrites of the bedouins about coming to apologize. ""A painful punishment will befall those who disbelieve among them."" ""There is no blame upon the weak"" such as the elderly ""nor upon the sick"" such as the blind or the chronically ill ""nor upon those who do not find anything to spend"" in jihad ""if they are sincere to God and His Messenger"" in their sitting down without spreading rumors, discouraging, and obeying. ""There is no way upon the doers of good"" in that ""of punishment"" a way of being held accountable. ""And God is Forgiving"" of them, ""Merciful"" to them in the expansion in that. ""And there is no blame upon those who, when they came to you that you might carry them"" with you to the conquest, and they were seven of the Ansar, and it was said that they were Banu Muqarrin. ""You said, 'I do not find anything to carry you on'"" the state of ""they turned away"" the answer to if. That is, they turned away, “and their eyes were overflowing” flowing “with” for clarification “tears of grief” because “they cannot find anything to spend” in jihad. “The path is only against those who ask your permission” to stay behind “while they are rich and are content to be with those who stayed behind, and Allah has sealed their hearts so they do not know.” A similar example has come before. “They will apologize to you” for staying behind “when you return to them” from the conquest. “Say” to them, “Do not apologize. We will not believe you.” “Allah has already informed us of your news.” That is, He has informed us of your conditions. “And Allah will see your deeds and His Messenger. Then you will be returned” by resurrection “to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed,” that is, Allah. “Then He will inform you of what you used to do,” so He will reward you for it. “They will swear to you by Allah when you return” you return “to them” from Tabuk that they are excused for staying behind “so turn away from them. Indeed, they are unclean” filthy because of the evil of their inner selves. “And their refuge is Hell.” “As a reward for what they used to earn.” “They swear to you so that you may be pleased with them. But if you are pleased with them, then indeed, Allah is not pleased with the wicked people.” That is, with them."
j-0411	"“The bedouins” the Bedouins “are more severe in disbelief and hypocrisy” than the people of the cities because of their harshness and coarse nature and their distance from listening to the Qur’an “and more deserving” that is, “not to know the limits of what Allah has sent down to His Messenger” of rulings and laws “and Allah is Knowing” of His creation “and Wise” in what He does with them

“And among the bedouins are some who consider what they spend” in the way of Allah “as a loss” as a loss and a loss because he does not hope for its reward but rather spends it out of fear, and they are Banu Asad and Ghatafan “and waits” awaits “for you the circles” the circles of time that they will turn against you so that “upon them will be the circle of evil” with the dammah and the fathah, meaning that the torment and destruction will revolve around them, not you “and Allah is Hearing” of the words of His servants “and Knowing” of their actions

“And among the bedouins are some who believe in Allah and the Last Day” like Juhaynah and Muzaynah “and consider what they spend” in the way of Allah “as acts of devotion” that bring him closer “to Allah” and a means to “prayers” the supplications of “the Messenger” for him “unquestionably” that is, Their spending is “a sacrifice” with the letter “ra” pronounced with a damma or a sukoon “for them” with Him. “Allah will admit them into His mercy” His Paradise. “Allah is Forgiving” to those who obey Him, “Merciful” to them."
j-0412	“And the first forerunners among the Muhajireen and the Ansar” - those who witnessed Badr or all of the Companions - “and those who followed them” until the Day of Resurrection “with good conduct” in deeds “God is pleased with them” with His obedience “and they are pleased with Him” with His reward “and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow” - and in another reading there is an addition of “therein to abide forever. That is the great attainment.”
j-0413	"“And among those around you,” O people of Medina, “are hypocrites,” such as Aslam, Ashja’ and Ghaffar. “And among the people of Medina,” also hypocrites, “are stubborn in hypocrisy,” persisting in it and continuing. “You do not know them; We know them. We will punish them twice,” with disgrace or killing in this world and the torment of the grave. “Then they will be returned,” in the Hereafter, “to a great punishment,” which is the Fire. “And” “another people,” is the subject, “who have acknowledged their sins,” from the description of staying behind, and the predicate, “they have mixed a righteous deed,” which is their jihad before that or their admission of their sins or something else, “and another evil,” which is their staying behind. “Perhaps God will accept their repentance. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Merciful.” It was revealed about Abu Lubabah and a group who tied themselves up to the pillars of the mosque when they heard what was revealed about those who stayed behind, and they swore that none would release them except the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, so he released them when it was revealed. “Take from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and sanctify them,” from their sins, so he took a third of their wealth and gave it in charity. “And pray over them,” that is, pray. To them, ""Indeed, your prayer is a reassurance"" mercy ""for them"" and it was said, reassurance by accepting their repentance ""and Allah is Hearing and Knowing""

""Do they not know that Allah is the Accepter of repentance from His servants and takes"" accepts ""the charities and that Allah is the Accepter of repentance"" to His servants by accepting their repentance ""the Most Merciful"" to them. The question is for confirmation and the purpose of it is to incite them to repentance and charity

""And say"" to them or to the people ""Do"" whatever you wish ""and Allah will see your work and His Messenger and the believers and you will be returned"" by resurrection ""to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed"" that is, Allah ""and He will inform you of what you used to do"" and He will reward you for it

""And others"" of those who stayed behind ""are deferred"" with the hamza or without it, delayed from repentance ""for the command of Allah"" in them as He wills ""either He will punish them"" by killing them without repentance ""or He will forgive them and Allah is Knowing"" of His creation ""Wise"" in what He does with them and they are the three who came after Murarah ibn al-Rabi' and Ka'b ibn Malik and Hilal ibn Umayya stayed behind Laziness and inclination towards ease, not hypocrisy, and they did not apologize to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, like others, so their matter was halted for fifty nights and the people abandoned them until their repentance was revealed after that."
j-0414	“And” among them “are those who took a mosque” and they were twelve hypocrites “to cause harm” to the people of the Quba’ Mosque “and disbelief” because they built it on the orders of Abu Amir the monk to be a stronghold for him to bring in whoever came from him, and he had gone to bring soldiers from Caesar to fight the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace “and to cause division among the believers” who prayed in Quba’ because some of them prayed in their mosque “and as an ambush” in anticipation “for those who fought against God and His Messenger before” that is, before it was built, and he is the aforementioned Abu Amir “and they will swear that” we “intended” by building it “nothing but” the good “deed” of being kind to the poor in the rain and heat and being generous to the Muslims “and God bears witness that they are liars” in that, and they had asked the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, to pray in it, so it was revealed: “Do not pray in it ever again.” So he sent a group who demolished it and burned it and made in its place a garbage dump where corpses are thrown for a mosque whose foundations were built on piety from the first day it was laid, the day I arrived in the House of Migration, and it is the Quba’ Mosque as in Bukhari, more deserving From it, that is, that you stand up and pray in it, in it are men who are the Ansar who love to purify themselves, and Allah loves those who purify themselves, that is, He rewards them. In it, the assimilation of the ta’ in the original into the ta’. Ibn Khuzaymah narrated in his Sahih on the authority of Uwaimir ibn Sa’idah that he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, came to them in the Quba’ Mosque and said, “Allah has praised you well for purification in the story of your mosque. What is this purification with which you purify yourself?” They said, “By Allah, O Messenger of Allah, we do not know anything except that we had Jewish neighbors who used to wash their backsides after defecating, so we washed as they washed.” In a hadith narrated by al-Bazzar, they said, “We wash the stones with water.” He said, “That is it, so you must do it.” “Is he who founded his building on piety” fear “of Allah” hope “and approval” from Him “better, or he who founded his building on the brink” edge of “a precipice” with a damma or sukoon on the ra’, a “collapsing” side “on the verge of collapse” “so it collapsed with him” fell with its builder “into the fire of Hell” the best example of building on the opposite of piety with what it leads to, and the question is for confirmation, meaning the first is better and it is an example of the Quba’ Mosque and the second is an example of the Mosque of Harm “And God does not guide the wrongdoing people.” “Their structure which they have built will continue to be a source of doubt in their hearts unless their hearts are severed” by their death. “And God is Knowing” of His creation, “Wise” in what He does with them.
j-0415	“Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties” by spending them in His obedience, such as jihad “in exchange for Paradise for them. They fight in the cause of Allah, killing and being killed” is a resumptive clause explaining the purchase. In a reading with the passive voice, meaning some of them are killed and the rest are fought, “a true promise binding upon Him” two sources in the accusative case with their deleted verb “in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’an. And who is more faithful to his covenant than Allah?” meaning no one is more faithful than He. “So rejoice” in it, a shift from the third person “in your transaction which you have made. And that” the transaction “is the great attainment” that which is attained, the ultimate goal sought. “Those who repent” is raised in praise by estimating the subject of polytheism and hypocrisy, “those who worship” those who are sincere in worshipping Allah, “those who praise” Him in every situation, “those who travel” those who fast, “those who bow and prostrate” that is, those who pray, “those who enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and those who observe the limits of Allah” of His rulings by acting upon them, “and give good tidings to the believers” of Paradise.
j-0416	And it was revealed in his seeking forgiveness, may God bless him and grant him peace, for his uncle Abu Talib and the seeking forgiveness of some of the Companions for his polytheist parents: It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to seek forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire, because they died in disbelief. And Abraham’s seeking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him, saying, “I will seek forgiveness for you from my Lord,” hoping that he would become Muslim. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God, because he died in disbelief, he disavowed him and stopped seeking forgiveness for him. Indeed, Abraham was a man of compassion, much in supplication and prayer, forbearing and patient with harm. “And God would not lead a people astray after He has guided them” to Islam “until He makes clear to them what they should avoid” of action, so they do not avoid it and thus deserve to be led astray. “Indeed, God is Knowing of all things” and from Him He deserves to be led astray and guided. “Indeed, to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. And you have not” O people “besides God” that is, other than Him “any protector” to protect you from Him “or helper” to prevent you from His harm.
j-0417	"“Allah has indeed accepted the repentance of the Prophet, the Muhajireen, and the Ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship,” that is, at that time, which was their situation in the Battle of Tabuk. Two men would share a date, and ten would follow one camel, and the heat was so intense that they drank the dung, “after the hearts of a party of them had almost swerved,” with the ta’ and the ya’, “then He accepted their repentance,” by remaining steadfast, “for He is to them Kind and Merciful.” “And He accepted the repentance of the three who were left behind,” by refusing to accept their repentance, according to a context, “until the earth, with all its vastness, became too narrow for them,” that is, with its vastness, so they could not find a place to feel secure in, “and their souls became too narrow for them,” their hearts because of the grief and loneliness caused by the delay of their repentance, so that there could be no joy or comfort in them, “and they thought,” lightened, “that there is no refuge from Allah except to Him. Then He accepted their repentance,” and guided them to repent, “that they might repent. Indeed, Allah is the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful.” “O you who have believed.” Fear God” by abandoning His disobedience “and be with the truthful” in faith and covenants by adhering to truthfulness
“It is not for the people of Medina and the bedouins around them to stay behind the Messenger of God” when he goes on a campaign “nor to prefer their lives over his” by protecting them from the hardships he has accepted for himself, and this is a prohibition in the form of a report “that” meaning the prohibition against staying behind “because” because they “suffer neither thirst nor fatigue nor hunger in the cause of God nor do they tread a path” a source meaning tread “that enrages” angers “the disbelievers nor do they attain from an enemy” of God “anything” killing or capturing or looting “except that a good deed is recorded for them for it” so that they are rewarded for it “for God does not allow to be lost the reward of the righteous” meaning their reward, rather He rewards them
“nor do they spend” in it “a small expenditure” even a date “nor a large one nor do they cross a valley” by traveling “except that a good deed is recorded for them for it” so that He may reward them for it “for God does not allow the reward of the righteous to be lost” meaning their reward, rather He rewards them
“nor do they spend” in it “a small expenditure” even a date “nor a large one nor do they cross a valley” by traveling “except that a good deed is recorded for them for it “so that He may reward them” God rewarded them for what they did."
j-0418	When they were rebuked for staying behind and the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, sent out a raiding party, they all went out, so the following verse was revealed: “It is not for the believers to go out” to the conquest “all at once. Why not” why “a party from every division” tribe “should go out” a group and the rest should stay “that they may gain understanding” that is, those who stayed “in religion and warn their people when they return to them” from the conquest by teaching them what they had learned of the rulings “that they may beware” of God’s punishment by obeying His commands and prohibitions. Ibn Abbas said that this is specific to the raiding parties, and the one before it forbade staying behind one person if the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, went out. “O you who have believed, fight those of the disbelievers who are near you” that is, the closest to them, “and let them find in you harshness” severity, that is, be harsh with them “and know that God is with the righteous” with aid and victory.
j-0419	"“And when a surah is revealed” of the Qur’an “some of them” that is, the hypocrites “say” to their companions in mockery “Which of you has this increased in faith” in belief? God Almighty said “But as for those who believe, it increases them in faith” because of their belief in it “and they rejoice” they are happy with it. “And as for those in whose hearts is disease” weak belief “it increases them in uncleanliness upon their uncleanliness” disbelief upon their disbelief because of their disbelief in it “and they die while they are disbelievers.” “Do they not see” with the letter “ya” that is, the hypocrites and the letter “ta” O believers “that they are tested” that they are afflicted “once or twice every year” with famine and diseases “and then they do not repent” from their hypocrisy “nor do they remember” they are admonished? “And when a surah is revealed” in which they are mentioned and the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, recites it “they look at one another” wanting to flee, they say “Does anyone see you” if you stand up, then if no one sees them stand up, otherwise they remain “then they turn away” in their disbelief “Allah has turned their hearts away” from guidance ""Because they are a people who do not understand"" the truth due to their lack of contemplation."
j-0420	“There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves,” that is, from among you, Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. “Mighty is he for whom you are suffering,” that is, your suffering, that is, your hardship and your encounter with harm. “He is anxious over you,” that you be guided. “To the believers, kind,” intensely merciful. “Merciful,” he wants good for them. “But if they turn away,” from believing in you, “then say, ‘Sufficient for me is God; there is no god but He. In Him I have relied, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne,’” He singled it out for mention because it is the greatest of all creation. Al-Hakim narrated in Al-Mustadrak on the authority of Ubayy ibn Ka’b that the last verse to be revealed was “There has certainly come to you a Messenger,” to the end of the surah.
j-0421	«Alif, Lam, Ra» God knows best what He meant by that «Those» that is, these verses «The verses of the Book» the Qur’an and the addition has the meaning of «of» the «Wise» the decisive «Was it ever a wonder to mankind» that is, the people of Mecca, a question of denial and the preposition and the noun in the genitive case in the state of His saying «that We revealed» that is, Our revelation «to a man from among them» Muhammad «that» is an explanatory «warn» the fear «of mankind» the disbelievers of the punishment «and give good tidings to those who believe that» that «they will have a precedent» a past «truth with their Lord» that is, a good reward for the deeds they have done «the disbelievers say, «This» the Qur’an which includes that «is clear magic» clear and in one reading, to a magician and the one referred to is the Prophet
j-0422	“Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days” of the worldly days, that is, in their amount, because there was no sun or moon there, and if He had willed, He would have created them in a flash, and turning away from that would have taught His creation to verify. “Then He established Himself on the Throne” an establishment befitting Him. “He directs the affair” among the creatures. “There is no” relative clause “intercessor” who intercedes for anyone “except after His permission” a response to their saying that idols intercede for them. “That” the Creator and Administrator “is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him” and make Him alone. “Will you not then remember?” by assimilating the ta’ in the original into the dhal. “To Him” the Most High “is your return. The promise of Allah is truth” two verbal nouns in the accusative case with their implied verb. “Indeed” with the kasra as a resumption and the fatha with the estimation of the lam “He begins creation” that is, He began it with creation. “Then He will repeat it” with resurrection. “That He may reward” reward “those who believe and do righteous deeds with justice. But those who disbelieve will have a drink of scalding water” water that has reached the utmost heat “and a painful punishment” painful “for what they used to disbelieve” that is, because of their disbelief. “It is He who made the sun, the earth, and the heavens and the earth” “Diya’” meaning light “and the moon is a light and its measure” in terms of its movement “is mansions” twenty-eight mansions in twenty-eight nights of each month and it is hidden for two nights if the month is thirty days or one night if it is twenty-nine days “that you may know” thereby “the number of years and the reckoning. Allah did not create that” mentioned “except in truth” not in vain, exalted be He above that. “He details” with the ya’ and the nun, clarifying “the signs for a people who know” who ponder. “Indeed, in the alternation of the night and the day” in going and coming, increase and decrease “and in what Allah has created in the heavens” of angels, sun, moon, stars and other things “and” on “the earth” of animals, mountains, seas, rivers, trees and other things “are signs” indicating His Almighty power “for a people who fear Allah” so they believe. He singled them out for mention because they are the ones who benefit from it.
j-0423	"“Those who do not expect to meet Us” with the Resurrection “and are satisfied with the life of this world” instead of the Hereafter because they deny it “and are content with it” are content with it “and those who are heedless of Our signs” the proofs of Our Oneness “and neglect to contemplate them” “Their abode is the Fire because of what they used to earn” of polytheism and sins
“Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds - their Lord will guide them” will direct them “through their faith” in Him by making for them a light by which they will be guided on the Day of Resurrection “Beneath them rivers will flow in Gardens of Delight” “Their call therein” their request they desire in Paradise is to say “Glory be to You, O God” meaning O God, so when they seek it they will find it before them “and their greeting therein” among themselves “is, ‘Peace’ and their final call therein is” an explanatory “Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds” and it was revealed when the polytheists hastened the punishment"
j-0424	“And if Allah were to hasten for people evil as they hasten” that is, as they hasten “for good, their term would have been decreed” in the passive and active constructions “for them” in the nominative and accusative, so that He would destroy them, but He would give them respite. “Then We leave” We leave “those who do not expect to meet Us, in their transgression they wander blindly” they hesitate and are perplexed. “And when harm” sickness and poverty touches man, the disbeliever, “he calls upon Us lying on his side” that is, lying down “or sitting or standing” that is, in any case “but when We remove his harm from him, he passes on” despite his disbelief “as if” lightened and its subject is omitted, that is, as if “he had not called upon Us for harm that had touched him. Thus” just as supplication in times of harm and turning away in times of prosperity were made attractive to the transgressors, the polytheists, “what they used to do was made attractive to the transgressors.” “And We had certainly destroyed generations” nations “before you” O people of Mecca “when they were unjust” by polytheism “and” their messengers had come to them with clear proofs” indicating their truthfulness “but they would not believe.” In apposition to the wronged, “Thus” as We destroyed those, “We recompense the criminal people,” the disbelievers. “Then We made you,” O people of Mecca, “successors,” the plural of successor, “in the land after them, that We may see how you will act,” in it and whether you will take heed from them and believe in Our messengers.
j-0425	"“And when Our verses are recited to them, the Qur’an, as clear proofs, apparent in their state, those who do not expect to meet Us, say, ‘Bring a Qur’an other than this,’ in which there is no fault of our gods, ‘or change it,’ of your own accord. Say, to them, ‘It is not right for me to change it of my own accord. I follow only what is revealed to me. Indeed, I fear, if I disobey my Lord,’ by changing it, ‘the punishment of a tremendous Day,’ which is the Day of Resurrection. Say, ‘If God had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would I have informed you of it. ’ ‘La’ is a negative particle in apposition to what precedes it. In another reading, ‘lam’ is the answer to ‘law’, meaning that I would have informed you of it through the tongue of someone other than myself. I have dwelt among you a lifetime, forty years, before this, not telling you anything. Do you not then understand? ’ That it is not from me? ’ ‘So who,’ that is, no one, ‘is more unjust than he who invents a lie against God,’ by attributing a partner to Him, ‘or denies His verses,’ the Qur’an. ‘It is not ""The criminals"" the polytheists are happy"
j-0426	“And they worship besides God” that is, other than Him “that which neither harms them” if they do not worship it “nor benefits them” if they worship it, and that is, idols “and they say” about it “These are our intercessors with God.” Say to them “Do you inform God” His might “of that which He does not know in the heavens and the earth” a question of denial, since if He had a partner He would have known it, since nothing is hidden from Him. “Glory be to Him” purifying Him “and exalted be He above what they associate” with Him. “And mankind were but one community” following one religion, which is Islam, from Adam to Noah, and it was said from the time of Abraham to Amr ibn Luhay “and they differed” because some remained steadfast and some disbelieved “and had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord” delaying the recompense until the Day of Resurrection “it would have been judged between them” that is, the people in this world “concerning that over which they differ” of religion by punishing the disbelievers. “And they say” that is, the people of Mecca “Why was not” “revealed to him” to Muhammad “a sign from his Lord” as was the case for the prophets, such as the she-camel, the staff, and the hand “So say” For them, “The unseen” is what is hidden from the servants, that is, His command, “is only for God,” including the signs, and none can bring them except Him, and it is only for me to convey, “so await” the punishment if you do not believe, “I am with you among those who await.”
j-0427	“And when We let the people taste mercy” meaning the infidels of Mecca “after hardship” misery and drought “has afflicted them, then they have a plan against Our verses” by mocking and denying them. “Say” to them, “Allah is swifter in plan” as a recompense. “Indeed, Our messengers” the guardians “write down what you plan” with the ta’ and the ya’. “It is He who guides you” in another reading, “He spreads you” “on land and sea until, when you are in the ships” the vessels “and they sail with them with a wind” “and sail” in it is a shift from the address with a pleasant wind” gentle “and they rejoice in it, a violent wind comes upon it” a strong wind that breaks everything “and the waves come upon them from every side and they think that they are surrounded” meaning destroyed. “They supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion” the supplication. “If” the lam of an oath “you should save us from this” the terrors “we will surely be among the grateful” the monotheists. “But when He saves them, at once they rebel upon the earth without right” with polytheism. “O mankind, your rebellion is only” Your injustice “upon yourselves” because its sin upon them is “the enjoyment of the life of this world” you enjoy it for a little while “then to Us is your return” after death “and We will inform you of what you used to do” so We will agree with you about it. And in a reading with the accusative case, enjoyment means you enjoy
j-0428	“The example” of “the life of this world is like water” rain “which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mixes with it” because of it, and some of it is intertwined with others “of that which people eat” of wheat, barley, and other things “and the livestock” of pasture “until, when the earth takes on its adornment” its beauty from vegetation “and is beautified” with flowers, the root of which is tasannat, the ta’ was replaced with a zay and was assimilated into the zay “and its people think that they have power over it” able to obtain its fruits “Our command comes to it” our decree or punishment “by night or by day, and We make it” that is, its crops “a harvest” like that harvested with sickles “as if” lightened, that is, as if it “had not availed” it “yesterday.” Thus do We detail” we explain “the signs for a people who give thought.” “And God invites to the abode of peace” that is, safety, which is Paradise, by calling to faith “and guides whom He wills” His guidance “to a straight path” the religion of Islam.
j-0429	“For those who do good” by faith “is the best” Paradise “and more” is looking at Him, the Most High, as in the hadith of Muslim. “And their faces will not be covered” darkness “nor humiliation” gloom. “Those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.” “And those” in apposition to those who do good, meaning, for those “who have earned evil deeds” committed polytheism “the recompense of an evil deed is like it, and humiliation will overwhelm them. They will have from Allah no” redundant “protector” to prevent “as if their faces had been covered” with pieces” with the opening of the ta’, the plural of piece and with a sukoon on it, “part” “of the night in darkness. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.”
j-0430	“And” remember “the Day We shall gather them” that is, creation “all together, then We shall say to those who associated others with Allah, “You and your partners” that is, the idols, “and We shall remove” We shall distinguish “between them” and the believers as in the verse, “And separate yourselves today, O criminals.” “And their partners will say” to them, “You did not worship Us” that is, “Ma” negative, and the object was brought forward for the sake of separating. “Then sufficient is Allah as a witness between us and you. Indeed” lightened, that is, indeed “we were unaware of your worship.” “There” that is, that Day “you will be tested” by the trial, and in a reading with two ta’s of recitation “every soul will be tested for what it put forth” brought forward from the action “and they will be returned to Allah, their true Master” the fixed and everlasting “and what they used to invent” about Him of partners will be lost” hidden from them.
j-0431	«Say» to them «Who provides for you from the sky» with rain «and the earth» with plants «Or who has control over hearing» meaning hearing, that is, He created it «and sight?

So say» to them «Will you not then fear God» so you will believe? «That» the doer of these things «is God, your Lord, the Truth» the established «So what is after the Truth except error» a question of confirmation, that is, there is nothing after it except it, so whoever errs in the Truth, which is the worship of God, falls into error «So how» how «are you turned away» from faith when the proof has been established? «Thus» just as these were turned away from faith «the word of your Lord has come into effect upon those who are wicked» they disbelieved, and it is «I will surely fill Hell» the verse or it is «that they will not believe»
j-0432	"""Say: Is there among your associates one who initiates creation and then repeats it?"" Say: ""Allah initiates creation and then repeats it. So how are you turned away?""

""Say: Allah guides to the truth. Is he who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed than he who does not guide unless he is guided?"" Is he more worthy to be followed? This is a question of confirmation and rebuke, meaning the first is more worthy. ""Then what is the matter with you? How do you judge?"" This corrupt judgment of following what it is not right to follow. ""And most of them follow nothing"" in worshipping idols ""except conjecture"" in which they imitated their fathers.

j-0434	"“And on the Day He will gather them together it will be as if they had not remained in this world or in the graves except for an hour of a day” because of the horror of what they saw. The simile is a state of the pronoun. “They will recognize one another” they will recognize one another when they are resurrected, then recognition will cease because of the intensity of the horrors. The simile is a state of the subject or is related to the circumstance. “Those who denied the meeting with Allah have certainly lost” because of the resurrection. “And they were not guided.” “And either” in it is the assimilation of the conditional “nun” of “in” into the additional “ma” “We will show you some of what We promise them” with it of torment in your lifetime. The answer to the condition is omitted, that is, “or We will take you” before their torment. “Then to Us is their return. Then Allah is Witness” of what they do, of their denial and disbelief, so He will torment them with the most severe torment. “And for every nation” of the nations “there is a messenger. So when their messenger comes” to them and they deny him, “it will be judged between them with justice” with fairness, so they will be tormented and the messenger and those who believe him will be saved. “And they will not be wronged” by tormenting them without a crime. So that is how we do. With these

“Say, ‘Have you considered’” tell me “if His punishment comes to you” meaning Allah “at night” by night “or by day, what” meaning anything “will the criminals” the polytheists “haste it” meaning the punishment? In it, the apparent is placed in place of the implied and the interrogative sentence is the answer to the condition like your saying, “If I come to you, what will you give me?” What is meant by it is intimidation, meaning how great is what they hastened

“Then, when it comes” comes to you “will you believe in it” meaning Allah or the punishment when it descends? The hamza is for denying the delay, so it will not be accepted from you, and it is said to you “now” you believe “while you were in it” ""You are hastening"" mockingly

""Then it will be said to those who did wrong, ""Taste the punishment of eternity"" meaning that in which you will remain eternal. ""Are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn?""

""And they ask you"" they inquire of you ""Is it true?"" meaning what you promised us of punishment and resurrection. ""Say, 'Yes, by my Lord, it is the truth, and you will not escape'"" by averting the punishment."
j-0435	“And if every soul that has wronged had all that is on the earth” all of the wealth “it would ransom itself with it” from the punishment on the Day of Resurrection “and they concealed their regret” for abandoning faith “when they saw the punishment” their leaders concealed it from the weak whom they led astray for fear of reproach “and it would be judged between them” between the creatures “with justice” with fairness “and they will not be wronged” at all. “Unquestionably, to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Unquestionably, the promise of God” of resurrection and recompense “is true” established “but most of them” that is, the people “do not know” that. “It is He who gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned” in the Hereafter, so He will reward you for your deeds.”
j-0436	“O mankind,” that is, the people of Mecca, “there has come to you instruction from your Lord,” a book containing what is for you and what is against you, which is the Qur’an, “and a cure,” a medicine, “for what is in the breasts,” of corrupt beliefs and doubts, “and guidance,” from misguidance, “and a mercy for the believers,” in it. “Say, ‘In the bounty of Allah,’ Islam, “and in His mercy,’ the Qur’an, “so in that,” bounty and mercy, “let them rejoice. It is better than what they accumulate,” of the world, with the letter ya and ta. “Say, ‘Have you considered,’ tell me, “what Allah has sent down for you of provision, of which you have made lawful and unlawful,” such as the bahīrah, the sā’ibah, and the dead animal? “Say, ‘Has Allah permitted you,’ in that to make lawful and unlawful?’ “Or,’ rather, ‘you invent a lie against Allah,’ you lie by attributing that to Him?’” “And what do those who invent a lie against Allah think of Him on the Day of Resurrection?” Do they think that He will not punish them? “Indeed, Allah is full of bounty to the people,” by granting them respite and bestowing favors upon them, “but most of them are not grateful.”
j-0437	“And you are not engaged in any affair, O Muhammad, nor do you recite from it any Qur’an, that is, from the affair or from God, nor do you do any deed but that We are witnesses over you when you proceed therein. And not even the weight of an atom, the smallest ant, is hidden from your Lord on earth or in heaven, nor is it smaller than that or larger, but that it is in a clear Book.”
j-0438	“Behold, the friends of Allah have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve” in the Hereafter. They are “those who believed and were fearing” Allah by obeying His commands and prohibitions. “For them is good tidings in the life of this world.” This was interpreted in a hadith authenticated by al-Hakim as a righteous vision that a man sees or that is seen for him. “And in the Hereafter,” Paradise and reward. “There is no change in the words of Allah,” no breaking of His promises. “That,” mentioned, “is the great attainment.”
j-0439	«And let not their statement grieve you» to you that you are not a messenger and others «for indeed» the resumption «of glory» the power «to Allah all is He, He is the Hearing» of the statement «the Knowing» of the action, so He will reward them and grant you victory «Behold, to Allah belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth» servants, kings and creation «and those they invoke» worship «other than Allah» that is, other than Him, idols «do not follow» in that «except assumption» that is, their assumption that they are gods who intercede for them «and indeed» that «they are only guessing» they lie in that «He it is Who has made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day to see» the attribution of sight to Him is a metaphor because He sees in it «there are certainly signs in that» indications of His oneness, exalted be He «for a people who listen» the hearing of contemplation and admonition «they said» that is, the Jews and Christians and whoever claims that the angels are daughters of Allah «has Allah taken a son» the Most High said to them «glory be to Him» absolving Him from having a son «He is The Rich One, who is independent of everyone, and only the one who needs a child seeks him. “To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth,” in terms of ownership, creation, and servants. “If” what “you have of authority” is an argument “for this,” what you say, “Do you say about God that which you do not know?” A question of rebuke. “Say, ‘Indeed, those who invent falsehood against God’ by attributing a child to Him, “will not succeed,” will not be happy. They will have “a little enjoyment” in this world, which they will enjoy for the duration of their lives. “Then to Us is their return,” in death. “Then We will make them taste the severe punishment,” after death, “because they used to disbelieve.”
j-0440	“And recite to them,” O Muhammad, “the news,” the news of “Noah,” and it is substituted for it, “when he said to his people, ‘O my people, if my stay among you is too much for you, and my reminding you of the signs of God, then upon God I have relied. So decide your plan, resolve on a matter that you will do to me, and your partners, the waw has the meaning of with, “then let not your plan be a source of worry for you,” hidden, but rather show it and make it public to me, “then carry it out to me,” proceed with what you want, “and do not wait,” give me respite, for I do not care about you. “But if you turn away,” from reminding me, “then I have not asked you for any reward,” a reward for it, so turn away. “My reward,” my reward, “is only upon God, and I have been commanded to be among the Muslims.” “But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ark,” the ship, “and We made them,” that is, those with him, “successors,” on the earth, “and We drowned those who denied Our signs,” with the flood, “so look.” How was the end of those who were warned? That is how We will deal with those who deny.
j-0441	"“Then We sent after him” meaning Noah “messengers to their people” such as Abraham, Hud and Salih “and they came to them with clear proofs” miracles “but they were not to believe in what they had denied before” meaning sending messengers to them “thus do We seal” We seal “the hearts of the transgressors” so that they do not accept belief as We sealed the hearts of those

“Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his chiefs” his people “with Our signs” the nine “but they were arrogant” about believing in them “and they were a criminal people”

“But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, ‘Indeed, this is obvious magic’” clear and apparent

“Moses said, ‘Do you say of the truth when it has come to you, that it is magic, “Is this magic?” And the one who brought it succeeded and nullified the magic of the magicians “but magicians will not succeed” and the question in both places is for denial

“They said, ‘Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers doing and that you both may have grandeur’ the kingdom “on the earth” The land of Egypt ""and we are not believers in you"""
j-0442	"""And Pharaoh said, 'Bring me every learned magician'"" excelling in the knowledge of magic.

So when the magicians came, Moses said to them after they had said to him, 'Either you throw or we will throw. Throw what you are throwing.'

""So when they threw"" their ropes and staffs, ""Moses said, 'What'"" interrogative, subject, predicate, ""you have brought? Magic"" substitute, and in a reading with one hamza, informative, so what is a relative pronoun, subject, ""Indeed, Allah will nullify it"" that is, He will destroy it. ""Indeed, Allah does not amend the work of corrupters.""

""And Allah will establish"" confirm and show ""the truth with His words"" with His promises ""even though the criminals dislike it.""

""None believed in Moses except a group"" of"" the children of ""his people"" that is, Pharaoh ""for fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest he tempt them"" divert them from his religion by torturing them. ""And indeed, Pharaoh was haughty"" arrogant ""in the land"" the land of Egypt ""and indeed, he is among the transgressors"" those who exceeded the limit by claiming divinity.

""And Moses said, 'O my people, if you have believed in Allah “So put your trust in Him, if you are Muslims.” “They said, ‘In God we have put our trust. Our Lord, do not make us a trial for the wrongdoing people.’” That is, do not make them prevail over us so that they think they are on the right path and are tempted by us. “And save us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.”"
j-0443	And We inspired Moses and his brother, saying, “Settle for your people in Egypt in houses and make your houses places of prayer.” A place of prayer in which you pray so that you may be safe from fear. Pharaoh had prevented them from praying. “And establish prayer.” Complete it. “And give good tidings to the believers.” “Our Lord,” You gave them that, “that they may go astray” “from Your way,” Your religion. “Our Lord, obliterate their wealth” transform it “and harden their hearts” seal them and secure them “so they will not believe until they see the painful punishment.” The painful punishment. He prayed against them and Aaron responded to his prayer. “He,” the Most High, “said, ‘Your prayer has been answered.’” So their wealth was transformed into stones, and Pharaoh did not believe until he was drowned. “So stand firm” in the message and the call until the punishment came to them “and do not follow the way of those who do not know.” In a judicial haste, it was narrated that he remained after that for forty years.
j-0444	“And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his hosts pursued them in oppression and enmity” is an object for which “until, when drowning overtook him, he said, ‘I believe that there is no god in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.’” He repeated it so that it would be accepted from him, but it was not accepted. Gabriel put some of the sea mud into his mouth for fear that mercy would reach him and said to him, “Now” you believe, “while you disobeyed before and were of the corrupters,” and led you astray from the faith. “So today We will save you” We will bring you out of the sea “with your body” your soulless body “that you may be a sign to those who come after you” after you “a lesson” so that they may know your servitude and not commit the same act as you. And from Ibn Abbas that some of the Children of Israel doubted his death, so he brought him out for them to see “and indeed many of the people” meaning the people of Mecca “are heedless of Our signs” they do not consider them. “And We have certainly settled” We have settled “the Children of Israel in a place of truth” a place of honor, which is the Levant and Egypt “and We have provided for them from Good things, but they did not differ until knowledge came to them. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.
j-0445	If you, O Muhammad, are in doubt about the stories We have sent down to you as an obligation, then ask those who read the Book (the Torah) before you, for it is established with them and they will tell you of its truth. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: I do not doubt nor do I ask. The truth has come to you from your Lord, so do not be among those who doubt and doubt it. “And do not be among those who deny the signs of God, lest you be among the losers.” “Indeed, those upon whom the word of your Lord has come into effect” of punishment “will not believe” “even if every sign came to them until they see the painful punishment” then it will not benefit them at that time.
j-0446	«Why», «why was there not a town» I mean its people «that believed» before the punishment descended upon it «and its faith benefited it except» but «the people of Jonah, when they believed» upon seeing the sign of the punishment and did not delay until it came «We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world and gave them enjoyment for a time» the expiration of their terms. «And if your Lord had willed, those on earth would have believed, all of them together. Then would you compel people» with what God did not will from them «until they are believers?» No. «And it is not for a soul to believe except by permission of God» by His will «and to place the defilement» the punishment «on those who do not reason» ponder the signs of God. «Say» to the infidels of Mecca «Look at what» that is, what «is in the heavens and the earth» of the signs indicating the oneness of God Almighty «and the signs and the warners» the plural of warner, that is, the messengers «do not benefit a people who do not believe» in God’s knowledge, that is, what do they benefit? «So are they» what «await» in their denial of you «except like the days of those who passed on before them?» From the nations, that is, like their incidents of torment. “Say, ‘Then wait.’ That is, ‘I am with you among those who wait.’” “Then We will save Our messengers and those who believe. Thus, it is incumbent upon Us to save the believers.’” The Prophet and his companions when the polytheists were being tormented.
j-0447	“Say, O people,” that is, the people of Mecca, “if you are in doubt about my religion,” that it is true, “then I do not worship those you worship besides God,” that is, other than Him, which are idols, because of your doubt about it, “but I worship God, who takes your souls,” who takes your souls, “and I have been commanded,” that is, “to be among the believers,” “and” I was told, “to set your face toward the religion, inclining toward it, and do not be among those who associate others with God.” “And do not invoke,” worship, “besides God that which neither benefits you,” if you worship it, “nor harms you,” if you do not worship it, “then indeed you will be among the wrongdoers.”
j-0448	“And if Allah should touch you with harm” such as poverty or illness “there is none who can remove it” lift it “except Him. And if He intends for you good, there is none who can repel” “His bounty” which He intends for you. “He causes it” that is, with good “to whom He wills of His servants, and He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.” “Say, ‘O mankind, the truth has come to you from your Lord. So whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] himself” because the reward of his guidance is for him. “And whoever goes astray only goes astray to his own detriment” because the consequences of his going astray are upon him. “And I am not a guardian over you.” “And follow what is revealed to you” from your Lord. “And be patient” in the call and their harm “until Allah judges” concerning them according to His command. “And He is the best of judges” the most just of them. He was patient until he judged the polytheists to be fought and the People of the Book to pay the jizyah.
j-0449	"""Alif, Lam, Ra."" Allah knows best what He meant by that. This is ""a Book whose verses are perfected"" with amazing composition and wonderful meanings ""then detailed"" explained with rulings, stories and sermons ""from One Who is Wise and Acquainted"", that is, Allah. ""A"", that is, ""that you worship none but Allah. Indeed, I am to you from Him a warner"" of punishment if you disbelieve ""and a bearer of good tidings"" of reward if you believe. ""And that you seek forgiveness of your Lord"" from polytheism ""then repent"" return ""to Him"" ​​with obedience ""He will grant you"" in this world ""a good provision"" with good life and abundant provision ""for a specified term"" which is death ""and He will give"" in the Hereafter ""to every possessor of virtue"" in deeds ""His virtue"" his reward. ""But if you turn away"" in it, one of the two ta's is omitted, that is, you turn away ""then indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a great Day"" which is the Day of Resurrection. ""To Allah is your return, and He is over all things competent"", and from Him are reward and punishment. It was revealed, as narrated by Al-Bukhari on the authority of Ibn Abbas, regarding someone who was too shy to relieve himself or have intercourse, so he was seized by the sky. And before that, regarding the hypocrites, “Indeed, they turn away their breasts to hide from Him,” meaning God. “Indeed, when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows,” the Most High, “what they conceal and what they declare.” So their concealment is of no avail. “Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts,” meaning what is in the hearts."
j-0450	«And there is no creature on earth» that is, whatever creeps on it «but that upon Allah is its provision» that He guarantees it as a favor from Him, the Most High. «And He knows its place of dwelling» its dwelling in this world or on the loins «and its place of deposit» from death or in the womb. «All» that is mentioned «is in a clear Book» made clear, which is the Preserved Tablet. «And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days» the first of which was Sunday and the last of which was Friday «and His Throne» before He created them «was upon the water» and it was upon the wind «that He might test you» related to creation, that is, He created them and what is in them of benefits for you and interests, to test you «which of you is best in deed» that is, most obedient to Allah. «And if you say» O Muhammad to them, «Indeed, you will be resurrected after death, those who disbelieve will surely say, «This» what «is» the Qur’an that speaks of resurrection or what you say «is nothing but obvious magic» made clear, and in a reading a magician and the one referred to is the Prophet.
j-0451	"""And if We delay the punishment from them for a specified number of times, they will surely say, mockingly, 'What is holding it back?'"" God Almighty said, ""Behold, the Day it comes to them, it will not be averted from them, and that which they used to ridicule will encompass them."" Of the punishment. ""And if We let man, the disbeliever, taste mercy from Us, then We take it away from him, he is indeed despairing, despairing of God's mercy, ungrateful, extremely ungrateful to Him. ""And if We let him taste favor after adversity, poverty and hardship, has touched him, he will surely say, 'The evil deeds have gone away from me.'"" He did not expect them to go away, nor was he grateful for them. ""He is indeed exultant, proud, boastful, toward people for what he has been given. ""Except,"" but, ""those who are patient,"" in adversity, ""and do righteous deeds,"" in the favors, ""for them is forgiveness and a great reward,"" which is Paradise."
j-0452	“Perhaps you,” O Muhammad, “would leave some of what is revealed to you,” so that you do not convey it to them because of their negligence of it, “and your breast is constrained by it,” by reciting it to them, “lest they say, ‘Why was a treasure not sent down to him, or an angel come with him?’ You are only a warner,” so all you have to do is convey it, not do what they have suggested. “And God is Disposer of affairs,” a Guardian, so He will reward them.
j-0453	“Or” rather “do they say, ‘He has fabricated it’” meaning the Qur’an. “Say, ‘Then bring ten surahs like it’” in eloquence and rhetoric “that have been fabricated’” for you are eloquent Arabs like me. He challenged them with them first, then with another surah. “And call” to help in that “whoever you can besides God” meaning other than Him “if you should be truthful” that it is a fabrication. “But if” “they do not respond to you” meaning those whom you call to help “then know” addressing the polytheists “that it was only revealed” ambiguously “with the knowledge of God” and is not a fabrication against Him “and that” lightened, meaning that “there is no god but Him. So will you then submit” after this decisive argument, meaning submit
j-0454	“Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornment” by persisting in polytheism, and it was said that it refers to hypocrites, “We will fully repay them for their deeds therein” by expanding their provision, “and they therein” meaning this world “will not be deprived” will not be diminished in anything. “Those are the ones for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter except the Fire. And what they did therein will be in vain, and what they used to do will be futile.” “Then is one who is upon clear evidence from his Lord” meaning the Prophet or the believers, meaning the Qur’an, “and recites it” following it “a witness” for him of his truthfulness “from Him” meaning from God, meaning Gabriel, “and before it” the Qur’an “the Book of Moses” the Torah is also a witness for him “as an Imam and a mercy” a state like one who is not like that, no. “Those” meaning those who are upon clear evidence “believe in it” meaning the Qur’an, so they will have Paradise. “And whoever disbelieves in it from the parties” all the disbelievers “the Fire is his promised destination, so be not in doubt” doubt “about it” of the Qur’an. “It is the truth from your Lord, but most of the people” meaning the people of Mecca “do not believe.”
j-0455	"“And who” meaning no one “is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah” by attributing a partner and a son to Him. “Those will be brought before their Lord” on the Day of Resurrection among all creation. “And the witnesses” the plural of witness, which are the angels who testify for the messengers that they conveyed the message and against the disbelievers that they denied it, “These are the ones who lied against their Lord: ‘Unquestionably, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers’ the polytheists, “who bar [people] from the way of Allah” the religion of Islam, “and seek it” they seek the way “to make it crooked” “and they are, in the Hereafter, disbelievers’” (emphasis added). “Those were not able to frustrate” Allah “on earth, and they had not besides Allah” meaning other than Him “any protectors” who would prevent them from His punishment. “The punishment will be doubled for them” by their misleading others. “And they were not able to hear” of the truth, “nor were they able to see” (i.e. because of their extreme hatred for it), as if they were not able to do so. “Those are the ones who have lost their souls” because of their destination to the eternal Fire. “And what they invent” about Allah, claiming a partner, has gone astray” (i.e., disappeared) from them. ""It is truly a crime that they, in the Hereafter, will be the greatest losers."" ""Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds and humbled themselves toward their Lord - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally.""

'And we do not see for you any superiority over us,' so that you deserve to be followed by us. 'Rather, we think you are liars,' in claiming the message.

""Say, 'If I have fabricated it, upon me is my crime,' my sin, that is, its punishment. ""And I am innocent of what you commit,"" of your crime in attributing fabrication to me."
j-0458	And it was revealed to Noah that none of your people will believe except those who have already believed, so do not be sad or grieve over what they used to do of polytheism. So he called upon them, saying, “My Lord, do not leave [anything] on the earth,” etc. So God answered his call and said, “And construct the ark,” the ship, “under Our eyes,” in Our sight and protection, “and with Our revelation,” “and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged,” who disbelieved by not destroying them, “for they are to be drowned.”

j-0460	"""And Noah said, ""Embark therein, in the name of God is its course and its anchorage.""

""The wife of al-'Aziz said when she saw what had happened to them ""so these"" this is ""the one who “I have tried to seduce him, but he refused.

j-0485	“He said, ‘My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not turn away from me their plot, I will incline toward them and be among the ignorant, the sinners.’” The intention of that is the supplication, so God Almighty said, “So his Lord responded to him,” his supplication, “and turned away from him their plot. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing,” of the statement, “the Knowing,” of the action. “Then it appeared,” it became apparent, “to them, after they had seen the signs,” indicating Joseph’s innocence, that they should imprison him. This is indicated by “to imprison him until,” until “a time,” in which people’s speech would cease, so he was imprisoned.”

""And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It was not,"" it was appropriate, ""for us to associate anything with God,"" an extra ""word,"" to protect us from that."" Monotheism “is from the grace of Allah upon us and upon mankind, but most of the people” and they are the disbelievers “do not give thanks” to Allah and associate partners with Him. Then He explicitly called them to faith, saying: “O my two companions” the inhabitants of “the prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Prevailing?” “O Allah,” is a question of confirmation. “What you worship besides Him” that is, other than Him “is only names which you have named” which you have named idols with, “you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down” according to their custom “no authority” argument and proof. “Indeed,” what “the judgment,” the decree, “is only Allah’s,” alone. “He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That” monotheism “is the right religion,” the straight one. “But most of the people,” and they are the disbelievers, “do not know” what punishment they will end up in, so they associate partners with Him. “O my two companions of the prison, as for one of you,” that is, the cupbearer, he will be released after three days, “he will give his lord” his master “wine to drink,” according to his custom. “As for the other,” he will be released after three days, “he will be crucified and the birds will eat from his head.” This is the interpretation of your vision. They said, “We have not seen anything.” He said, “It has been decided,” it is done. ""The matter about which you two are asking a question"" you asked about it, whether you told the truth or lied. ""And he said to the one whom he thought"" he was certain ""that he would be saved from the two of them"" he was the cupbearer ""mention me to your Lord"" your master, so tell him that there is a boy in the prison who has been unjustly imprisoned and has been released.

""Then there will come after that"" meaning the seven barren years ""a year in which people will be given relief"" by rain ""and in which they will press"" grapes and other things due to its fertility"

""And the king said, ""Bring him to me, I will select him for myself"" make him exclusively for me without a partner. So the messenger came to him and said, ""Answer the king.""

In the story, the king headed and sealed him and appointed him in place of the Aziz He removed him and died after that, so he married his wife to him and found her to be a virgin and she bore him two sons. He established justice in Egypt and the necks submitted to him. “We bestow Our mercy upon whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of the righteous.” “And the reward of the Hereafter is better” than the reward of this world “for those who believe and are righteous.” Years of famine entered and struck the land of Canaan and the Levant."

In the two hamzas in the two places, and the realization of the first, and the facilitation of the second, and the insertion of an alif between them in both ways and leaving it, and in a reading with the question in the first and the news in the second and another and the opposite, “Those are the ones who disbelieved in their Lord, and those are the shackles on their necks, and those are the companions of the Fire, they will abide therein eternally.” And the punishment was revealed in their hastening of the punishment in mockery. “And they urge you to hasten the evil” the punishment “before the good” the mercy “and before them there have been examples” the plural of example with the weight of fruit, meaning the punishments of their likes from the disbelievers, so will they not take heed of them. “And indeed, your Lord is full of forgiveness for the people despite” despite “their wrongdoing” otherwise He would not have left a creature on its back. “And indeed, your Lord is severe in penalty” for those who disobey Him. “And those who disbelieve say, ‘Why did He not send down the punishment?’” Upon him” upon Muhammad “is a sign from his Lord” like the staff, the hand, and the camel. God Almighty said, “You are only a warner” frightening the disbelievers, and it is not upon you to bring the signs “and for every people there is a guide” a prophet who calls them to their Lord with the signs he gives them, not with what they suggest.
j-0503	“Allah knows what every female carries” of male and female, single and multiple, and other than that. “And what the wombs absorb” of the period of pregnancy “and what they gain” of it. “And everything with Him is by measure” according to a limit that He does not exceed. “The Knower of the unseen and the witnessed” of what is hidden and what is seen. “The Great” the Great “The Exalted” over His creation by force with a “ya” and below it. “Alike among you” in His knowledge, the Most High, “whether he conceals his speech or declares it aloud or he who conceals it” hidden “by night” in its darkness “or travels” apparent by going in his flock, that is, his path “by day.” “For him” for man “are angels who follow him” before him “and behind him” behind him “who guard him by the command of Allah” that is, by His command of the jinn and others. “Indeed, Allah does not change the condition of a people” He does not take away His blessings “until they change what is in themselves” of the beautiful state by disobedience. “And when Allah intends evil for a people” punishment “there is no repelling it” from the guardians or anything else. “And there is for them” for whom God intended evil for them “other than Him” meaning other than God “from” the redundant “and” to prevent it from them
j-0504	“It is He who shows you lightning, causing fear” for travelers from thunderbolts “and hope” for the resident for rain “and produces” creates “heavy clouds” with rain “and the thunder glorifies” is an angel assigned to the clouds who drives them while wearing it “with His praise” that is, he says, “Glory be to God and praise be to Him” “and” the angels glorify “for fear of Him” that is, God “and sends thunderbolts” which is fire that comes out of the clouds “and strikes with it whomever He wills” burning him. It was revealed about a man to whom the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, sent someone to call him and he said, “Who is the Messenger of God and what is God? Is he of gold or silver or copper?” So a thunderbolt struck him and took the skull of his head “and they” that is, the disbelievers “dispute” they dispute with the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace “about God, and He is severe in penalty” strength or taking.
j-0505	“To Him” the Most High “is the call of truth” that is, His word, which is there is no god but God. “And those who call upon” with the letter “ya” and the letter “ta” they worship “besides Him” that is, other than Him, and they are the idols. “They do not respond to them with anything” of what they ask for “except” a response “like one who extends” that is, like the response of one who extends “his hands to the water” on the edge of the well calling to Him “that it may reach his mouth” by rising from the well to it “but it will never reach it” that is, his mouth, so likewise they will not respond to them. “And the call of the disbelievers” their worship of idols or the reality of the call “is only in error” loss. “And to God prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly” like the believers “and by compulsion” like the hypocrites and whoever is forced by the sword “and” prostrates “their shadows in the mornings” the early hours “and the evenings” the evenings. “Say” O Muhammad to your people “Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: “Allah” if they do not say it, there is no answer other than Him. “Say” to them: “Have you then taken besides Him” that is, Other than Him, “guardians” idols that you worship “who do not possess for themselves any benefit or harm” and you have left their owner. This is a question of rebuke. “Say, ‘Are the blind and the seeing equal?’ the disbeliever and the believer. ‘Or are the darknesses equal?’ disbelief. ‘And the light?’ faith. No. “Or have they attributed to God partners who created like His creation so that the creation became alike to them?” meaning partners to God’s creation. “To them,” so they believed that they deserved to be worshipped because of their creation. This is a question of denial. This is not the case, and no one deserves worship except the Creator. “Say, ‘God is the Creator of all things.’ He has no partner in it, so there is no partner for Him in worship. ‘And He is the One, the Prevailing.’” of His servants. Then He gave an example of truth and falsehood, saying, “He sent down from the sky water,” rain. “And valleys flowed according to their capacity,” according to the capacity of filling them. “Then the flood carried a swelling foam,” rising on it, which is what is on its surface of filth and the like. “And from that which you kindle,” with the ta’ and the ya’, “for it in the fire,” of the gems of the earth such as gold, silver, and copper. “He sought it,” sought, “an ornament.” “Or a benefit” that is used, such as vessels when they are melted, “a foam like it” meaning like the foam of a torrent, which is its impurity that is removed by the bellows. “Thus” mentioned, “God sets forth the truth and falsehood” meaning their like. “As for the foam” from the torrent and what it has kindled of gems, “it vanishes as scum” falsehood thrown away. “As for what benefits people” of water and gems, “it remains” remains “in the earth” for a period of time. Thus falsehood vanishes and is obliterated, even if it rises above the truth at some times, and the truth is fixed and remains. “Thus” mentioned, “God sets forth” explains “the examples.”
j-0506	"“For those who responded to their Lord” responded to Him with obedience “is the best” Paradise “and those who did not respond to Him” and they are the disbelievers “if they had all that is in the earth and as much more with it, they would ransom themselves with it” from the punishment “for those is the evil of the reckoning” which is the punishment for everything they knew, nothing of it will be forgiven “and their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place” the bed is

It was revealed about Hamza and Abu Jahl “Is he who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth” so he believed in it “like one who is blind” who does not know it and does not believe in it “only those who remember” are admonished “those of understanding” the people of reason

“who fulfill the covenant of Allah” taken from them while they are in the world of the atoms or every covenant “and do not break the contract” by abandoning oaths or obligations

“and those who maintain what Allah has commanded to be maintained” of faith and kinship and other things “and fear their Lord” that is, His threat “and fear the evil of the reckoning” a similar example has come before

“and those who are patient” in obedience And the affliction and from disobedience “seeking” seeking “the face of their Lord” and nothing else from the worldly affairs “and they establish prayer and spend” in obedience “from what We have provided for them secretly and publicly and they repel” repel “evil with good” such as ignorance with patience and harm with patience “those will have the final home” meaning the praiseworthy outcome in the Hereafter which is “Gardens of Eden” a residence “which they will enter” they “and whoever was righteous” believed “among their fathers and their spouses and their descendants” even if they did not know about their deeds they will be in their degrees as an honor to them “and the angels will enter upon them from every gate” of the gates of Paradise or the palaces when they first enter to congratulate them
They say “Peace be upon you” this is the reward “for what you patiently endured” for your patience in this world “so excellent is the final home” your final home"
j-0507	“And those who break the covenant of Allah after its ratification and sever that which Allah has commanded to be joined and spread corruption on earth” through disbelief and sins “for those is the curse” distance from Allah’s mercy “and for them is the worst home” the bad end in the Hereafter, which is Hell. “Allah expands provision” expands it “for whom He wills and restricts it” restricts it for whom He wills “and they rejoice” that is, the people of Mecca with arrogant joy “in the life of this world” that is, in what they have attained in it “and the life of this world is not” compared to the life of “the Hereafter except a temporary enjoyment” something small that is enjoyed and then goes away. “And those who disbelieve” from the people of Mecca “say, ‘Why was not sent down to him’ to Muhammad “a sign from his Lord” such as the staff, the hand, and the she-camel? Say” to them, “Indeed, Allah leaves astray whom He wills” misguides him, so the signs do not avail Him at all “and guides” directs “to it” to His religion “whoever turns back” returns to Him and changes from whomever
j-0508	“Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of God” meaning His promise. “Unquestionably, by the remembrance of God hearts are assured” meaning the hearts of the believers. “Those who have believed and done righteous deeds” is a subject whose predicate is “blessed” is a source of goodness or a tree in Paradise in whose shade a rider can travel for a hundred years without crossing it. “For them is a good place of return” is a reference.
j-0509	“Thus,” just as We sent the prophets before you, “We have sent you to a nation before which there have been nations that have passed on, that you may recite to them that which We have revealed to you,” that is, the Qur’an, “while they disbelieve in the Most Gracious,” when they said when they were commanded to prostrate to Him, “and what is the Most Gracious?” “Say,” to them, O Muhammad, “He is my Lord; there is no god but Him. In Him I rely, and to Him is my return.” And it was revealed when they said to him, “If you are a prophet, then move away from us the mountains of Mecca and make for us therein rivers and springs so that we may plant and sow, and send for us our dead fathers to speak to us, that you are a prophet.” “And if a Qur’an were to move mountains,” to be moved from their places, “or split the earth,” to split “or speak to the dead,” to bring them back to life, they would not have believed. “Rather, to God belongs the entire command,” not to anyone else, so only he who He wishes to believe believes, and no one else does, if they are given what they proposed. And it was revealed when the Companions wanted to make known what they proposed, hoping for their belief. “Have those who believe not despaired,” lightened, that is, that “if God had willed, He would have guided the people.” All of them” to faith without a sign “And those who disbelieved” from the people of Mecca “will continue to be afflicted by what they have done” by their doing, that is, their disbelief “a calamity will strike them” a disaster that strikes them with various types of calamity from killing and captivity and war and drought “or it will descend” O Muhammad with your army “near their home” Mecca “until the promise of God comes” of victory over them “for God does not fail in His promise” and it occurred at Hudaybiyyah until the conquest of Mecca came “And messengers were mocked before you” just as you were mocked and this is a consolation for the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace “but I granted respite” I gave respite “to those who disbelieved and then I seized them” with the punishment “so how was My punishment” that is, it will take its place so I will do the same to those who mocked you “Is he who is standing” a watcher “over every soul for what it has earned” it has done of good and evil and he is God like he who is not like that from the idols there is no evidence for this “and they have made partners to God Say, “Name them” to Him who they are “or” rather “do you inform Him” you inform God “of” that is With a partner “who does not know” “on the earth” is a question of denial, meaning that He has no partner, for if He had knowledge, He would have been above that. “Or” rather, you call them partners “on the outward appearance of speech” with a false assumption that has no truth in the heart. “Rather, their plot has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, their disbelief, and they have averted from the path” the path of guidance. “And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no guide.” “For them is a punishment in the life of this world” by killing and captivity. “And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe” more severe than it. “And they have no protector from Allah” that is, His punishment. “Any protector” to prevent it.
j-0510	“Like” an attribute “of Paradise which the righteous have been promised” subject, its predicate is omitted, that is, in what we have related to you, “with rivers flowing beneath it, its food” what is eaten therein “is everlasting” does not perish, “and its shade” is everlasting, the sun does not remove it because it is not in it, “that” that is Paradise “is the consequence” the end “of those who feared” polytheism “and the consequence of the disbelievers is the Fire.”
j-0511	“And those to whom We gave the Scripture” such as Abdullah ibn Salam and other believing Jews “rejoice in what has been revealed to you” because it agrees with what they have. “And among the parties” who formed parties against you with enmity from the polytheists and the Jews “are those who deny some of it” such as the mention of the Most Gracious and other than the stories. “Say, ‘I have only been commanded’ in what has been revealed to me “to” that is, to “worship God and not associate anything with Him. To Him I call, and to Him is my return.” “And thus” the revelation “We have revealed it” that is, the Qur’an “as an Arabic judgment” in the language of the Arabs by which you judge between people. “And if you were to follow their desires” that is, the disbelievers in what they call you to of their religion as an obligation “after what has come to you of knowledge” of monotheism “you will have from God no” redundant “protector” helper “or protector” to prevent His punishment.
j-0512	And when they insulted him for his many women, he revealed: “And We had certainly sent messengers before you, and We made for them wives and offspring,” children, and you are like them. “And it is not for a messenger” from them “to bring a sign except by permission of Allah,” because they are slaves who are raised. “For every term” is a period “a book” written in which its definition is determined. “Allah erases” from it “what He wills and confirms” with the emphasis and with it the rulings and other things. “And with Him is the Mother of the Book” its original from which nothing changes, and it is what He wrote in eternity. “And either” in it is the assimilation of the conditional “nun” in the additional “ma” “We show you some of what We promise them” with it of torment from your life, and the answer to the condition is omitted, meaning that is it “or We take you” before their torment “then upon you is only the notification” upon you is only the notification “and upon Us is the reckoning” when they come to Us, so We reward them. “Or have they not seen” meaning the people of Mecca “that We come to the land” meaning their land “and reduce it from its borders” with the fat-ha on the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace “and God judges” in His creation. As He wills. “There is no adjuster” no repeller “of His judgment, and He is swift in reckoning.” “And those before them plotted” against their prophets as they plotted against you. “But to God belongs all plotting.” Their plotting is not like His plotting, because He, the Most High, “knows what every soul earns.” He prepares for it its recompense, and this is the whole plotting, because He will bring it to them from where they do not perceive. “And the disbeliever will know” what is meant by it is the species, and in the reading of the disbelievers “for whom is the final home?” meaning the praiseworthy end in the Hereafter, is it for them or for the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and his companions. “And those who disbelieve say” to you, “You are not a messenger.” Say to them, “Sufficient is God as a witness between me and you,” of my truthfulness, “and those with knowledge of the Book” from among the believing Jews and Christians.

j-0514	"“And We sent Moses with Our signs,” the nine, and We said to him, “bring out your people,” the Children of Israel, “from darkness,” disbelief, “into the light,” faith, “and remind them of the days of God,” His blessings. “Indeed in that,” the reminder, “are signs for everyone patient,” in obedience, “grateful,” for blessings. “And,” remember, “when Moses said to his people, ‘Remember the favor of God upon you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with terrible torment and slaughtering your sons,” the newborns, “and sparing,” they were leaving “your women,” because some of the priests said that a newborn child would be born among the Children of Israel, which would be the cause of Pharaoh’s kingdom going away. “And in that,” the deliverance or the torment, “is a trial,” a favor or a test, “from your Lord, a great one.” “And when your Lord proclaimed,” I know, “If you are grateful,” My blessings through monotheism and obedience, “I will surely increase you; but if you are ungrateful,” you deny the blessing through disbelief and disobedience, I will surely punish you. Indeed, My punishment is severe.”

Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, with clear arguments for their truthfulness, but they put their hands to their mouths, in order to bite them out of intense anger, and said, ‘Indeed, we have disbelieved in that with which you have been sent,’ according to your claim, ‘and indeed, we are in doubt about that to which you invite us, disquieting.’ Their messengers said, ‘Is there any doubt about Allah?’ A question of denial, there is no doubt about His Oneness, due to the apparent evidence for Him, ‘the Creator of the heavens and the earth, who invites you, to obey Him, ‘that He may forgive you some of your sins,’ ‘from’ is redundant, for Islam forgives what came before it, or it is a partial particle to remove the rights of the servants, ‘and to delay you,’ without punishment, ‘until a specified term, the term of death. They said, ‘You are only human beings like us.’” You want to turn us away from what our fathers used to worship, idols. “Then bring us a clear authority,” a clear proof of your truthfulness. “Their messengers said to them, ‘We are only human beings like you,’ as you said. ‘But God bestows favor upon whomever He wills of His servants. And it was not for us to bring you any authority except by God’s permission. And in God let the believers put their trust.

j-0518	“And they shall come forth,” that is, all creatures, and the expression in it and what follows it is in the past tense to confirm its occurrence, “to God all together. Then the weak ones,” the followers, “said to those who were arrogant,” the ones who were led, “Indeed, we were your followers,” the plural of follower, “so can you protect us from the punishment of God at all?” The first is for clarification and the second is for partiality. “They,” the ones who were led, “said, ‘If God had guided us, we would have guided you,’ we would have called you to guidance. It is the same for us whether we are impatient or patient. There is for us no refuge,” an extra “escape,” a refuge. “And Satan,” Iblis, “said when the matter had been decided,” and the people of Paradise entered Paradise and the people of Hell entered Hell and they gathered against him, “Indeed, God promised you the promise of truth,” of resurrection and recompense, so He fulfilled it for you. “And I promised you,” that it would not happen, “but I broke my promise to you. And I had no authority over you,” an extra “power,” power and ability to force you to follow me, “except,” but “that I called you and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves,” for responding to me, “I will not be your savior.” By your helper, “and you are not my helpers,” with the opening of the ya’ and its breaking, “I have disbelieved in what you associated,” with your associating me with God, “before,” of the world. God Almighty said, “Indeed, the wrongdoers,” the disbelievers, “will have a painful punishment,” painful. “And those who believe and do righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, abiding therein eternally,” a presumed state, “with permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein,” from God and the angels and among themselves, “is peace.”
j-0519	"“Have you not seen” you look “how Allah presents a parable” and replaces it with “a good word” meaning there is no god but Allah “like a good tree” which is the palm tree “whose root is firm” in the earth “and its branch” its twig “is in the heaven”
“brings” gives “its fruit” its fruit “at all times by the permission of its Lord” by His will. Likewise the word of faith is fixed in the heart of the believer and his work ascends to the heaven and he receives its blessing and reward at all times. “And Allah presents” explains “parables for the people that perhaps they will be reminded” take heed and believe.
“And the parable of a bad word” which is the word of disbelief “is like a bad tree” which is the colocynth “uprooted” was uprooted “from the surface of the earth, having no stability” stable and firm. Likewise the word of disbelief has no stability, no branch, and no blessing.
“Allah establishes those who believe with the firm word” which is the word of monotheism “in the life of this world and in the Hereafter” meaning in the grave when the two angels ask them about their Lord, their religion, and their Prophet, and they answer correctly as in the hadith of the two sheikhs. “And Allah leaves astray the wrongdoers” the disbelievers, so they do not They are not guided to the correct answer, but they say we do not know, as in the hadith: “And God does what He wills.”"
j-0520	“Have you not seen those who have exchanged the favor of Allah for disbelief?” They are the disbelievers of Quraysh. “And have allowed their people to enter the abode of destruction.” Hell is an explanatory apposition. “They will enter it and wretched is the resting place.” “And they have set up rivals to Allah” partners “that they may lead astray” with the opening of the ya’ and the closing of the ya’ “from His way” the religion of Islam. “Say” to them, “Enjoy your worldly life for a little while, for your destination” your return “is the Fire.”
j-0521	"“Say to My servants who have believed that they should establish prayer and spend from what We have provided for them, secretly and publicly, before there comes a Day in which there will be no exchange or friendship, that is, the Day of Resurrection. 

“It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky, and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. And He has subjected to you the ships, that they may sail upon the sea, by His command, and has subjected to you the rivers. 

“And He has subjected to you the sun and the moon, both diligently pursuing their courses, and He has subjected to you the night and the day, that you may seek of His bounty, and He has given you of all that you have asked of Him, according to your interests.

j-0522	“And” remember “when Abraham said, ‘My Lord, make this city’” Mecca “a place of security” secure. And God answered his prayer and made it a sanctuary in which no human blood is shed, no one is wronged, no game is hunted, and no vegetation is abandoned. “And spare me” after me “and my sons” from “worshipping idols.” “My Lord, indeed they” that is, the idols “have led astray many people” by their worship of them. “But whoever follows me” in monotheism “he is of me” from the people of my religion. “And whoever disobeys me, You are indeed Forgiving and Merciful.” This was before he knew that God Almighty does not forgive polytheism. “Our Lord, indeed I have settled some of my descendants” that is, some of them, that is, Ishmael with his mother Hagar “in an uncultivated valley” that is, Mecca “near Your sacred House” that was before the Flood. “Our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make the hearts” hearts “of the people incline” incline and yearn “toward them.” Ibn Abbas said that if he had said the hearts of the people, the Persians and the Romans and all the people would have yearned for him. “And provide them with fruits.” Perhaps they will be grateful.” And he did by transferring the Taif to him. “Our Lord, indeed You know what we conceal” “and what we declare, and nothing is hidden from Allah” “on earth or in heaven” It is possible that it is from His words, the Most High, or the words of Abraham. “Praise be to Allah, who has given me” “upon” “my old age, Ishmael” “a son when he was ninety-nine years old” “and Isaac” “a son when he was one hundred and twelve years old” “Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of supplication.” “My Lord, make me an establisher of prayer and” “make” “from my descendants” and whoever establishes it and he brought those to inform Allah, the Most High, that among them are disbelievers “Our Lord and accept the supplication” mentioned. “Our Lord, forgive me and my parents” This was before their enmity towards Allah, the Almighty, became clear to him. It was said that his mother submitted and my parents were read in the singular and my children “and for the believers on the Day when the reckoning will be established” Allah, the Most High, said

It is said that someone’s eyes stared, meaning he opened them and did not close them. “Rushing,” in a hurry, “with their heads raised,” to the sky, “their glances will not return to them,” their sight, “and their hearts,” their hearts, “are empty,” devoid of reason because of their fear. “And warn,” fear, O Muhammad, “the people,” the disbelievers, “of the Day when the punishment will come to them,” that is, the Day of Resurrection, “and those who did wrong,” disbelieved, “will say, ‘Our Lord, delay us,’ by returning us to this world, “for a near term. We will answer Your call,” to monotheism, “and follow the messengers,” so it will be said to them in rebuke. “Have you not sworn,” swore, “before,” in this world, “that you would not,” an extra “removal,” from it to the Hereafter? “And you dwelt,” in it, “in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves,” by disbelief from the previous nations, “and it has become clear to you.” How did We deal with them? "" Of punishment, so you were not deterred. ""And We presented"" clearly ""for you examples"" in the Qur'an, so you did not take heed. They plotted against the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, their plot, where they wanted to kill him, or restrain him, or expel him. And with God is their plot, that is, He knows it or its reward. And whatever their plot was, even if it was so great that mountains would move from it, meaning that it is not to be paid attention to and it does not harm anyone but themselves. And what is meant by the mountains here is said to be their reality. And it is said that the laws of Islam are similar to them in stability and steadfastness. And in a reading with the opening of the lam of ""to move"" and raising the verb ""if"", it is lightened and what is meant is the magnification of their plot. And it is said that what is meant by the plot is their disbelief, and it is appropriate for the second: The heavens almost burst from it, and the earth splits open, and the mountains collapse in devastation. And on the first, what was read is what was not"

Remember the Day when the earth will be replaced by another earth, and the heavens as well. It is the Day of Resurrection, when people will be gathered on a pure white earth, as in the hadith of the two Sahihs. Muslim narrated a hadith in which the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was asked, “Where are the people on that Day?” He said, “On the Bridge.” They will emerge. They will emerge from the graves for Allah, the One, the Subduer.

«And you will see» O Muhammad, you will see «the criminals» the disbelievers «on that Day bound together» bound with their devils «in chains» chained with their devils «in fetters» the shackles or chains «their garments» their shirts «of pitch» because it is more eloquent due to the blazing fire «and the Fire will cover» the faces «of it» «that Allah may recompense» related to «they will emerge» «every soul for what it has earned» of good and evil «for Allah is swift in account» He will hold all creation accountable in the space of half a day of the days of this world, according to a hadith of that effect
«This» the Qur’an «is a message for mankind» that is, it was revealed to inform them «and that they may be warned thereby and that they may know» by what It contains the arguments: “He” meaning God “is only one God, and let those of understanding” by assimilating the ta’ in the original into the dhal “be admonished” by “those of understanding” meaning the people of reason."

God Almighty said, “The angels do not descend” in which one of the two ta’s is omitted “except with the truth” with punishment. “And they were not then” that is, when the angels descend with the punishment “reprieed” delayed. “Indeed, it is We” confirming the name of “in” or separating “who sent down the Reminder” the Qur’an “and indeed, We will be its guardian” from alteration, distortion, addition, or subtraction.

It was said that this is a metaphor for the corruption of what they had planned of plotting against the messengers. ‘Then On the Day of Resurrection, He will disgrace them, humiliate them, and He will say to them, through the tongues of the angels, as a rebuke, “Where are My partners,” according to your claim, “about whom you used to quarrel,” disagree with the believers, “in regard to them,” concerning them. “Those who were given knowledge,” of the prophets and believers, “said, ‘Indeed, disgrace and evil will be upon the disbelievers today,’” they say it in mockery of them, “whom the angels take in death while they are wronging themselves,” by disbelief, “so they submit and surrender at death, saying, ‘We did not do any evil,’ polytheism.

But if you are patient” from taking revenge “it is” that is, patience “that is better for the patient” so the Prophet (peace and blessings of God be upon him) refrained and expiated his oath. Al-Bazzar narrated it. “And be patient, and your patience is not but through God” with His guidance “and do not grieve over them” that is, the disbelievers if they do not believe because of your concern for their belief “and do not be in distress over what they plot” that is, do not worry about their plotting, for I am your helper against them. “Indeed, God is with those who fear God and those who do good through obedience and patience, with help and victory.
j-0566	Glory be to Him Who took His servant Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, by night. The accusative is the circumstance, and the night journey is the journey of the night. The benefit of mentioning it is to indicate by its indefiniteness the reduction of its duration from the Sacred Mosque to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the Holy House, due to its distance from it, which We have blessed around it with fruits and rivers, to show him from Our signs the wonders of Our power. Indeed, He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing. That is, the Knower of the sayings and actions of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace. So He bestowed upon him the Night Journey, which included his meeting with the prophets and his ascension to the heavens and seeing the wonders of the kingdom and his supplication to God Almighty. For he, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: I was brought Al-Buraq, which is a white beast larger than a donkey and smaller than a mule, placing its hoof where it reaches its sight. So I rode it and it traveled with me until I came to the Holy House. I tied the beast to the ring in which the prophets are tied, then I entered and prayed two rak’ahs in it, then I came out and Gabriel came to me with a vessel of wine and a vessel of milk, so I chose the milk. Gabriel said: You have found the fitrah. He said: Then I was taken up to the lowest heaven, and Gabriel asked for the opening. It was said: Who are you? Gabriel said: It was said: Who is with you? He said: Muhammad, it was said, or he was sent to him. He said, he was sent to him, so it was opened for us, and I saw Adam, so he welcomed me and prayed for goodness for me. Then he ascended with me to the second heaven. Gabriel asked for it to be opened, and it was said, “Who are you?” Gabriel said, “Who is with you?” He said, “Muhammad.” It was said, “Or he was sent to him?” He said, “He was sent to him.” So it was opened for us, and I saw my maternal cousins, John and Jesus, so they welcomed me and prayed for goodness for me. Then he ascended with us to the third heaven. Gabriel asked for it to be opened, and it was said, “Who are you?” Gabriel said, “Who is with you?” He said, “Muhammad.” It was said, “Or he was sent to him?” He said, “He was sent to him.” So it was opened for us, and I saw Joseph, so he welcomed me and prayed for goodness for me. Then he ascended with us to the fourth heaven. Gabriel asked for it to be opened, and it was said, “Who are you?” Gabriel said, “Who is with you?” He said, “Muhammad.” It was said, “Or he was sent to him?” He said, “He was sent to him.” So it was opened for us, and I saw Idris, so he welcomed me and prayed for goodness for me. Then he ascended with us to the fifth heaven. Gabriel asked for it to be opened, and it was said, “Who are you?” Gabriel said, “Who is with you?” He said, “Muhammad.” It was said, “Or he was sent to him?” He said, “He was sent to him.” So it was opened for us, and I saw Aaron, so he welcomed me and prayed for goodness for me. Then he ascended with us to the sixth heaven and Gabriel asked for it to be opened. It was said, “Who are you?” Gabriel said, “Who is with you?” He said, “Muhammad.” It was said, “Or has he been sent to him?” He said, “He has been sent to him.” So it was opened for us and there I was Moses. He welcomed me and prayed for good for me. Then he ascended with us to the seventh heaven and Gabriel asked for it to be opened. It was said, “Who are you?” Gabriel said, “Who is with you?” He said, “Muhammad.” It was said, “Or has he been sent to him?” He said, “He has been sent to him.” So it was opened for us and there I was Abraham. He was leaning against the Frequented House and seventy thousand angels enter it every day and they do not return to it. Then he went to the Lote Tree of the Limit and its leaves were like elephants’ ears and its fruit was like jars. When what covered it from the command of Allah covered it, it changed. No one among Allah’s creation can describe its beauty. Then Allah revealed to me what He revealed and imposed on me fifty prayers every day and night. So I came down until I reached Moses and he said, “What did your Lord impose on your nation?” I said, “Fifty prayers every day and night.” He said, “Go back to your Lord and ask Him to make things easier for your nation, for your nation cannot bear that, and I have tested the Children of Israel.” And I told them. He said: So I went back to my Lord and said: O Lord, lighten the burden on my nation. So He reduced five for me. So I went back to Moses. He said: What did you do? I said: He has reduced five for me. He said: Your nation cannot bear that. So go back to your Lord and ask Him to lighten it for your nation. He said: So I kept going back and forth between my Lord and Moses and He reduced five by five for me until He said: O Muhammad, they are five prayers every day and night. For every prayer ten, so that is fifty prayers. And whoever intends to do a good deed but does not do it, a good deed is written for him. If he does it, ten are written for him. And whoever intends to do a bad deed but does not do it, it is not written for him. If he does it, one bad deed is written for him. So I went down until I reached Moses and informed him. He said: Go back to your Lord and ask Him to lighten it, for your nation cannot bear that. So I said: I have gone back to my Lord until I felt ashamed. Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, and the wording is from Muslim. Al-Hakim narrated in Al-Mustadrak on the authority of Ibn Abbas, who said: The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: I saw my Lord, the Mighty and Sublime.
j-0567	"God Almighty said: “And We gave Moses the Scripture” the Torah “and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel” for “A” “N” “that they should not take besides Me a guardian” to whom they entrust their affairs. In another reading, “take” with the upper particle “indeed he was a grateful servant” very grateful to Us, praising Us in all his circumstances. “And We decreed” We revealed “to the Children of Israel in the Scripture” the Torah “that you will surely cause corruption in the land” the land of Ash-Sham with sins “twice and you will surely reach a great haughtiness” you seek great transgression. “So when the first of the two promises came” the first of the two times of corruption “We sent against you servants of Ours of great might” possessed of strength in war and violence “and they swept” they went back and forth seeking you “throughout the dwellings” in the midst of your dwellings to kill you and take you captive “and it was a promise fulfilled” and they had corrupted the first by killing Zachariah, so He sent against them Goliath and his soldiers, who killed them and took their children captive and struck between the sanctuaries. “Then We gave you back the upper hand” the state and the victory “over them” after a hundred years by killing Goliath “and We reinforced you with wealth and children and made you more numerous” clan

And We said “If you do good” in obedience “you do good for yourselves” because its reward is for it “and if you do evil” in corruption “it is for yourselves” your evil “so when the promise comes” the “last” time “we will send them” “to disfigure your faces” to grieve you with killing and captivity with a grief that will appear on your faces “and to enter the mosque” the Holy House and destroy it “as they entered it” and destroyed it “the first time and to destroy” to annihilate “what they had prevailed over” they had overcome “with utter destruction” destruction and they corrupted a second time by killing John, so He sent against them Bukhtanasr who killed thousands of them and took their descendants captive and destroyed the Holy House

And We said in the Book “Perhaps your Lord will have mercy on you” after the second time “if you repent” “and if you return” to corruption “we will return” to punishment and they returned by denying Muhammad May God bless him and grant him peace. He imposed on them the killing of Qurayzah, the expulsion of Nadir, and the imposition of the jizya on them. “And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers,” a confinement and a prison."
j-0568	“Indeed, this Qur’an guides to that which is most upright” that is, the most just and correct way “and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward.” “And” it informs “that those who do not believe in the Hereafter - We have prepared for them a painful punishment” painful, which is the Fire. “And man invokes evil” for himself and his family if he is bored “with his invocation” that is, like his invocation for good “and man” the species “is ever hasty” in invoking evil upon himself and not considering his consequences.
j-0569	"“And We have made the night and the day two signs,” indicating Our power. “So We have erased the sign of the night,” obliterated its light with darkness so that you may rest therein. The addition is for clarification. “And We have made the sign of the day visible,” that is, visible in it with light. “That you may seek,” in it, “bounty from your Lord,” by earning, “and that you may know,” by them, “the number of years and the reckoning,” of times. “And everything,” that is needed, “We have explained in detail.” “And every human being We have fastened his fate,” his deeds, which he carries, “to his neck,” he was specifically mentioned because the attachment is more severe in it. Mujahid said that no newborn is born except that on his neck is a paper written on it, whether he is wretched or happy. “And We will bring forth for him on the Day of Resurrection a book,” written in it his deeds, “which he will find spread out,” two attributes of a book. “And it will be said to him, ‘Read your book. Sufficient is your soul against you this Day as a reckoner,’” an accountant. “Whoever is guided is guided only for himself,” because the reward for his guidance is for him. “And whoever goes astray only goes astray against himself,” because his sin is upon him. “And no soul will bear any burden.” ""A burdensome soul"" is a sinner, meaning it does not bear ""the burden"" of another soul. ""And We never punish"" anyone ""until We send a messenger"" to explain to him what is required of him. ""And when We desire to destroy a city, We command its affluent ones"", meaning its leaders, to obey through the tongues of Our messengers ""but they defiantly disobey therein"", so they disobey Our command ""so the word comes into effect upon it"" of punishment ""and We destroy it with [complete] destruction"" We destroy it by destroying its people and ruining it. ""And how many"", meaning many ""have We destroyed of generations"" nations ""after Noah?

""And your Lord has decreed"" that is, that ""you worship none but Him"" ​​and that you be good ""to your parents"" by being dutiful to them. ""Whether one of them attains old age [while] with you"" is the subject ""or both of them"" and in another reading ""reaches old age"", one of them is a substitute for its alif. ""So say not to them a word of disrespect"" with the opening of the fa and its breaking with a tanween or without a tanween, a source meaning damnation and disgrace. ""And lower to them the wing of humility"" because you are humiliated to them ""out of mercy"" that is, out of your tenderness towards them. ""And say, 'My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small.'"" ""Your Lord is most knowing of what is in your souls"" of concealing righteousness and disobedience. ""If you should be righteous"" obedient to Allah ""then indeed He is ever, to those who turn [to Him]"" those who return to His obedience ""Forgiving"" for what they did against their parents. An initiative and they do not intend disobedience

“And give” give “the relative” the kin “his right” of kindness and kinship “and the needy and the traveler and do not spend wastefully” by spending in disobedience to Allah

“Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils” that is, in their way “and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful” extremely ungrateful for His blessings, so is his brother the wasteful

“But if you turn away from them” that is, the mentioned relatives and those after them and do not give them “seek mercy from your Lord which you hope for” that is, to ask for a provision that you expect to come to you and give them from it “speak to them a gentle word” soft and easy by promising them to give when the provision comes

“And do not make your hand chained to your neck” that is, do not withhold it from spending completely “nor extend it” in spending “to its full extent, lest you sit blamed” refers to the first “and deprived” cut off with nothing with you refers to the second

“Indeed, your Lord expands provision” expands it “for whomever He wills and restricts” restricts it for whomever He wills “He is ever, of His servants, All-Knowing, All-Seeing.” He knows their inner and outer selves, and provides for them according to their interests."

""And do not walk upon the earth exultantly."" That is, exultantly with arrogance and conceit.

The meaning is that you will not reach this level, so how can you be arrogant? ""All that"" mentioned ""is its evil in the sight of your Lord hateful."" ""That is from what has been revealed to you,"" O Muhammad, ""of your Lord of wisdom,"" the admonition. ""And do not set up with God another god, lest you be thrown into Hell, blamed and banished.""

""He is Forbearing, Forgiving"", since He did not hasten you. By punishment"
j-0575	“And when you recite the Qur’an, We place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter an invisible veil.” That is, a veil for you from them so that they do not see you. It was revealed about the one who wanted to kill him, may God bless him and grant him peace. “And We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness, so that they do not hear it. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Qur’an, they turn their backs in aversion. We know best what they listen to, because of it, in mockery, when they listen to you, your recitation. And when they are in private conversation, conversing among themselves, that is, talking, “When” instead of “when” before it, “the wrongdoers say, in their private conversation, “You follow none but a man bewitched,” deceived and overcome by his mind. God Almighty said, “See how they strike for you examples,” with the bewitched, the soothsayer, and the poet. “They have gone astray,” with that from guidance, “and are unable to find a way,” a path to it, “and they say,” denying the resurrection.
j-0576	“When we are bones and dust, shall we indeed be resurrected as a new creation?” “Say” to them, “Be stones or iron” “or a creation of that which is too great in your breasts” too great to accept life, let alone bones and dust, so the soul must be created within you. “Then they will say, ‘Who will restore us’” to life? “Say, ‘He who created you’” created you “the first time’” and you were nothing because the One who is able to begin is able to restore, rather it is easier. “Then they will shake their heads towards you” in amazement “and say” in mockery “When is it” meaning the resurrection? “Say, ‘Perhaps it will be near’” “The Day He will call you” calling you from the graves through the tongue of Israfil “and you will respond” so you will answer his call from the graves “with His praise” with His command, and it was said, “And to Him be praise” “and you will think that” you have not “stayed” in this world “except a little” because of the horror of what you see.
j-0577	"""And tell My servants"" the believers ""to say"" to the disbelievers the word ""that is best. Indeed, Satan induces"" corruption ""among them. Indeed, Satan has been to man a clear enemy"" between enmity and the word that is best is
""Your Lord is most knowing of you. If He wills, He will have mercy upon you"" through repentance and belief ""or if He wills"" to punish you, ""He will punish you"" by killing you in disbelief ""And We have not sent you over them as a guardian"" to force them to believe, and this is before the command to fight
""And your Lord is most knowing of those in the heavens and the earth"" so He singles them out as He wills according to their circumstances ""And We have certainly preferred some of the prophets over others"" by singling out each of them with a virtue like Moses with speech, Abraham with friendship, and Muhammad with the Night Journey ""and We gave David the Psalms""
""Say"" to them ""Call upon those you claim"" that they are gods ""besides Him"" ​​like the angels, Jesus and Ezra ""and they do not have the power to remove harm from you or to transfer it"" to someone else"
j-0578	"“Those whom they call upon” they are gods “seek” they ask “to their Lord the means” the closeness through obedience “which of them” instead of the waw they seek, meaning he seeks it who is “nearest” to Him, so how about others “and they hope for His mercy and fear His punishment” like others, so how do you call them gods “the punishment of your Lord is ever feared”

“And there is no town” meaning its people “but We will destroy it before the Day of Resurrection” by death “or punish it with a severe punishment” by killing or other means “that is in the Book” the Preserved Tablet “inscribed” written"
j-0579	"“And nothing prevented Us from sending the signs” which the people of Mecca proposed “except that the former peoples denied them” when We sent them and destroyed them. If We had sent them to these people, they would have denied them and urged destruction. We had decreed that they should be given respite to complete the command of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace. “And We gave Thamud the she-camel” that is, “a visible sign” clear and evident “but they wronged” they disbelieved “in it” and were destroyed. “And We do not send the signs” the miracles “except as a warning” to the servants so that they would believe. “And” remember “when We said to you, ‘Indeed, your Lord encompasses mankind’” in knowledge and power, so they are in His grasp, so convey it to them and do not fear anyone, for He will protect you from them. “And We did not make the vision which We showed you” clearly on the night of the Isra’ “except as a trial for mankind” the people of Mecca when they denied it and some of them turned back when He told them about it. “And the accursed tree in the Qur’an” is the Zaqqum that grows at the bottom of Hell. We made it a trial for them when they said, “Fire burns trees, so how can it grow them?” “And We warn them” with it. ""But what increases them"" our fear ""is nothing but great transgression"""
j-0580	“And” remember “when We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate to Adam,’” a prostration of greeting by bowing, “and they prostrated, except for Iblis. He said, ‘Shall I prostrate to one whom You created from clay?’” The accusative case is by removing the preposition, meaning from clay. He said, “Have you seen, that is, tell me, this one whom You have honored and favored over me by commanding me to prostrate to him, while I am better than him? You created me from fire. If I do not respite my oath until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely exterminate his descendants by seduction, except for a few of them whom I have protected.” “He” the Most High said to him, “Go,” giving him a respite until the time of the first blast, “and whoever follows you among them, indeed, Hell is your recompense,” you and them, “an ample recompense,” abundant and complete. “And incite,” belittle, “whoever you can among them with your voice,” with your call through singing and flutes and every caller to disobedience, “and bring upon them your cavalry and infantry,” meaning the riders and pedestrians in disobedience, “and share with them in the wealth,” the forbidden like usury and usurpation, “and the children,” from fornication. “He promised them” that there would be no resurrection or reward. “And Satan promises them nothing” of that “except delusion” falsely. “Indeed, My servants” the believers “you have no authority over them” authority and power. “And sufficient is your Lord as Disposer of affairs” as their protector from you.
j-0581	“Your Lord is He who drives the ships for you in the sea that you may seek of His bounty” the Most High, by means of trade. “Indeed, He is to you Merciful” in making it subservient to you. “And when distress” hardship “touches you at sea” the fear of drowning “those you call upon” you worship from among the gods, so you do not call upon Him “except Him” the Most High, for you call upon Him alone because you are in a hardship that only He can remove. “But when He has delivered you” from drowning and brought you “to the land, you turned away” from monotheism “and man is ungrateful” in denying blessings. “Have you then felt secure that He will not cause a part of the land to swallow you up” that is, the earth, “or that He will not send upon you a storm of stones” that is, that He will pelt you with pebbles, like the people of Lot “and then you will not find for yourself a protector” a guardian from Him. “Or have you felt secure that We will not return you into it” that is, the sea “another time” “and send upon you a violent wind” that is, a strong wind that does not pass by anything without striking it and breaking your ships “and drowning you with that which you have been given?” You have disbelieved, with your disbelief, and then you will not find for yourself against Us a follower or supporter who demands from Us what We did to you. And We have certainly honored, favored, the children of Adam, with knowledge, speech, and moderation of character, and other things, including their purity after death, and We have carried them on land and sea, on animals, and have provided for them of the good things and have preferred them over many of those We have created, such as the animals and wild beasts, with a marked preference. So “from” means “what” or according to its root, and it includes the angels. What is meant is the preference of the species, and it is not necessary to prefer its individuals, since they are better than humans other than the prophets.
j-0582	"Remember, “On the Day when We will call every people with their leader,” their prophet, and it will be said, “O nation of so-and-so,” or with their book of deeds, and it will be said, “O owner of evil,” and that is the Day of Resurrection. “Then whoever is given his book in his right hand,” and they are the happy ones who have insight in this world, “they will read their book and they will not be wronged,” they will not have their deeds reduced “a thread,” the size of a date pit’s shell. “And whoever is blind in this,” that is, this world, to the truth, “will be blind in the Hereafter,” to the path of salvation and reading the Qur’an, “and further astray from the path,” the furthest path from it. It was revealed about Thaqeef, and they asked the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, to make their valley sacred and they insisted on it. “And indeed,” lightened, “they were close,” “to tempt you,” to bring you down “from that which We have revealed to you, so that you would invent something else about Us.” And if,” had you done that, “they would have taken you as a friend.” “And had We not strengthened you,” on the truth by infallibility, “you would have almost,” “inclined,” “to incline toward them a little,” inclined, “a little.” Because of their great deceit and insistence, and it is clear that he, may God bless him and grant him peace, did not lean or come close. “If” if you had leaned, “We would have made you taste double” the torment “of life and double” the torment “of death” i.e. double what others are tormented with in this world and the next. “Then you will not find for yourself against Us a helper” to prevent it.

It was revealed when the Jews said to him, “If you are a prophet, then go to Ash-Sham, for it is the land of the prophets. “And if” lightened, “they almost provoked you from the land” the land of Medina “to expel you from it. And if” if they expel you “they will not remain behind you” in it “except for a little” then they will perish. “The way of those We sent before you of Our messengers” i.e. like Our way with them of destroying those who expelled them. “And you will not find in Our way any change” a change."
j-0583	"“Establish prayer from the sun’s decline” that is, from the time of its decline “until the darkness of the night” the approach of its darkness, that is, the noon, afternoon, sunset, and evening “and the Qur’an of dawn” the morning prayer “for the Qur’an of dawn is witnessed” witnessed by the angels of the night and the angels of the day

“And during part of the night, pray” a prayer “with it” the Qur’an “as an additional prayer for you” an additional obligation for you without your nation or as an advantage over the obligatory prayers “perhaps your Lord will raise you” will establish you “in the Hereafter to a praised station” in which the first and the last will praise you, and it is the station of intercession in the judgment of the judgement and was revealed when he commanded migration

“And say, ‘My Lord, admit me’” Medina “with an entrance of truth” an entrance that is pleasing in which I do not see what I dislike “and bring me out’” from Mecca “with an exit of truth” an exit to which I do not turn my heart “and grant me from Yourself a supporting authority” a power with which You will grant me victory over Your enemies

And say when you enter Mecca, “The truth of Islam has come and falsehood has vanished, disbelief has vanished. Falsehood is bound to vanish.” It was fading and disappearing. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, entered it and around the Kaaba there were three hundred and sixty idols. He kept stabbing them with a stick in his hand and saying that until they fell. Narrated by the two sheikhs. “And We send down from the Qur’an that which is a healing and a mercy for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.”"
j-0584	"""And when We bestow favor upon man,"" the disbeliever, ""he turns away,"" from gratitude, ""and distances himself,"" he bends his back, haughtily, ""and when evil touches him,"" poverty and hardship, ""he is despairing,"" despairing of God's mercy. ""Say, 'Each one of us and you acts according to his own nature,' his way, ""but your Lord knows best who is best guided in way,"" way, so He will reward him. ""And they ask you,"" that is, the Jews, ""about the spirit,"" by which the body lives. ""Say,"" to them, ""The spirit is from the command of my Lord,"" that is, His knowledge, which you do not know, ""and of knowledge you have not been given except a little,"" in comparison to His knowledge, the Most High. ""And if,"" the lam of an oath, ""We willed, We could surely take away that which We have revealed to you,"" that is, the Qur'an, by erasing it from the hearts and copies of the Qur'an, ""then you would not find for it against Us any protector,"" ""except,"" but We preserved it, ""as a mercy from your Lord. Indeed, His favor upon you has ever been great,"" great, since He sent it down to you and granted you the praised station and other virtues."
j-0585	"Say, ""If mankind and the jinn gathered together to produce the like of this Qur'an in eloquence and rhetoric, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other helpful backers."" This was revealed in response to their statement. And if We willed, We could have said the like of this. ""And We have certainly diversified for the people in this Qur'an from every [kind of] example,"" an attribute of something omitted, i.e. an example from the same type as every example, so that they may be admonished. ""But most of the people,"" i.e. the people of Mecca, ""refused except disbelief,"" denying the truth."
j-0586	"""And they said,"" referring to Abu, ""We will not believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth,"" a spring from which water springs. ""Or you have a garden,"" an orchard, ""of palm trees and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth within it,"" in its midst, ""abundantly."" ""Or you cause the sky to fall upon us in fragments, as you have claimed,"" in definiteness, ""Or you bring God and the angels as a face,"" in direct confrontation and with sight, so that we see them. ""Or you have a house of gold,"" gold, ""Or you ascend,"" ascend, ""into the heaven,"" by a ladder, ""And we will not believe in your ascension,"" if you ascend in it, ""Until you bring down to us,"" from it, ""a book,"" in which there is confirmation of your truth, ""that we may read."" Say, to them, ""Glory be to my Lord,"" in amazement. ""Are you anything but a human messenger?"" like all the other messengers? They did not bring a sign except by God's permission. ""And nothing prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said,"" that is, their saying in denial, ""Has God sent a human messenger?"" And He did not send an angel. ""Say, to them, ""If there were on the earth,"" instead of humans, ""angels,"" They walk in peace of mind. We have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a messenger. No messenger is sent to a people except from their own kind, so that they can address him and understand him. Say, “Sufficient is God as a witness between me and you. Indeed, He is ever, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing.” Knowing of their inner and outer selves."
j-0587	“And he whom Allah guides, he is the one who is guided, and he whom He sends astray - you will not find for them protectors other than Him. And We will gather them on the Day of Resurrection, walking, blind, dumb and deaf. Their refuge is Hell. Whenever it subsides, We will increase their blazing fire.” “That is their recompense because they disbelieved in Our signs and said, denying the resurrection, “When we are bones and dust, will we indeed be resurrected as a new creation?” “Have they not seen that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, despite their greatness, is able to create the likes of them, that is, people in their youth, and has appointed for them a term, of death and resurrection, about which there is no doubt? But the wrongdoers refuse except disbelief, denying Him.” “Say, ‘If you possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord,’ of provision and rain, ‘then you would withhold them,’ for fear of spending, for fear of running out of them by spending, and you would be stingy. And man is ever niggardly.”
j-0588	“And We gave Moses nine clear signs” - the hand, the staff, the flood, the locusts, the lice, the frogs, the blood or the obliteration and the reduction of fruits. “So ask” O Muhammad “the Children of Israel” about him, a question to confirm to the polytheists your truthfulness, or We said to him, “Ask.” In a reading with the past tense, “When he came to them, Pharaoh said to him, “Indeed, I think, O Moses, that you are bewitched.” Deceived and overcome by your mind. “He said, “Indeed, you know that none has sent down these” - the signs “except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as insights.” As a lesson, but you are stubborn. In a reading with the damma on the ta’, “And indeed, I think, O Pharaoh, that you are doomed” - perishing or diverted from good. “So” - Pharaoh “intended to provoke them” - to expel Moses and his people “from the land” - the land of Egypt. “So We drowned him and all those with him, all together.” “And We said after him to the Children of Israel, ‘Dwell in the land. And when the promise of the Hereafter comes’ - that is, the Hour - “We will bring you all together” - all of you and them.
j-0589	""And with the truth We have sent it down" that is, the Qur'an "and with the truth" that it contains "it has come down" as it was sent down, without any change. "And We have not sent you" O Muhammad "except as a bringer of good tidings" to those who believe in Paradise "and a warner" to those who disbelieve in Hell. "And a Qur'an" is in the accusative case with a verb that explains it. "We have divided it" We sent it down in parts over twenty or three years "that you may recite it to the people at intervals" slowly and deliberately so that they may understand it. "And We have sent it down gradually" little by little according to interests. "Say" to the disbelievers of Mecca "Believe in it or do not believe" as a threat to them. "Indeed, those who were given knowledge before it" before its revelation, and they are the believers of the People of the Book, "when it is recited to them, they fall upon their faces in prostration" "and they say, 'Glory be to our Lord'" purifying Him from breaking His promise. "Indeed" is a lightened "the promise of our Lord" in its revelation and sending the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, "has been fulfilled." "And they fall upon their faces weeping" is a conjunction with an additional description. "And it increases them" the Qur'an "in humility." In humility to Allah
And he, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, used to say, “O Allah, O Most Gracious.” They said, “He forbids us to worship two gods, while he is calling upon another god with Him.” So it was revealed, “Say to them, call upon Allah or call upon the Most Gracious,” meaning, name Him by whichever of them you call upon, or call upon Him by saying, “O Allah, O Most Gracious.” Whichever of these two you call upon, it is good. It indicates this, so He, that is, the one who named them, has the best names, and these two are among them, as in the hadith, “Allah, there is no god but Him, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the King, the Holy, the Peace, the Faithful, the Guardian, the Preserver, the Mighty, the Compeller, the Proud, the Creator, the Maker, the Fashioner, the Forgiver, the Subduer, the Giver, the Provider, the Opener, the Knowing, the Restrictor, the Expander, the Abaser, the Exalter, the Honorer, the Humiliator, the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing, the Just, the Kind, the All-Knowing, the Forbearing, the Great, the Forgiving, the Grateful, the High, the Great, the Preserver, the Honorable, the Reckoner, the Majestic, the Generous, the Watchful, the Responder, the Vast, the Wise, the Loving, the Majestic, the Resurrector, the Witness, the Truth, the Trustee, the Strong, the Firm, the Guardian, the Praiseworthy, the Enumerator, the Initiator, the Restorer, the Giver of Life, the Giver of Death, the Living, the Self-Sustaining, the Finder, the Majestic, the One, the Unique, the Eternal, the Able, the Powerful, the Forerunner, the Delayer, the First, the Last, the Manifest, the Hidden, the Guardian, the Exalted, the Righteous The Forgiving, the Avenger, the Pardoner, the Compassionate, the Owner of the Kingdom, the Possessor of Majesty and Honor, the Just, the Gatherer, the Rich, the Enricher, the Preventer, the Harmful, the Beneficial, the Light, the Guide, the Incomparable, the Eternal, the Inheritor, the Rightly Guided, the Patient. Narrated by Al-Tirmidhi: “And do not recite your prayer aloud, lest the polytheists hear you, and revile the Qur’an and the One Who revealed it. And do not recite it in a low voice, in a low voice, so that your companions may benefit. And seek, I mean, “between that,” between the loud voice and the low voice, “a path,” a middle path. “A partner in the Kingdom,” in divinity. “And He has no protector,” to support Him, “out of” “humiliation,” that is, He has not been humiliated so that he would need a supporter. “And glorify Him with a complete glorification,” glorify Him with a greatness that is perfect in taking a son, a partner, humiliation, and everything that is not befitting of Him. And the order of praise is based on that to indicate that He is the One deserving of all praise due to the perfection of His Self and His uniqueness in His attributes. Imam Ahmad narrated in his Musnad on the authority of Mu’adh Al-Juhani on the authority of the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, that he used to say: The verse of glory: Praise be to God, who has not taken a son, and has no partner in The King to the end of the Surah and God Almighty knows best. Its author said: This is the last thing I have completed with the interpretation of the Noble Qur’an, which was composed by the Sheikh, the Imam, the scholar, the researcher, Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli al-Shafi’i, may God be pleased with him. I have emptied it for the completion and upon it in the ambiguous verses is reliance and dependence. May God have mercy on the one who looks at it with an eye of fairness and finds an error in it and informs me of it. I have said: I have praised God, my Lord, for He has guided me to what I have expressed despite my inability and weakness. So who can I find a mistake to refute and who can accept it even with a letter? It never occurred to me to expose myself to that because I know of my inability to delve into these paths. May God benefit greatly from it and open with it covered hearts and deaf eyes and ears. It is as if I am one who is accustomed to lengthy verses and has turned away from this completion and its origin in order to be decisive and has turned to explicit stubbornness and has not directed understanding to its subtleties. “And whoever is blind in this will be blind in the Hereafter.” May God grant us through it guidance to the path of truth and success and insight into the subtleties of His words and verification and make us through it “with those upon whom God has bestowed favor from among the prophets.” And the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous, and what excellent companions they are! He finished composing it on Sunday, the tenth of Shawwal in the year eight hundred and seventy, and it began on Wednesday, the beginning of Ramadan of the aforementioned year, and he finished whitening it on Wednesday, the sixth of Safar in the year eight hundred and seventy-one, and God knows best. Sheikh Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr al-Khatib al-Tawkhi said: My friend, the eminent Sheikh Kamal al-Din al-Mahalli, the brother of our Sheikh, Sheikh Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli, may God Almighty have mercy on them both, told me that he saw his brother, the aforementioned Sheikh Jalal al-Din, in a dream, and in front of him was our friend, the eminent scholar, the investigator Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, the author of this supplement. The Sheikh took this supplement in his hand and looked through it, and said to its aforementioned author, “Which is better, my composition or your composition?” He said, “My composition.” He said, “Look,” and he presented to him places in it, as if he was pointing to an objection in it gently, and the author of this supplement, whenever something was brought to him, he would answer it, and the Sheikh would smile and laugh. Our Sheikh, the imam, the eminent scholar Jalal al-Din Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr al-Suyuti, the author of this supplement, said: “I believe and am certain that the composition that Sheikh Jalal al-Din al-Mahalli, may God Almighty have mercy on him, composed in his piece is better than my composition by many levels.” How and most of what I have put here is quoted from his position and benefited from him, I have no doubt about that. As for what was seen in the dream written above, perhaps the Sheikh referred to the few places in which it differed from his position for a point and it is very few, I do not think it reaches ten places, including that the Sheikh said in Surat Sad and the soul is a subtle body by which man lives through its influence in him, and I followed him first and mentioned this limit in Surat Al-Hijr, then I struck on it for the saying of the Most High: “And they ask you about the soul. Say: The soul is from the command of my Lord” (Al-Hijr), the verse is explicit or almost explicit that the soul is from the knowledge of God Almighty, we do not know it, so refraining from defining it is better. Therefore, Sheikh Taj Al-Din Ibn Al-Subki said in Jami’ Al-Jawami’ and the soul was not spoken about by Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, so we refrain from it. Among them is that the Sheikh said in Surat Al-Hajj, the Sabians are a group of Jews, so I mentioned that in Surat Al-Baqarah and added or the Christians as an explanation of a second statement, for it is well-known, especially among our jurists, and in Al-Minhaaj, even though the Samaria differed from the Jews and the Sabians from the Christians in the origin of their religion, and in his explanation that Al-Shafi’i May God be pleased with him, he stated that the Sabians are a sect of Christians, and I cannot recall a third place now, so it is as if the Sheikh, may God Almighty have mercy on him, is referring to something like this, and God knows best what is correct, and to Him is the reference and the destination.

j-0590	"""Praise"", which is the description of the beautiful, is established ""for God"" the Most High.

j-0591	“Indeed, We have made what is on the earth” of animals, plants, trees, rivers, and other things “an adornment for it that We may test them” to test people by looking at that “which of them is best in deed” in it, that is, most uninterested in it. “And indeed, We will make what is on it [as] a barren ground” crumbs “without growth.”
j-0592	"«Or did you think» that is, did you think «that the People of the Cave» the cave in the mountain «and the Inscription» the tablet on which their names and lineages were written? The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, was asked about their story «were» in their story «among» the whole «of Our signs a wonder» the predicate of «was» and what preceded it is a state, meaning they were a wonder unlike the rest of the signs or the most wonderful of them. This is not the case.

Remember «when the youths took refuge in the cave» the plural of youth, which is a complete young man, fearing for their faith from their disbelieving people «and they said, ""Our Lord, grant us from Yourself"" from before You «mercy and prepare» improve «for us in our affair right guidance» guidance.

«So We sealed their ears» that is, We put them to sleep «in the cave for a number of years» a numbered amount.

«Then We raised them» We woke them up «that We might know» the knowledge of seeing «which of the two parties» the two groups differing in the length of their stay «had best counted» the verb meaning more accurately «how long they had stayed» their stay is related to what follows it «a period» a limit.

«We relate» we recite ""Upon you, inform them in truth"" with honesty ""they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance."" ""And We strengthened their hearts"" We strengthened them to speak the truth ""when they stood up"" before their King, who had ordered them to prostrate to idols ""and said, 'Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth.

If we called upon any god other than God, it would be obligatory. ""These"" is the subject of ""our people"" an explanatory apposition ""have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not bring upon them"" regarding their worship ""a clear authority"" with a clear argument ""then who is more unjust"" that is, no one is more unjust ""than he who invents a lie against God"" by attributing a partner to Him, the Most High? Some of the youths said to others ""And when you have withdrawn from them and what they worship except God, then take refuge in the cave. Your Lord will spread out for you from His mercy and will prepare for you from your affair ease"" with a kasra on the m and a fatha on the f and vice versa what you will find comfort with from Lunch and dinner"
j-0593	"""And you will see the sun, when it rises, inclining away from their cave on the right,"" with emphasis and without emphasis, ""and when it sets, it passes them by on the left,"" leaving them and passing by them so that they will never be affected, ""while they are in an open space thereof,"" a wide area of ​​the cave where the coolness of the wind and its breeze reach them. ""That,"" mentioned, ""is among the signs of Allah,"" evidence of His power. ""He whom Allah guides is the one who is guided, and he whom He sends astray, you will never find for him a protector to guide him."" ""And you will think them,"" if you saw them, ""awake,"" that is, alert because their eyes are open, the plural of yaqiz, with a kasra on the qaf, ""while they are asleep,"" sleeping, the plural of raqid. ""And We turn them to the right and to the left,"" so that the earth does not consume their flesh, ""and their dog is stretching out his forelegs,"" his hands, ""at the entrance,"" in the courtyard of the cave. And when they turned, he turned like them in sleep and wakefulness. ""If you had looked at them, you would have turned away from them in flight, and you would have been filled,"" with emphasis and without emphasis, ""with terror from them,"" with a sukoon on the 'ayn and a damma on it. Allah prevented them with terror from anyone entering upon them. “And thus,” as We did to them what We mentioned, “We sent them up,” We awakened them, “that they might ask one another,” about their condition and the length of their stay. “One of them said, ‘How long have you stayed?’ They said, ‘We stayed a day or part of a day,’” because they entered the cave at sunrise and were sent at sunset, so they thought that it was sunset on the day of entry. Then “they said,” hesitating about that, “Your Lord knows best how long you stayed. So send one of you with your silver,’ with the sukoon on the ra’ ​​and the kasra on the ra’, “to the city,” it is said that it is now called Tarsus with the fatha on the ra’, “and let him see which of them has the best food,” that is, which of the city’s foods is the most permissible, “and let him bring you provision from it and be gentle, and let no one know about you.” “If they gain victory over you, they will stone you,” they will kill you by stoning, “or return you to their religion. And you will never succeed then,” that is, if you return to their religion, “ever.”"
j-0594	“And thus,” just as We sent them, “We made known” We informed “them” their people and the believers “that they might know” that is, their people “that the promise of God” of resurrection “is true” by way of the fact that He who is able to put them to sleep for a long time and keep them in their condition without food is able to revive the dead “and that there is no doubt” there is no doubt “about the Hour, when” the object of “We made known” “they disputed” that is, the believers and the disbelievers “among themselves their affair” the affair of the young men to build around them “and they said” that is, the disbelievers “build over them” that is, around them “a structure” that would conceal them “their Lord knows best about them.” Those who prevailed in their affair said “we will surely build over them” around them “a mosque” in which to pray, and he did that at the entrance to the cave “they will say” that is, those disputing about the number of the young men in the time of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, that is, some of them say they are “three, their dog being the fourth, and they say” that is, some of them “five, their dog being the sixth” and the two statements are for the Christians of Najran “guessing at the unseen.” Any assumption in their absence, and it refers to both statements together, and its accusative is on the object for it, meaning for their assumption of that, “And they say,” meaning the believers, “Seven, and the eighth of them is their dog,” the sentence of the subject and its predicate is an attribute of seven with the addition of the waw, and it was said to emphasize or indicate the attachment of the attribute to the described, and the description of the first ones with stoning without the third is evidence that it is acceptable and correct, “Say, ‘My Lord knows best their number. None knows them except a few,’” Ibn Abbas said, “I am one of the few,” and he mentioned them as seven, “So do not dispute,” argue, “about them except with an outward dispute,” with what was revealed to you, “and do not ask a fatwa about them,” seek a fatwa, “from them,” from the People of the Book, the Jews, “anyone,” and the people of Mecca asked him about the story of the People of the Cave, so he said, “I will tell you about it tomorrow,” and he did not say, “God willing,” so it was revealed.
j-0595	“And never say of anything, ‘I will do that tomorrow,’” meaning, in the future, “except if God wills,” meaning, except when mixed with the will of God Almighty, by saying, “God willing.” “And remember your Lord,” meaning His will, depending on it, “if you forget.” And remembering it after forgetting is like remembering it with good speech and other things as long as one is in the assembly. “And say, ‘Perhaps my Lord will guide me to something nearer than this,’” from the story of the People of the Cave in indicating my prophethood, “to right guidance.” And God did that.
j-0596	"""And they remained in their cave for three hundred years"" with the tanween ""years"" is an explanatory apposition for three hundred. These three hundred years according to the People of the Cave are solar years, and the lunar years are nine years more than them according to the Arabs. This was mentioned in His statement, ""And they added nine"" meaning nine years, so the three hundred solar years are three hundred and nine lunar years. ""Say, 'Allah knows best how long they remained'"" of those about whom they differed, which is what was mentioned previously. ""To Him belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth"" meaning His knowledge. ""He sees it"" meaning of Allah, it is a form of astonishment. ""And He hears"" of it likewise, meaning what I see and what I hear, and they are both metaphorical. What is meant is that nothing is hidden from His sight and hearing. ""They"" for the people of the heavens and the earth ""have no protector"" helper ""nor does He share in His rule anyone"" because He is independent of a partner."
j-0597	And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no changing His words, and you will not find any refuge other than Him. And keep yourself patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, desiring His countenance, not worldly pleasures. And do not turn your eyes away from them, desiring adornments of worldly life, and do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, meaning the Qur’an, namely ‘Uyaynah ibn Hisn and his companions, and follow his own desire, in polytheism, and his affair is ever [in] excess.
j-0598	"«And say» to him and his companions, this is the Qur’an «The truth is from your Lord, so whoever wills - let him believe, and whoever wills - let him disbelieve» a threat to them «Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers» that is, the disbelievers «a Fire whose walls will encompass them» that which surrounds it «And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil» like cloudy oil «that will scald the faces» from its heat when brought near to it «An evil drink» that is, the Fire «and an evil resting place» a specification transferred from the subject, that is, an ugly resting place, and it is opposite to what He says later in Paradise «and an excellent resting place» otherwise what resting place is in the Fire «Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds - never will We allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds» the clause is the predicate of «Indeed, those» and in it the apparent is used in place of the implied, and the meaning is their reward, that is, We will reward them for what it includes
Those will have Gardens of Eden, a residence beneath which rivers flow, they will be adorned therein with bracelets, it is said that «from» is redundant, and it is said that it is for partiality, and it is the plural of «aswarah» like «ahmarah» is the plural of «swarah» of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine silk Of brocade and heavy brocade, that which is coarse therein. And in the verse of the Most Gracious: Its linings are of heavy brocade, reclining therein on couches. Plural of couch, which is the bed in the chamber, which is a house decorated with clothes and curtains for the bride. What an excellent reward, recompense! Paradise, and a good resting place."
j-0599	"“And strike” make “for them” for the unbelievers with the believers “an example: two men” a substitute, and what follows is an explanation of the example “We made for one of them” the unbeliever “two gardens” two orchards “of grapevines and surrounded them with palm trees and placed between them crops” by which he could live
“Both gardens” both singular indicating dual subject “produced” its predicate “its fruit” its fruit “and did not wrong” decrease “anything thereof” “and We caused a river to gush forth” between them “and he had” with the two gardens “fruit” with the opening of the tha’ and the meem and with the damma of both and with the damma of the first and the sukoon of the second, which is the plural of fruit like tree and shrub and wood and wood and body and body “and he said to his companion” the believer “while he was conversing with him” boasting to him “I am more wealthy than you and stronger in men” clan
“and he entered his garden” with his companion, walking around in it and showing him its fruits and he did not say “his two gardens” meaning the garden and it was said that the singular was sufficient “and he was unjust” To himself"" by disbelief ""He said, I do not think that this will ever perish"" 
""And I do not think that the Hour will come, and if I am returned to my Lord"" in the Hereafter, according to your claim ""I will surely find better than it as a return"" returning
""His companion said to him while he was conversing with him"" answering him ""Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust"" because Adam was created from it ""Then made you speak"" from me ""Then proportioned you"" He adjusted you and made you ""a man""
""But we"" is its original but I transferred the movement of the hamza to the nun or deleted the hamza and then assimilated the nun into its like ""He"" is the pronoun of the matter explained by the sentence after it and the meaning is I say ""God is my Lord and I do not associate anyone with my Lord""
And had it not been that when you entered your garden you said in your admiration of it, this is what God willed, there is no power except with God and in the hadith whoever is given goodness of people or wealth and says at that time what God willed, there is no power except with God, he will not see any harm in it if you see me a pronoun separating the two objects less than you in wealth and children
""Then perhaps my Lord will ""He will be given better than your garden"" is the answer to the condition ""and He will send upon it a reckoning"" plural of ""hisbanah"" meaning thunderbolts ""from the sky so that it becomes a slippery ground"" smooth ground on which no foot can stand
""or its water becomes sunken"" meaning sunken, in apposition to ""sends"" without ""becomes"" because the sinking of water is not caused by thunderbolts ""then you will not be able to pursue it"" a trick by which you can catch it
""and its fruit will be encompassed"" with the previous aspects of control with his garden by destruction so it perished ""so he began to wring his hands"" in regret and remorse ""over what he spent on it"" in the construction of his garden ""while it was empty"" fallen ""on its thrones"" its supports for the vineyard because it fell and then the vineyard fell ""and he will say, ""Oh"" for emphasis ""I wish I had not associated anyone with my Lord""
""and there was not"" with the ta and the ya ""for him a group"" to aid him other than Allah"" when it perished ""nor could he be victorious"" from its perishing by himself
""there"" meaning on the Day of Resurrection ""the guardianship"" with the opening of the waw means victory and with the breaking of it means kingship “Allah has the right” in the nominative, the attribute of guardianship, and in the adjective, the attribute of majesty. “He is better in reward” than the reward of someone else, if he were to reward. “And better in consequence” by adding the qāf and its sukūn as a consequence for the believers, and putting them in the accusative of distinction."
j-0600	"""And strike for them"" make ""for your people"" ""the similitude of the life of this world"" first object ""like water"" second object ""which We sent down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingled with it"" thickened due to the water falling, ""and became"" the vegetation became ""stubble"" dry and its parts scattered ""which the winds scatter"" and disperse it ""and carry it away"" meaning he likened this world to beautiful vegetation that dried up and broke and the winds scattered it, and in the reading of the wind ""and God is over all things competent"" able ""Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world"" with which He beautifies Himself in it ""and the lasting good deeds"" are Subhan Allah, Al-Hamdulillah, La Ilaha Illa Allah, Allahu Akbar, some of them added, La Hawla Wa La Quwwata Illa Billah ""are better in the sight of your Lord for reward and better in hope"" meaning what a person hopes for and expects from God Almighty"
j-0601	“And” mention “the Day when the mountains will move” We will remove them from the face of the earth and they will become scattered dust. In another reading, with the letter “nun” and the letter “ya” broken and the letters “mountains” in the accusative case. “And you will see the earth exposed” visible, with nothing on it of mountains or anything else. “And We will gather them” the believers and the disbelievers “and We will not leave out” we will leave “one of them.” “And they will be presented before your Lord in ranks” a state, meaning, each nation in a row, and it will be said to them, “You have certainly come to Us as We created you the first time” meaning, individually, barefoot, naked, and uncircumcised. And it will be said to those who deny the resurrection, “Rather, you claimed that” “an” is a lightened version of the heavy one, meaning that “We will not make for you an appointment” for the resurrection. “And the Book will be placed” the book of every person in his right hand from the believers and in his left from the disbelievers “and you will see the criminals” the disbelievers “fearful” afraid “of what is in it and they will say” when they see what is in it of evils “Oh” for emphasis “Woe to us” our destruction, and it is a source that has no action from its wording “What is this Book that does not leave out anything small or great” from Our sins “except that He has counted them” He counted them and recorded them. They were amazed at Him for that. “And they will find what they did present” recorded in their book. “And your Lord does not wrong anyone” He does not punish him without a crime and does not diminish the reward of a believer.
j-0602	“And when” is in the accusative case of “remember” “We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate to Adam’” a prostration of bowing, not placing the forehead in greeting him “so they prostrated, except for Iblis. He was one of the jinn” It was said that they are a type of angels, so the exception is connected, and it was said that it is disconnected, and Iblis is the father of the jinn, so he has offspring who were mentioned with him later, and the angels do not have offspring “so he disobeyed the command of his Lord” that is, he went out of his obedience by not prostrating “Then will you take him and his offspring” the address is to Adam and his offspring, and the “ha” in both places is for Iblis “as allies instead of Me” you obey them “and they are your enemies” that is, enemies, a state “Evil is the substitute for the wrongdoers” Iblis and his offspring in their obedience instead of obeying God “I did not make them witness” that is, Iblis and his offspring “to the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor to the creation of themselves” that is, I did not witness some of them creating others “nor would I have taken the misguiders” the devils “as assistants” helpers in creation, so how can you obey them? “And on the Day” is in the accusative case of “remember” with the “ya” and the “nun” “Call upon My partners,” the idols, “whom you claimed,” so that they would intercede for you according to your claim, “but they called upon them, but they did not respond to them,” they did not respond to them, “and We placed between them,” between the idols and their worshippers, “a place of destruction,” a valley of the valleys of Hell in which they will all perish. It is from “wabaqa” with the fat-ha, “halaka” (destroyed). “And the criminals will see the Fire and they will think,” that is, they will be certain, “that they will fall into it,” that is, they will fall into it, “and they will find no way out from it,” a moderator.
j-0603	“And We have certainly presented in this Qur’an for the people from every [kind of] example” an attribute of something omitted, i.e. an example from the same type as every example so that they may be admonished. “But man” i.e. the disbelievers “is ever most disputatious of anything” quarreling over falsehood, which is a distinction transferred from the noun kan, meaning “and man’s disputation was most of anything in it.” “And nothing prevented the people” i.e. the disbelievers of Mecca “from believing” a second object “when guidance came to them” the Qur’an “and from asking forgiveness of their Lord except that the precedent of the former peoples should come upon them” subject i.e. Our precedent for them, which is the destruction decreed for them “or that the punishment should come upon them before” opposite to “and before” which is the killing on the Day of Badr. In a reading with two dammahs, the plural of “qabeel” i.e. types. “And We do not send the messengers except as bearers of good tidings to the believers and warners, frightening the disbelievers. And those who disbelieve argue with falsehood by saying, “Has Allah sent a human being as a messenger?” and the like, so that they may invalidate with their argument the truth of the Qur’an. And they have taken My verses, i.e. the Qur’an, and that with which they have been warned of the Fire, in mockery.”
j-0604	“And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the verses of his Lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth” what he did of disbelief and sins. “Indeed, We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it” that is, lest they understand the Qur’an, that is, so they do not understand it. “And in their ears deafness” a weight so they do not hear it. “And if you should invite them to guidance, they will never be guided” that is, by the aforementioned placement “ever.” “And your Lord is the Forgiving, the Possessor of Mercy. If He were to impose blame upon them” in this world “for what they have earned, He would have hastened for them the punishment” in it. “Rather, for them is an appointed time” which is the Day of Resurrection “from which they will not find a refuge” a shelter. “And those cities” that is, their people, such as ‘Aad and Thamud and others, “We destroyed them when they were unjust” they disbelieved. “And We appointed for their destruction” for their destruction. And in a reading with the opening of the m, meaning for their destruction, “an appointed time.”
j-0605	"“And” remember “when Moses” he is the son of Imran “said to his boy” Joshua bin Nun who was following him and serving him and taking knowledge from him “I will not stop” I will not stop traveling “until I reach the junction of the two seas” the meeting place of the Roman and Persian seas towards the east, that is, the place that brings them together “or I will spend ages” a long time in reaching it if it is far. “But when they reached the junction between them” between the two seas “they forgot their fish” Joshua forgot to carry him when departing and Moses forgot to remind him “so it took” the fish “its way in the sea” that is, he made it by God’s making “a gorge” that is, like a gorge, which is a long crack that cannot be penetrated, and that is because God Almighty held back the flow of water from the fish, so it withdrew from it and remained like a window that did not heal and what was beneath it of it froze. “So when they had passed” that place by walking until lunchtime on the second day “he” Moses “said to his boy, “We have certainly received our lunch” it is what is eaten at the beginning of the day “We have certainly suffered from this journey of ours” fatigue and its occurrence after passing. “He said Did you see, when we took refuge at the rock, in that place? I forgot the fish. None made me forget to mention it except Satan. He replaces the ha’ with “that I should mention it” as a substitute for inclusion, meaning he made me forget to mention it. “And the fish took its way in the sea, as a wonder.” Second object, meaning that Moses and his servant were amazed by it, as previously explained. “He said,” Moses, “That,” meaning that we lost the fish. “That is what we were seeking,” we were seeking, for it is a sign for us of the existence of the one we were seeking. “So they returned,” they went back, “on their tracks,” telling them stories. They came to the rock. They found a servant of Ours, al-Khidr. We had given him mercy from Us, prophethood in one opinion, and guardianship in another. Most scholars are of this opinion, and We taught him knowledge from Us before Us. Second object, meaning known from the unseen. Al-Bukhari narrated a hadith that Moses stood up to give a sermon to the Children of Israel, and he was asked who among the people was the most knowledgeable. He said, “I am.” So God rebuked him because he did not refer the knowledge to Him, so God revealed to him, “I have a servant at the junction of the two seas.” He knows better than you. Moses said, “O Lord, how can I deal with him?” He said, “Take a fish with you and put it in a basket. Wherever the fish is lost, it is there.” So he took a fish and put it in a basket, then he set out, and with him set out his servant Joshua bin Nun until they reached the rock and put their heads down and slept. The fish stirred in the basket, so it came out of it and fell into the sea. It took its way in the sea, a tunnel. God held back the flow of water from the fish, so it became like a ceiling over it. When he woke up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, so they set out for the rest of their day and night. When it was morning, Moses said to his servant, “Bring us our lunch,” until His saying, “And it took its way in the sea, a wonder.” He said, “And the fish had a tunnel, and Moses and his servant had a wonder,” etc.

“Moses said to him, ‘Shall I follow you, that you may teach me from what you have been taught, right guidance?’” That is, right guidance with which he was guided. In a reading with a damma on the ra’ ​​and a sukoon on the shin, and he asked him that because visiting in knowledge is required.

“He said, ‘Indeed, you will never be able to have patience with me.’”

And how can you have patience with what you do not have knowledge of? In the previous hadith following this verse, O Moses. I have knowledge from God that He taught me and you do not know it, and you have knowledge from God that God taught you and I do not know it. His statement is a source of information meaning you did not comprehend, i.e. you did not tell its truth.

He said, "You will find me, God willing, patient and not disobedient." That is, not disobedient. "You have a command." You command me with it, and he restricted it to the will because he was not confident in himself in what he committed to, and this is the habit of the prophets and saints, not to trust themselves for the blink of an eye.

He said, "If you follow me, do not ask me about anything." In a reading with the opening of the lam and the shaddah of the noon, "about anything" that you do not know about me in your knowledge, and be patient. "Until I mention it to you with its cause." That is, I mention it to you with its cause. So Moses accepted his condition, out of respect for the etiquette of the learner with the scholar.

"So they set out," walking on the sea, "until they embarked on the ship," that passed them by, "he tore it open," al-Khidr, by pulling out a plank or two from it from the direction of the sea with an axe when it reached the depths. "He said," to him, "Have you tore it open to drown its people?" In a reading with the opening of the taa and the raa and the raising of its people, "You have certainly done a terrible thing," that is, a great thing.


He said, "Did I not tell you that you would never be able to have patience with me?"

He said, "Do not hold me accountable for what I forgot." That is, I neglected to submit to you and not deny you. "And do not burden me with hardship in my affair." That is, treat me with forgiveness and ease.

"So they set out." After they left the ship, they walked. "Until they met a boy." He had not yet reached puberty, playing with the boys, the most handsome of them. "So he killed him." Al-Khidr slaughtered him with a knife while he was lying down, or he tore off his head with his hand, or he struck his head against the wall. Statements. Here, the letter fa' was used because killing follows the encounter and is the answer to if. "He said," to him, "Did you kill a pure soul?" That is, a pure soul that had not reached the age of accountability. In the reading, zakiyah, with a shaddah on the ya', without an alif. "Without a soul." That is, you did not kill a soul. "Indeed, you have done something monstrous." With a sukoon on the kaf and a damma on it, that is, monstrous.

"He said, "Did I not tell you that you would never be able to have patience with me?" He added to what came before it because there is no excuse here.

For this reason, “He said, ‘If I ask you about anything after this,’” meaning after this time, “do not accompany me,” do not let me follow you. “I have conveyed from Me,” with emphasis and with emphasis from Me, “an excuse” for your leaving me. “So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town,” that is, Antioch, “they asked its people for food,” they asked them for food as hospitality, “but they refused to host them. Then they found therein a wall,” one hundred cubits high, “about to collapse,” meaning about to fall because of its tilt, “so Al-Khidr straightened it with his hand. “He said,” to Moses, “If you had wished, you could have taken for it,” and in another reading, “you could have taken for it a fee,” they gave it to them, since they did not host us despite our need for food.

In a reading with the accusative of “reward” and its tanween, Al-Farra’ said: Its accusative is for explanation, meaning for the sake of the relation. “And We will say to him of Our command with ease” meaning We will command him with what is easy for him. “Then he followed a way” towards the east.
j-0608	"“Until, when he reached the rising place of the sun,” the place where it rises, “he found it rising on a people,” the Zanj, “for whom We had not made any covering” of clothing or roof because their land could not support a building and they had paths in which they would disappear at sunrise and appear at its height. “Thus,” that is, the matter is as we said, “and We have encompassed what he has,” that is, what Dhul-Qarnayn has of tools and soldiers and other things, “in knowledge.” “Then he followed a way.” “Until, when he reached between the two barriers,” with the opening of the seen and its closing here, and after them are two mountains at the end of the land of the Turks, Alexander blocked what was between them as will come, “he found before them,” that is, in front of them, “a people who could hardly understand a word,” that is, they could not understand it except after a delay. In another reading, with the dammah on the ya’ and the kasrah on the qaf, “they said, ‘O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog’” with the hamza or without it, they are two foreign names for two tribes and they were not declined “are corrupters in the land,” by plundering and transgressing when they came out to us. “So will you then…” ""We will make for you a tribute"" a tribute of money, and in another reading a tribute ""on condition that you make between us and them a barrier"" so that they cannot reach us. ""He said, 'Whatever I have established in it is better'"" and in another reading with two noons without assimilation ""of money and other things is better'"" than your tribute that you make for me, for I have no need of it, and I will make for you the barrier as a donation ""so help me with strength"" for what I ask of you ""I will make between you and them a dam"" a strong barrier.

""So what They were able to make it appear, that is, Gog and Magog, rise above its back because of its height and smoothness, but they were not able to pierce it, because of its hardness and thickness. Dhul-Qarnayn said, “This,” that is, the dam, that is, the decree over it, “is a mercy from my Lord,” a blessing because it prevents them from coming out. “But when the promise of my Lord comes,” of their imminent coming out of the Resurrection, “He will make it level,” crushed and spread out. “And the promise of my Lord,” of their coming out and other things, “is ever true,” God Almighty said."
j-0609	"“And We will leave some of them that Day” the day of their emergence “surging against others” mixing with them because of their great number “and the Trumpet will be blown” that is, the horn for the resurrection “and We will gather them” that is, the creatures in one place on the Day of Resurrection “in a gathering”
“And We will present” bring near “Hell that Day to the disbelievers, presenting”
“whose eyes” instead of the disbelievers “were covered from My remembrance” that is, the Qur’an, so they were blind and could not be guided by it “and they were unable to hear” that is, they were unable to hear what the Prophet recites to them out of hatred for him, so they do not believe in him
“Do those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants” that is, My angels, Jesus and Ezra “besides Me as protectors” lords, the second object of “to take” and the second object of “to have” is omitted in meaning. They think that the mentioned taking does not anger Me and I will not punish them for it. No! “Indeed, We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers” these and others “as a lodging” that is, it is prepared for them like a house prepared for a guest
“Say, ‘Shall We inform you? “Those who have lost their deeds” distinguishes the distinguishing and distinguishes them by saying “those whose effort is lost in worldly life” their work is in vain “while they think” they think “that they are doing well” work for which they will be rewarded
“Those are the ones who disbelieved in the signs of their Lord” in the evidence of His Oneness from the Qur’an and other things “and in the meeting with Him” that is, in the resurrection, the reckoning, the reward and the punishment “so their deeds have become worthless” they have become worthless “so We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight” that is, We will not assign to them any value

The accusative is for differentiation. ‘Say, ‘I am only a human being like you. It has been revealed to me that your God is one God’ that is, the word ‘that’ is hidden from me, remaining in its source, and the meaning is that the oneness of God is revealed to me. ‘So whoever hopes’ hopes ‘for the meeting with his Lord’ in resurrection and recompense ‘let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord’ meaning in it by showing off ‘anyone.’”
j-0612	"""Kaf Ha Ya Ain Sad"" Allah knows best what He meant by that

This is ""a mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant"" the object of mercy ""Zachariah"" an explanation of it

""When"" related to mercy ""he called upon his Lord with a call"" including a secret supplication ""in secret"" secretly in the depths of the night because He was quick to respond

""He said, ""My Lord, indeed my bones have become feeble"" all of them ""and my head is ablaze"" from me ""with gray hair"" a distinguishing feature transferred from the subject, meaning the gray hair has spread in his hair as the rays of fire spread in wood, and I want to call upon You ""and I have never been in Your supplication"" that is, in my supplication to You ""my Lord, unhappy"" that is, disappointed in what has passed, so do not disappoint me in what is to come

""to inherit me"" in the jussive the answer to the command and in the nominative Description of a guardian “and he inherits” in both ways “from the family of Jacob” my grandfather in knowledge and prophecy “and make him, my Lord, pleasing” meaning pleasing to You. God Almighty said in response to his request for a son through whom He bestowed His mercy

“O Zachariah, indeed We give you good tidings of a boy” who will inherit as you asked “his name is John. We have not made for him before any namesake” meaning anyone named John

“He said, “My Lord, how can I have a boy while my wife is barren and I have reached extreme old age” from “ata” which means the end of life, one hundred and twenty years, and his wife reached ninety-eight years. The root of “ata” is “ata” and the “ta” was broken for ease and the first “waw” was changed to a “ya” to suit the “kasra” and the second to a “ya” so that the “ya” could be assimilated into it

“He said” the matter “thus” who created a boy from you two “your Lord said, it is easy for Me” meaning that I should restore to you the power of intercourse and open your wife’s womb for conception “and I created you before, while you were nothing” before your creation and to show God this great power He inspired him to ask so that he could be answered With what indicates it and when his soul yearned for the speed of the one who was given glad tidings

He said, “My Lord, make a sign” meaning a sign of my wife’s pregnancy. “He said, ‘Your sign’ is that you will not speak to the people” meaning that you will refrain from speaking to them in contrast to the remembrance of God “for three nights” meaning the days thereof as in Al Imran three days “in a row” a state of the subject of the verb “spoke” meaning without a reason

“So he came out to his people from the sanctuary” meaning the mosque and they were waiting for it to be opened so that they could pray in it by his command as is customary “and he inspired” he pointed “to them to glorify” pray “morning and evening” early and late in the day as is customary, so he knew that he was prevented from speaking to them, her pregnancy with John, and two years after his birth God Almighty said to him"
j-0613	“O Yahya, take the Book” meaning the Torah “with strength” seriously “and We gave him wisdom” prophethood “while a boy” three years old “and compassion” mercy for the people “from Us” from Us “and purity” charity to them “and he was righteous” it was narrated that he did not commit a sin and did not intend to do it “and dutiful to his parents” meaning kind to them “and he was not a tyrant” arrogant “disobedient” disobedient to his Lord “and peace” from Us “upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive” meaning in these frightening days in which he sees what he has not seen before, so he is safe in them
j-0614	“And mention in the Book” the Qur’an “Mary” that is, her story “when” when “she withdrew from her family to a place in the East” that is, she secluded herself in a place towards the east of the house “and took a veil from them” she sent a curtain to conceal herself with to comb her hair or her clothes or to wash from her menstruation “then We sent to her Our Spirit” Gabriel “and he appeared to her” by putting on her clothes “as a well-proportioned man” perfect in creation “she said, ‘Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Gracious from you, if you should be fearing God’” so she stopped seeking refuge from Me “He said, ‘I am only the messenger of your Lord that He may bestow upon you a pure boy’” with prophethood “she said, ‘How can I have a boy when no man has touched me’” who marries “nor am I unchaste’” an adulteress “He said, ‘Thus’” who created a boy from you without a father “Your Lord said, ‘It is easy for Me’” that is, that Gabriel should breathe My command into you so that you become pregnant with him. And since what was mentioned is in the sense of a cause, it is conjoined with “and that We may make him a perfect man” A sign for mankind, according to Our power, and a mercy from Us, for those who believe in Him. And His creation was a matter decreed, in My knowledge. So Gabriel blew into the pocket of her garment, and she felt the pregnancy in her womb, depicted. So she carried him and withdrew with him to a remote place, far from her family. Then the labor pains came to her, the pain of childbirth, to the trunk of the palm tree, so that she could lean on it, and she gave birth. The pregnancy, the depiction, and the birth were in an hour. She said, “Oh, would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and forgotten.” Something that is left out, not known or remembered. Then he called to her from beneath her, meaning Gabriel, who was below her, “Do not grieve. Your Lord has provided beneath you a stream,” a river of water that had been cut off. “And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree,” it was dry, and the ba’ is an extra letter. “It will fall,” its original form was with two ta’s, the second of which was changed to a sin and assimilated into the sin. In a reading, it was left out. “Upon you fresh dates,” a distinguishing feature, “ripe dates,” its description. «Eat» of the dates «and drink» of the secret «and be refreshed» with the child, a specification converted from the agent, meaning that your eye may be refreshed with him, meaning that you may be at peace and not aspire to anyone else «Then if» in it there is an assimilation of the nun of inna in the extra ma «you see» from which the lam of the verb and its ‘ayn were deleted and its vowel was placed on the ra’ ​​and the ya of the pronoun was broken due to the meeting of two quiescent letters «of mankind anyone» so he asks you about your child «then say, “Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Merciful a fast” meaning refraining from speaking about him and other people as evidenced by «I will not speak to any human being today” meaning after that «So she brought him to her people, carrying him» a state of them seeing him «They said, “O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented” great, since you have brought a child without a father «O sister of Aaron” he is a righteous man, meaning you are similar to him in chastity «your father was not a man of evil” meaning a fornicator «nor was your mother unchaste» a fornicator, so from where did you get this child? «So she pointed» to them «to him» that they spoke to him «They said, How? We speak to him who was a child in the cradle. He said, “Indeed, I am a servant of God. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet.” “And has made me blessed wherever I may be.” “And has enjoined upon me prayer and zakat as long as I live.” “And dutiful to my mother.” “And has not made me a tyrant,” “arrogant,” “unhappy,” disobedient to his Lord. “And peace,” from God, “is upon me the day I was born and the day I die and the day I am raised alive.” What was said about Mr. Yahya is what was mentioned above. God Almighty said:
j-0615	"""That is Jesus, the son of Mary, the word of truth"" in the nominative case, the predicate of the implied subject, i.e. the word of the son of Mary, and in the accusative case, with the estimation of I said, and the meaning is the true word ""about which they are in doubt"" from the doubt, i.e. they doubt, and they are the Christians, they said that Jesus is the son of God, they lied. ""It is not for God to take a son, glory be to Him"", absolving Him from that. ""When He decrees a matter"", i.e. He wants to bring it about, ""He only says to it, 'Be,' and it is"" in the nominative case, with the estimation of He, and in the accusative case, with the estimation of that, and from that is the creation of Jesus without a father. ""And God is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him"" ​​with the opening of that, with the estimation of remember, and with the breaking of it, with the estimation of say, as evidence of which I said to them nothing but what You commanded me, that is, worship God, my Lord and your Lord. This that was mentioned is a straight path leading to Paradise. ""Then the parties differed among themselves"", i.e. the Christians, about Jesus, is he the son of God or a god with him or the third of three. ""So woe"", severe torment ""for those who disbelieved"" in what was mentioned and other things ""from the sight of a tremendous Day"", i.e. the presence of the Day of Resurrection and its terrors. ""I hear of them and I see"" with them, both forms It is astonishing in the sense of what I hear and what I see “On the Day they come to Us” in the Hereafter “but the wrongdoers” by making the apparent the place of the implied “Today” that is, in this world “are in manifest error” that is, it is clear that they are deaf to hearing the truth and blind to seeing it. That is, I am astonished at them, O you who are being addressed, at their hearing and seeing in the Hereafter after they were deaf and blind in this world. “And warn them” fear, O Muhammad, the infidels of Mecca “of the Day of Regret” that is the Day of Resurrection on which the wrongdoer will regret abandoning goodness in this world “when the matter has been decided” for them on it with punishment “and they” in this world “are in heedlessness” of it “and they do not believe” in it. “Indeed, it is We” to emphasize “who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it” of rational beings and others by their destruction “and to Us they will be returned” on it for recompense."
j-0616	"""And mention"" to them ""in the Book, Abraham"" that is, his story ""for he was a man of truth"" who was extremely truthful ""and a prophet"" and his story is replaced
""When he said to his father"" Azar ""O my father"" the taa replaces the yaa of addition and they are not combined and he worshipped idols ""Why do you worship that which does not hear or see and does not avail you at all"" of benefit or harm? ""O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to a straight path"" a straight path ""O my father, do not worship Satan"" by obeying him in worshipping idols ""For Satan has been disobedient to the Most Merciful"" often disobedient
""O my father, indeed I fear that a punishment from the Most Merciful will afflict you"" if you do not repent ""and you will be to Satan a friend"" a helper and companion in the Fire
""He said, 'Do you turn away from my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist"" from attacking them ""I will stone you"" with stones or with ugly words, so beware of me ""And leave me alone for a long time"" for a long time

He said, ""Peace be upon you from Me"" meaning, ""No harm will befall you. I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. He has been gracious to me"" meaning, ""Kind to me"", so He answers my prayer. He fulfilled His promise mentioned in Ash-Shu'ara', and forgive my father. This was before it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God, as He mentioned in Bara'ah

""And I will leave you and what you call upon"" you worship ""besides God, and I will call upon"" I worship ""my Lord, perhaps I will not be, in calling upon my Lord"" in worshipping Him, ""unhappy"" as you were made miserable in worshipping idols

""So when he left them and what they worshipped besides God"" by going to the Holy Land ""We bestowed upon him"" two sons with whom he would find comfort ""Isaac and Jacob, and each"" of them ""We made a prophet""

""And We bestowed upon them"" the three ""from Our mercy"" wealth and children ""and We made for them a reputation of truth, high"" high, which is the good praise among all people of religions"
j-0617	"""And mention in the Book Moses. Indeed, he was sincere"" with a kasra or fatha from the one who was sincere in his worship and God saved him from defilement ""and he was a messenger, a prophet""

And We called to him, saying, ""O Moses, indeed I am God"" from the side of the mountain on the right, meaning the one on the right of Moses when he came from Midian, and we brought him close, discreetly, by making him hear God Almighty's speech

And We made easy for him from Our mercy"" Our favor ""his brother Aaron"" a substitute or an explanatory apposition ""a prophet"" a state intended by the gift in response to his request to send his brother with him, and he was older than him

And mention in the Book Ishmael. Indeed, he was true to his promise"" He did not promise anything without fulfilling it, and he waited for three days or a year from his promise until he returned to him in his place ""and he was a messenger"" to Jurhum ""a prophet""

""And he used to enjoin his family"" meaning his people ""to pray and to give zakat, and he was acceptable to his Lord"" its root is mardu, the two waws were accepted as two ya's and the damma was a kasra

""And mention in the Book Idris"" he is the grandfather Abu Nuh ""He was a man of truth and a prophet."" ""And We raised him to a high station."" He is alive in the fourth, sixth, or seventh heaven, or in Paradise, which he entered after he tasted death and was revived, but he did not leave it. ""Those"" is the subject. ""On whom Allah bestowed favor"" is an attribute of him. ""Of the prophets"" is an explanation of him, and it is in the meaning of an attribute. What follows it to the conditional clause is an attribute of the prophets. So his saying ""Of the descendants of Adam"" means Idris. ""And of those We carried with Noah"" in the ship, meaning Abraham, the son of his grandson Sam. ""And of the descendants of Abraham"" means Ishmael, Isaac, and Jacob. ""And"" of the descendants of ""Israel"" is Jacob, meaning Moses, Aaron, Zechariah, John, and Jesus.

j-0637	“Likewise,” that is, just as We related to you, O Muhammad, this story, “We relate to you some of the news,” news of “what preceded,” of the nations, “and We have given you,” We gave you, “from Us,” from Us, “a reminder,” a Qur’an. “Whoever turns away from it,” and does not believe in it, “he will bear on the Day of Resurrection a burden,” a heavy burden of sin, “abiding eternally therein,” that is, in the torment of the burden. “And evil for them on the Day of Resurrection is a bearing,” a distinguishing feature of the pronoun in “sa’a,” and the one specifically blamed is omitted, its meaning being their burden, and the lam is for clarification, and it is substituted for the Day of Resurrection.
j-0638	"“On the Day We shall blow the Trumpet” the second blast “and We shall gather the criminals” the disbelievers “on that Day blue” their eyes with black faces

“They will whisper among themselves” they will whisper “You have not tarried” in this world “except ten” of nights with their days

“We know best what they say” in that, that is, it is not as they said “when the best of them” the most just of them “in manner” in it “will say, ‘You have tarried but a day’” they will think their tarrying in this world very little in light of what they will witness in the Hereafter of its terrors

“And they will ask you about the mountains” how they will be on the Day of Resurrection “so say” to them “My Lord will blow them away with a blast” by crushing them like liquid sand and then blowing them away with the winds

“And He will leave them as a plain” flat “and level”
“You will not see therein any crookedness” lowness “nor any irregularity” highness

“On that Day” that is, the day when the mountains are blown away “they will follow” that is, the people after rising from the graves “the caller” to the place of assembly with his voice, and he is Israfil, saying, “Come on.” To the presentation of the Most Gracious, “there is no crookedness in it,” that is, in their following, that is, they are not able to avoid tiring themselves, “and the voices will be humbled,” they will be stilled, “before the Most Gracious, and you will hear nothing but a whisper,” the sound of the trampling of feet in transporting them to the place of assembly, like the sound of the hooves of camels in their gait.

“On that Day, no intercession will benefit,” anyone, “except for one to whom the Most Gracious has given permission,” to intercede for him, “and whose word is acceptable,” by saying, “There is no god but God.” “He knows what is before them,” of the affairs of the Hereafter, “and what is behind them,” of the affairs of this world, “and they do not encompass it in knowledge,” they do not know that.

“And faces will be humbled,” they will submit, “before the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining,” that is, God, “and he will fail,” he will lose, “whoever bears injustice,” that is, polytheism.

“And whoever does righteous deeds,” acts of obedience, “while he is a believer, will fear neither injustice,” an increase in his bad deeds, “nor deprivation,” a decrease in his good deeds.

“And thus,” conjoined with thus, decrease, that is, like the revelation of what was mentioned, “We have revealed it,” that is, the Qur’an, “an Arabic Qur’an, and We have diversified,” we repeated, “in it of The threat is that they may fear polytheism or the Qur’an may cause them to be reminded of the destruction of the nations that came before them, so that they may take heed."
j-0639	“So exalted is God, the King, the Truth” above what the polytheists say. “And do not hasten with the Qur’an” that is, with its recitation “before its revelation is completed to you” that is, Gabriel finishes conveying it “and say, ‘My Lord, increase me in knowledge’” that is, with the Qur’an. So whenever it is revealed to him, his knowledge increases.
j-0640	"“And We had already made a covenant with Adam” We commanded him not to eat from the tree “before” that is, before he ate from it “but he forgot” he abandoned Our covenant “and We found on his part no firm resolve” firmness and patience in what We forbade him from

And remember when We said to the angels, “Prostrate to Adam,” and they prostrated, except for Iblis, the father of the jinn, who used to accompany the angels and worship Allah with them. He refused to prostrate to Adam and said, “I am better than he.”

“So We said, ‘O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife’” Eve with a long vowel “so let him not expel you from Paradise and you become miserable” she tires herself out with plowing, planting, harvesting, grinding, baking bread, and other things. And He limited his misery to that because the man strives for his wife

“For you” “you will neither hunger therein nor be naked”

“And you” with a fatha on the hamza and a kasra in apposition to the name of “in” and its sentence “you will neither thirst therein” thirst “nor experience the sun’s heat therein” you will not experience the heat of the forenoon sun because the sun is absent in Paradise

“Then Satan whispered to him, he said, ‘O Adam, shall I direct you to the tree of immortality?’” that is, the one in which one will live forever Whoever eats from it, “and a kingdom that will not decay,” will not perish and will remain eternal. “So they ate,” that is, Adam and Eve, “from it, and their private parts became apparent to them,” that is, each of them became exposed to the other’s front, back, and back. Each of them was called private parts because its exposure would disgrace the other. “And they began to fasten together,” they began to stick, “over themselves from the leaves of Paradise,” to conceal themselves with it. “And Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray,” by eating from the tree. “Then his Lord chose him,” brought him near, “and turned to him in forgiveness,” before his repentance, “and guided,” that is, guided him to persist in repentance."
j-0641	“He said, ‘Descend both of you,’ that is, Adam and Eve, with what We have included of your offspring, ‘from it,’ from Paradise, ‘all of you, enemies to one another,’ from the oppression of some of them by others. ‘Then if’ there comes to you guidance from Me, then whoever follows My guidance, the Qur’an, ‘will neither go astray’ in this world, ‘nor be miserable,’ in the Hereafter. ‘But whoever turns away from My remembrance,’ the Qur’an, ‘will have a depressed life,’ with the tanween, a source meaning narrow, and it was explained in a hadith as the punishment of the disbeliever in his grave. ‘And We will gather him,’ that is, the one who turns away from the Qur’an, ‘on the Day of Resurrection blind,’ blind of sight. ‘He will say, ‘My Lord, why have You gathered me blind, while I was seeing,’ in this world and at the Resurrection? ’ He said, ‘The command, ‘Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot them,’ you left them and did not believe in them. ‘And thus, like your forgetting Our signs, ‘this Day you are forgotten,’ you are left in the Fire. ’ ‘And thus,’ and like Our recompense for those who turn away from the Qur’an, ‘We recompense him who transgressed, associated others with Allah, ‘and did not believe. By the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting.

Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers” in my leaving from among my people without permission “so We responded to him and saved him from the distress” with those words “and thus” as We saved him “We save the believers” from their distress when they call upon Us, supplicating
j-0661	“And” mention “Zachariah” and it is replaced by “when he called upon his Lord” by saying “My Lord, leave me not alone” that is, without a son to inherit me “and You are the best of inheritors” the one who remains after the annihilation of Your creation “So We responded to him” his call “and We gave him John” a son “and We made his wife good for him” so she gave birth to a son after her barrenness “Indeed, they” that is, those of the prophets mentioned “used to hasten” they would hasten “to good deeds” acts of obedience “and supplicate Us in hope” for Our mercy “and in fear” of Our punishment “and they were to Us humbly submissive” humble in their worship
j-0662	“And” mention Mary “who guarded her chastity” she protected it from being violated “so We breathed into her of Our spirit” meaning Gabriel when he breathed into the pocket of her garment and she became pregnant with Jesus “and We made her and her son a sign for the worlds” mankind, jinn and angels when she gave birth to him without a male.

“And they” that is, some of those being addressed “divided their affair among themselves” that is, they divided their affair into their religion, differing in it, and they are the sects of the Jews and Christians. God Almighty said “all to Us will return” that is, We will reward him for his deeds

“So whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer - there is no denial” that is, no ingratitude “for his effort, and indeed, We are its recorders” by ordering the guardians to write it down and rewarding him for it

“And it is forbidden for a city which We have destroyed” I mean its people “that they will not” redundant “return” that is, it is impossible for them to return to the world"

j-0666	“On the Day” is governed by “Idkhar” which is understood before it. “We will roll up the heaven like the rolling up of a scroll” is the name of a king. “For the Book” is the scroll of the son of Adam upon his death. The lam is redundant, or the scroll is the scroll. The book means what is written, and the lam means upon. In a reading of the books, they are plural. “As we began the first creation” from nothing. “We will repeat it” after its destruction. So the kaf is related to “return” and its pronoun refers to the first. “Ma” is a source. “A promise upon Us” is governed by “Our promise” which is understood before it and it confirms the content of what came before it. “Indeed, We wrote in the Psalms” meaning the book, that is, the revealed books of God “after the remembrance” meaning the mother of the book that is with God “that the earth” the land of Paradise “will be inherited by My righteous servants” general for every righteous person. “Indeed, in this” the Qur’an “is a message” sufficient for entering Paradise “for a people who worship” who act upon it.
j-0667	“And We have not sent you,” O Muhammad, “except as a mercy,” that is, for mercy, “to the worlds,” mankind and jinn through you. “Say, ‘It is only revealed to me that your god is one God.’” That is, what is revealed to me regarding the matter of God is nothing but His oneness. “So are you Muslims?” Submissive to what is revealed to me regarding the oneness of God? The question is in the sense of a command. “But if they turn away,” from that, “say, ‘I have warned you,’ I have informed you of war, “on an equal footing,” a state of the subject and the object, that is, equal in His knowledge. I do not take it over without you, so that you may prepare. “And I do not know whether what you are promised is near or far,” of the punishment or the Resurrection that includes it, and only God knows it. “He knows what is said aloud,” and what is done by you and others, “and He knows what you conceal,” you and others of secrets. “And I do not know, perhaps it is,” that is, what I have informed you of, but He does not know its time, “a trial,” a test, “for you,” to see how He has made you, “and an enjoyment,” a pleasure, “for a time,” that is, an expiration. Your appointed times. This is the opposite of the first, which is hoped for, perhaps, and the second is not a place for hope. Say, and in a reading, He said, “My Lord, judge between me and those who deny me, with the truth, by punishment for them or victory over them.” So they were punished at Badr, Uhud, Hunayn, the Confederates, and the Trench, and He gave victory over them. And our Lord, the Most Gracious, is the One sought for help against what you describe of your lie against God in your saying, “He has taken a son,” and against me in your saying, “He is a magician,” and against the Qur’an in your saying, “Poetry.”
j-0668	“O mankind,” that is, the people of Mecca and others, “fear your Lord,” that is, His punishment by obeying Him. “Indeed, the earthquake of the Hour,” that is, the violent shaking of the earth after which the sun will rise from the West, which is near the Hour, “is a terrible thing,” in disturbing people, which is a kind of punishment. “On the Day you see it, every nursing mother will be distracted,” because of it, in fact, “from what she nursed,” that is, she will forget it, “and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the people as if they were drunk,” from intense fear, “but they will not be drunk,” from drinking, “but the punishment of Allah is severe,” so they fear it.
j-0669	It was revealed about Al-Nadr ibn Al-Harith and his group: “And among mankind is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge.” They said that the angels are daughters of Allah and the Qur’an is legends of the ancients and they denied the resurrection and the revival of those who have become dust. “And follows” in his argument “every rebellious devil.” That is, one who rebels. “It is decreed for him” it was decreed for Satan “that whoever takes him as a friend” that is, follows him “he will mislead him and guide him” he calls him “to the punishment of the Blaze” that is, the Fire.

j-0678	"""Allah defends those who believe"" the plots of the polytheists ""Allah does not like any traitor"" in His trust ""ungrateful"" for His blessings, and they are the polytheists. The meaning is that He punishes them. ""Permission is given to those who fight"" that is, to the believers to fight, and this is the first verse revealed about jihad ""because they"" that is, because they ""have been wronged"" because the disbelievers wronged them ""and indeed, Allah is able to give them victory"" they are ""those who have been expelled from their homes without right"" in the expulsion they were not expelled ""except that they say"" that is, by saying ""Our Lord is Allah"" alone, and this saying is true, so expulsion by it is expulsion without right ""and if Allah did not repel some people"" instead of some people ""there would have been demolished"" with emphasis for multiplication and with emphasis for multiplication and with emphasis ""monasteries"" for monks ""and churches"" for Christians ""and synagogues"" for Jews in Hebrew ""and mosques"" for Muslims ""in which"" that is, the mentioned places ""the name of Allah is much mentioned"" and worship is cut off by their destruction ""and Allah will surely aid those who aid Him"" ​​that is He supports his religion. “Indeed, Allah is Powerful” over his creation. “Mighty” is impregnable in his authority and power. “Those whose place on earth” is through their victory over their enemy. “They establish prayer and give zakat and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong.” The answer to the condition is that it and its answer are the relative clause.

j-0679	"“And if they deny you” to the end, it is a consolation for the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace. “Then before them were denied the people of Noah” the feminine gender of “people” is taken into consideration the meaning. “And ‘Aad” the people of Hud “and Thamud” the people of Salih “and the people of Abraham and the people of Lot” the people of Shu’ayb “and Moses denied” the Copts denied him, not his people, the Children of Israel, meaning these people denied their messengers, so you have an example with them. “So I granted respite to the disbelievers” I gave them respite by delaying the punishment for them “and then I seized them” with the punishment “so how was My denial” meaning My denial is Knowing of their denial by destroying them. The question is for confirmation, meaning it will take its place. “How many” meaning how many “towns have I destroyed” and in another reading, “destroyed” “while they were unjust” meaning I made them desolate because of their disbelief “so they are empty” fallen “on their thrones” their roofs “and” how many “wells that are unused” abandoned because of the death of their people “and lofty palaces” empty because of the death of their people His people

j-0680	“And they urge you to hasten the punishment, but God will not fail in His promise” to send down the punishment, so He sent it down on the day of Badr. “And indeed, a day with your Lord” of the days of the Hereafter because of the punishment “is like a thousand years of what you count” with the ta’ and the ya’ in this world. “And how many a town was I granted respite while it was wrongdoing, then I seized it” meaning its people “and to me is the destination” the reference.

In another reading, “to cause failure and to outpace us,” that is, they think that they will escape us by denying the resurrection and punishment. “Those are the companions of Hellfire,” the Fire.
j-0682	“And We did not send before you any messenger” who is a prophet who was commanded to convey the message “nor any prophet” that is, he was not commanded to convey the message “except that when he wished” he read “Satan threw into his wish” his reading something that is not from the Qur’an that the one to whom he was sent would be pleased. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, recited in Surat An-Najm in a gathering of the Quraysh after “Have you considered Al-Lat and Al-Uzza and Manat, the third, the other” with Satan throwing it on his tongue without his knowledge, may God bless him and grant him peace, “Those are the exalted cranes, and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for.” So they rejoiced at that. Then Gabriel informed him of what Satan threw on his tongue of that with sadness, so he was comforted by this verse to be reassured. “Then God abrogates” He nullifies “what Satan throws in, then God establishes His verses” He confirms them. “And God is Knowing” of Satan throwing in what was mentioned. “Wise” in His ability to do what He wills. “That He may make what Satan throws in a trial” a trial “for those in whose hearts is disease” dissension and hypocrisy “and those whose hearts are hardened” that is, the polytheists who refuse to accept the truth. “And indeed, the wrongdoers” the disbelievers “are in extreme dissension” a long dispute.

Indeed, Allah is Pardoning” of the believers “and Forgiving” of them for fighting them in the sacred month “that” victory “is because Allah merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night” that is, he merges each of them into the other by increasing the effect of His Almighty power through which victory is achieved “and indeed, Allah is Hearing” of the supplication of the believers “and Seeing” of them since He has placed faith in them He answered their prayer.

“That” victory also “is because God is the truth” the established “and that what they call upon” with the letter “ya” and the letter “ta” they worship “besides Him” which are idols “is falsehood” the vanishing “and that God is the Most High” that is, the Highest over everything by His power “the Great” who makes everything else small.

“Have you not seen” you know “that God sends down water” from the sky “and the earth becomes green” with plants, and this is from the effect of His power “God is Kind” to His servants in bringing forth plants with water “Acquainted” with what is in their hearts when the rain is delayed.

“To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth” in terms of dominion “and God is the Free of need” of His servants “the Praiseworthy” for His friends.

“Have you not seen” you know “that God has subjected to you whatever is on the earth” of animals “and the ships” the ships “running through the sea” for riding and carrying “by His command” with His permission “and He holds the heaven” from “that” or so that “it does not fall upon the earth except by His permission” so that you perish “God is to the people Kind and Merciful” in Subjugation and withholding
“And it is He who gave you life” by creating “then He will cause you to die” at the end of your appointed times “then He will bring you to life” at the resurrection “Indeed, man” meaning the polytheist “is ungrateful” for God’s blessings by abandoning His monotheism."

And the women were light, they only ate a little food, and I found my necklace and came after they had departed, so I sat in the house where I was and I thought that the people would miss me and return to me, but my eyes overcame me and I slept. Safwan had gotten married behind the army and set out at night. They are with emphasis on the ra and dal, meaning he went down at the end of the night to rest, so he walked from it and became at his home and saw the blackness of a sleeping person, meaning his person, so he recognized me when he saw me, and he used to see me before the veil, so I woke up with a sigh.

""Had it not been"", ""why"", ""when"" when ""you heard it, the believing men and believing women thought well of themselves"", meaning of each other ""and said, 'This is an obvious falsehood'"" a clear lie in which there is a shift from the address, meaning you thought, O group, and said

""Had it not been"", meaning the group, ""brought four witnesses"" against him, they witnessed him. ""But for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, a great punishment would have touched you for what you disclosed"", O group, meaning what you indulged in. ""Therein is a great punishment"" in the Hereafter

""When you receive it with your tongues"", meaning you see it from each other, and one of the two ta's was deleted from the verb. And when is in the accusative case with ""masakum"" or ""bi-afadtum"" ""and you say with your mouths what you do not have"" Knowledge and you think it is insignificant, there is no sin in it, while it is grave in the sight of God, in sin. And had you not, when you heard it, said, “It is not right for us to speak of this. Glory be to You,” here it is for astonishment, “this is a slander,” a “monumental” lie. God admonishes you, forbids you, “that you should ever return to the like of it, if you are believers,” you learn from that. And God makes clear to you the signs, in the commands and prohibitions, “and God is Knowing,” in what He commands and prohibits, “Wise,” in it."
j-0704	“Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread among those who have believed” by the tongue “for them is a painful punishment in this world” by the punishment for slander “and in the Hereafter” by the Fire, according to the right of God. “And God knows” that it is absent from them “and you” O group, because of what you said of the slander “do not know” that it is present among them. “And were it not for the grace of God upon you” O group “and His mercy and that God is Kind and Merciful” towards you, He would have hastened the punishment upon you.
j-0705	“O you who believe! Follow not the footsteps of Satan. And whoever follows the footsteps of Satan, he commands immorality and wrongdoing. And if it were not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, not one of you would ever be pure. But Allah purifies whom He wills from the sin by accepting his repentance. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. And let not those of wealth and plenty among you swear not to give to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants in the cause of Allah.” It was revealed about Abu Bakr, who swore not to spend on Mistah, his cousin, a poor emigrant from Badr, when he engaged in the slander after he had been spending on him. And some of the Companions swore not to give charity to anyone who spoke any slander. “And let them pardon and overlook.” “Do you not love that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving and Merciful.” To the believers, Abu Bakr said, “Yes, I love that God should forgive me.” And he returned to Mistah what he had been spending on him.
j-0706	"""Those who accuse chaste women, who are unaware of immoralities, believing women, of Allah and His Messenger, of adultery are cursed in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have a great punishment."" ""On the Day"" the subject of the word is stability, which is attached to them, ""their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do,"" of words and deeds, which is the Day of Resurrection. ""On that Day Allah will pay them their due recompense,"" He will reward them with the recompense that is due to them, ""and they will know that Allah is the manifest truth,"" as He has fulfilled for them the recompense that they had doubted, and among them is Abdullah ibn Ubayy. The chaste women here are the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. Repentance was not mentioned in their accusation, and those who were mentioned in their accusation at the beginning of Surat At-Tawbah were others. ""The evil ones"" of women and of the words ""for the evil ones"" of people, ""and the evil ones"" of people, ""for the evil ones"" of what was mentioned, ""and the good ones"" of what was mentioned, ""for the good ones"" of people, ""and the good ones"" of them. “For the good women” of what was mentioned, that is, what is appropriate for the bad like it and for the good like it. “Those” the good men and women, including Aisha and Safwan, “are innocent of what they say” that is, the bad men and women among them. “For them” the good men and women, “is forgiveness and generous provision” in Paradise. Aisha boasted about things, including that she was created good and was promised forgiveness and generous provision."
j-0707	“O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you have asked permission” meaning ask permission “and greeted their inhabitants” so one says, “Peace be upon you, may I enter” as mentioned in the hadith “That is better for you” than entering without permission “that you may remember” by assimilating the second ta’ into the dhal of its goodness and act upon it. “But if you do not find anyone therein” who gives you permission “then do not enter it until permission is given to you. And if it is said to you” after asking permission “Go back, then go back. It is purer” meaning better “for you” than sitting at the door. “And Allah, of what you do” of entering with or without permission “is Knowing” so He will reward you for it. “There is no blame upon you for entering houses that are not inhabited in which there is provision” meaning benefit “for you” by being secluded or otherwise, such as houses of attachments and inns with open doors “and Allah knows what you reveal” what you reveal “and what you conceal” what you conceal in entering other than your own houses for the purpose of righteousness or otherwise. And it will come that when they enter their houses they greet themselves”
j-0708	"""Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their private parts, that is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do, with their eyes and private parts, and He will reward them for it. ""And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts, and not display their adornment except that which is apparent thereof, that is, the face and hands. It is permissible for a stranger to look at it if he does not fear temptation, according to one of two views. The second view is forbidden, because it is a source of temptation, and it is preferred to close the door. ""And let them draw their veils over their bosoms, that is, cover their heads, necks, and chests with veils, and not display their adornment, hidden, which is everything except the face and hands, except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husbands' fathers, or their sons, or their husbands' sons, or their brothers, or their brothers' sons, or their brothers' sons, or their sisters ... Their brothers, or their women, or what their right hands possess.” It is permissible for them to look at it, except for what is between the navel and the knee, in which case it is forbidden for anyone other than their husbands to look at it. He excluded from their wives the infidels, so it is not permissible for Muslim women to uncover themselves to them, and what their right hands possess includes slaves. “Or those who follow them” in the surplus of food. “Other than” in the accusative case as an attribute and the accusative case as an exception. “Of those who have desire” those who need women “of men” because the mention of all of them has not spread. “Or the child” meaning the children “who have not yet appeared” see “the private parts of women” for intercourse, so it is permissible for them to show them what is between the navel and the knee. “And let them not stamp their feet so that what they hide of their adornment may be known” of a rattling anklet. “And repent to Allah, all of you, O believers” for what happened to you of the forbidden looking and other things “that you may succeed” you may be saved from that because repentance from it is accepted. And in the verse there is a predominance of males over females."
j-0709	“And marry those among you who are single,” the plural of ayym, which is one who has no husband, whether a virgin or a woman who has not been married, and those who have no husband. This applies to free men and women, “and the righteous,” the believers, “among your male and female slaves,” and “abd” is from the plural of “abd.” “If they,” that is, the free men, “are poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty. And Allah is All-Encompassing,” of His creation, “and Knowing,” of them. “And let those who do not find the means for marriage keep themselves chaste,” what they can marry with of dowry and maintenance, from fornication, “until Allah enriches them,” is generous to them, “from His bounty,” so they marry. “And those who seek a contract,” meaning a contract of manumission, “from those whom your right hands possess,” of male and female slaves, “then contract them if you know good in them,” that is, trustworthiness and the ability to earn to pay the money of the contract. Its formula is, for example, “I contracted with you for two thousand in two months, one thousand each month, so if you pay it, you are free.” He says, “I accept.” “And give them,” an order to the masters, “from the wealth of Allah which He has given you,” what they can use to help them in paying what they have committed to you, and in the same sense. Giving is a reduction of something they have committed to. “And do not compel your female slaves” your female slaves “to prostitution” adultery “if they desire chastity” to abstain from it. This desire is the subject of compulsion, so there is no meaning to the condition. “In order to seek” by compulsion “the goods of worldly life.” It was revealed about Abdullah bin Ubayy who compelled his female slaves to earn money through adultery. “And whoever compels them, then indeed, after their compulsion, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful” to them. “And We have certainly sent down to you clear verses” with the opening of the ya’ and its kasra in this surah, in which what was mentioned is explained or a proof. “And an example” a strange story, which is the story of Aisha “from those who passed on before you” that is, from the same kind as their examples, that is, their strange stories like the story of Joseph and Mary. “And an admonition for the righteous” in the words of God Almighty: “And let not pity therein detain you in the religion of Allah. Had it not been that when you heard it, the believers thought…” and had it not been that when you heard it, you said… “Allah admonishes you to return…” And it is specific to the righteous because they are the ones who benefit from it.
j-0710	“Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth,” meaning He illuminates them with the sun and the moon. “The example of His light,” meaning His description in the heart of the believer, “is as a niche within which is a lamp. The lamp is in glass,” which is the lantern, and the lamp is the lamp, meaning the lit wick, and the niche is the non-penetrating energy, meaning the tube in the lantern. “The glass is as if,” and the light is in it, “a shining star,” meaning shining, with a kasra on the dal and a damma on it from dar’a meaning to push away, to push away darkness, and with a damma on it and a shaddah on the ya’, it is attributed to dar al-lu’lu. “The lamp is lit,” in the past tense, and in another reading, in the present tense or qad, passive with the ta’aniyya, and in another, it is lit with the fawqaniyya, meaning the bottle, “from,” oil, “a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west,” but rather between them, so that neither harmful cold can penetrate it. “Its oil would almost glow even if no fire touched it,” because of its purity. “Light,” with it, “upon light,” with fire, and the light of Allah, meaning He guided the believers, is light upon the light of faith. “Allah guides to His light,” meaning the religion of Islam, “whom He wills, and Allah presents,” explains, “paradigms for the people,” approximately. For their understanding, so that they may consider and believe. “And Allah is Knowing of all things.” And from this is the use of parables. “In houses” related to “glorify” that comes “Allah has permitted to be raised” to be glorified “and His name mentioned therein” by making His oneness “glorify” with the opening of the unified and its breaking, meaning praying “for Him therein in the mornings” a source meaning mornings, meaning early morning “and evenings” after noon. “Men” the subject of “glorify” with the breaking of the ba’ and with its opening is the deputy subject for it and men is the subject of an implied verb in response to an implied question as if it was said who glorifies Him. “Neither trade” buying “nor sale distracts them from the remembrance of Allah and establishing prayer” deleting the ha’ of establishing for alleviation “and giving zakat, fearing a Day when the hearts and eyes will be tossed” from fear, the hearts will be between salvation and destruction and the eyes will be between the right and left sides, and it is the Day of Resurrection. “That Allah may reward them with the best of what they did” meaning His reward and “better” means good “and increase them from His bounty. And Allah provides for whom He wills without account” it is said that someone spends without account, meaning He spends as if he does not calculate what he spends.
j-0711	“And those who disbelieve - their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland.” The plural of “qa’” means “villas,” which is a ray that can be seen in the middle of the day in intense heat, resembling running water. “The thirsty one thinks it is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it nothing.” Likewise, the disbeliever thinks that his deeds, like his truthfulness, benefit him until, when he dies and comes to his Lord, he does not find his deeds, that is, they do not benefit him. “And he finds God with him,” that is, with his deeds, “and He will pay him his due.” That is, He will reward him for them in this world. “And God is swift in account.” That is, in recompense. “Or” those who disbelieve - their evil deeds “are like darknesses within a deep sea, covered by waves above it.” That is, the waves. “Wave above it” that is, the second wave. “Clouds.” That is, clouds. “This is darkness, one above another.” The darkness of the sea, the darkness of the first wave, the darkness of the second, and the darkness of the clouds. “When” the observer “puts out his hand” into this darkness, “he can scarcely see it.” That is, he does not come close to seeing it. “And he for whom God has not appointed light - for him there is no light.” That is, he who has not May Allah guide him, he is not guided
j-0712	“Have you not seen that Allah is glorified by whoever is in the heavens and the earth?” And from glorification is prayer. “And the birds” is a plural of bird between the heaven and the earth. “With their wings spread out” is a state. “Each one has known” Allah “its prayer and its glorification. And Allah is Knowing of what they do” in it is the predominance of the rational. “And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth” is the treasuries of rain, sustenance and plants. “And to Allah is the final destination” is the reference. “Have you not seen that Allah drives the clouds” drives them gently “then brings them together” brings some of them together and makes the scattered pieces one piece “then makes them a mass” some of them on top of others “and you see the rain” the rain “emerging from within it” its outlets “and He sends down from the sky from” an extra “mountains in which” in the sky is a substitute for repeating the preposition “of hail” that is, some of it “and He strikes with it whom He wills and turns it away from whom He wills. Its lightning” brings close “almost takes away the eyes” of those looking at it, that is, snatches them. “Allah alternates the night and the day” that is, He brings each of them Instead of the other, “Indeed in that” the reversal “is a lesson” an indication “for those of insight” of the power of God Almighty. “And God created every moving creature” that is, an animal “from water” sperm “and among them are those that crawl on their bellies” like snakes and vermin “and among them are those that walk on two legs” like humans and birds “and among them are those that walk on four” like cattle and livestock “God creates what He wills. Indeed, God is over all things competent.”
j-0713	“We have sent down clear verses,” that is, clear proofs, which is the Qur’an, “and God guides whom He wills to a straight path,” that is, the religion of Islam. “And they say,” the hypocrites, “We believe,” we believe, “in God,” in His Oneness, “and in the Messenger,” Muhammad, “and we obey,” they both in what they have ruled. “Then a party of them turns away after that,” from him. “And those,” those who turn away, “are not the believers,” those who are known and whose hearts agree with their tongues. “And when they are called to God and His Messenger,” the one who conveys His message, “to judge between them, at once a party of them turn away,” from coming to him. “And if the truth is theirs, they come to him in submission,” hastening and obedient. “Is there in their hearts a disease,” disbelief, “or do they doubt,” that is, doubt his prophethood, “or do they fear that God and His Messenger will wrong them,” in the ruling, that is, that they will be wronged in it? No, “rather, it is those who are the wrongdoers,” by turning away from him. “The only statement of the believers when they are called to God and His Messenger that he may judge between them,” so the appropriate statement is They are to say, “We hear and we obey,” in response. “And those,” then, “are the successful ones,” the survivors. “And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah,” fears Him, “and keeps his duty to Him,” with the ha’ silent and broken, by obeying Him, “they are the successful ones,” of Paradise. “And they swear by Allah with the utmost of their faith,” its limit, “that if you command them,” to jihad, “they will go forth. Say,” to them, “Do not swear. A known obedience,” to the Prophet is better than your oath in which you do not believe, “Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do,” of your obedience in word and your opposition in deed. “Say, ‘Obey Allah and obey the Messenger.’ But if you turn away,” from obeying him by deleting one of the two ta’s, addressing them, “then upon him is only what he is charged with,” of conveying, “and upon you is what you are charged with,” of obeying him, “and if you obey him, you will be guided. And upon the Messenger is nothing but the clear conveyance,” that is, the clear conveyance.
j-0714	"“Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that He will surely make them successors upon the earth” instead of the disbelievers “just as He made successors” in the active and passive form “those before them” of the Children of Israel instead of the tyrant “and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He has approved for them” which is Islam, that it will prevail over all religions and expand the lands for them so that they may own them “and that He will surely substitute for them” with the emphasis and the emphasis “after their fear” of the disbelievers “security” and Allah fulfilled His promise to them with what was mentioned and praised them by saying “they worship Me, not associating anything with Me” which is a new causal construction “and whoever disbelieves after that” from them the blessing of it “then those are the wicked” and the first to disbelieve in Him were the killers of Uthman, may Allah be pleased with him, so they began to fight each other after they had been brothers

“And establish prayer and give zakah and obey the Messenger that you may receive mercy” meaning hope for mercy

“Do not think” with the upper and lower and the subject is the Messenger “that those who disbelieve can escape” us “on the earth” that they will escape us ""And their refuge"" is their reference ""the Fire, and wretched is the destination"" the reference is"
j-0715	"“O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess and those among you who have not yet reached puberty ask permission of you three times before the dawn prayer and when you put off your clothing at noon and after the ‘Isha prayer. These are three times of privacy for you.” In the nominative case, it is the predicate of a subject after it, and the complement takes its place, meaning they are times. In the accusative case, with the estimation of times, it is an accusative in place of what preceded it, and the complement takes its place, and it is for throwing off clothing in which the private parts are exposed. “There is no blame upon you or upon them,” meaning the slaves and children, “for entering upon you without permission after them,” meaning after the three times, “circling around among you,” to serve, “some of you around others,” and the sentence confirms what came before it. “Thus,” as was mentioned, “Allah makes clear to you the signs,” meaning the rulings. “And Allah is Knowing,” of the affairs of His creation, “Wise,” of what He has planned for them. It was said that the verse of asking permission was abrogated, and it was said that it was not, but people were careless in Leaving permission

“And when the children among you reach puberty, O free men, let them ask permission” at all times “as those before them asked permission” that is, the adult free men. “Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.”

“And women who are past menstruation and childbearing, who do not expect marriage” for this reason “there is no blame upon them if they put aside their outer garments” of the jilbab, the cloak, and the veil over the khimar “not displaying themselves” showing “with adornment” lightly such as a necklace, bracelet, and anklet. “But to be chaste” by not putting it away “is better for them. And Allah is Hearing” of your words “and Knowing” of what is in your hearts.

“There is no blame upon the blind or upon the lame or upon the sick” in eating with those opposite them. “And there is no blame upon yourselves if you eat from your houses” your children “or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your aunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or The houses of your aunts, or those whose keys you possess” which you have stored for others “or your friend” which is someone who is sincere in his love for you. The meaning is that it is permissible to eat from the houses of those mentioned even if they are not present if it is known that they are pleased with it. “There is no blame upon you if you eat together” together “or separately” separated, the plural of shtat was revealed for someone who is embarrassed to eat alone and if he does not find someone to eat with, he should leave the food. “So when you enter houses” which are yours and have no people in them “then greet yourselves” say, “Peace be upon us and upon the righteous servants of God” for the angels will respond to you and if there are people in them then greet them “a greeting” of life “from God, blessed and good” for which he will be rewarded. “Thus does God make clear to you the signs” that is, He makes the signs of your religion “preferable for you that you may understand” so that you may understand that."

Indeed, those who ask your permission are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for some of their affairs” he orders them “then give permission to whomever you wish among them” to leave “and ask forgiveness for them from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” “Do not make the calling of the Messenger among you like the calling of one of you to another” by saying “O Muhammad” but rather say “O Prophet of Allah, O Messenger of Allah” in gentleness, humility and a lowered voice. “Allah certainly knows those among you who slip away secretly” meaning they leave the mosque during the sermon without asking permission, secretly, concealing themselves with something. “So let those who oppose his command” meaning Allah and His Messenger “beware lest a trial” calamity “suffer them or a painful punishment” in the Hereafter. “Unquestionably, to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth” kings, descendants and slaves. “He certainly knows what you” you who are charged with responsibility “are doing” of Faith and hypocrisy. “And” He knows “the Day they will be returned to Him” in which there is a shift from addressing the one who is “and He will inform them” in it “of what they did” of good and evil “and God is Knowing of everything” of their deeds and other things.

""And those who disbelieve say, ""This"" that is, what is the Qur'an ""is nothing but a lie"" a lie ""which Muhammad has invented"" and ""and another people have aided him in it"" and they are from the People of the Book.

The second says in everything that I have, “I will not be like the first in everything.” “Will you be patient,” with what you hear from those with whom you have been tested?

God Almighty said: “They have certainly been arrogant” they were arrogant “regarding themselves and have transgressed” they have transgressed “with great transgression” by seeking to see God Almighty in this world. They transgressed with the waw according to its origin, unlike the substitution of ‘ata in Maryam. “The Day they see the angels” among the creation is the Day of Resurrection, and its accusative is with the implied mention “No good news that Day will be given to the criminals” meaning the disbelievers, unlike the believers, for they will have good news of Paradise. “And they will say: A forbidden stone” according to their custom in this world when a hardship befalls them, meaning: a refuge, a refuge, they seek refuge from the angels. God Almighty said: “And We have presented” we intended “to whatever they did of deeds” of good deeds such as charity, maintaining family ties, hosting a guest, and helping the distressed in this world “and We have made it like dust spread out” it is what is seen in the windows upon which the sun is. Like scattered dust, that is, like it in its lack of benefit, since there is no reward for it due to the lack of a condition, and they will be punished for it in this world.

“The companions of Paradise, that Day,” the Day of Resurrection, “will be better in settlement,” than the disbelievers in this world, “and better in rest,” than them, that is, a place where they rest in it, which is a midday rest in the heat, and from that is taken the end of the reckoning in midday, as mentioned in the hadith.

“And the Day the heaven will split open,” that is, every heaven, “with clouds,” that is, with it, which are white clouds, “and the angels will descend,” from every heaven, “a descent,” that is, the Day of Resurrection, and its accusative is with “remembrance,” implied. In a reading with a shaddah on the shin, “shake” is by assimilating the second ta’ in the original, and in another, “we will send down” with two nuns, the second silent, and the damma on the lam, and the accusative of the angels.

“The sovereignty, that Day, is the truth for the Most Merciful,” no one will share it with Him. “And it will be,” the Day, “a difficult day for the disbelievers,” unlike the believers.

“And the Day the wrongdoer will bite,” the polytheist Uqbah ibn Abi Mu’ayt, who had uttered the two testimonies of faith, then returned to please Abu ibn Khalaf, “at his hands,” in regret and sorrow on the Day of Resurrection. ""He says, 'Oh, would that I had taken with the Messenger, Muhammad, a path, a way to guidance.

'He has led me astray from the remembrance,' meaning the Qur'an, 'after it had come to me,' by turning me away from believing in it.

So they went to them with the message but they denied them. “And We destroyed them with [complete] destruction.” “And” mention “the people of Noah, when they denied the messengers” by denying Noah because of his long stay among them, so it was as if he were messengers, or because denying him was denying the rest of the messengers because they shared in bringing monotheism. “We drowned them” the answer to “and made them for the people” after them “a sign” a lesson. “And We have prepared” in the Hereafter “for the wrongdoers” the disbelievers “a painful punishment” painful, other than what will happen to them in this world. “And” mention “‘Aad” the day of Hud “and Thamud” the people of Salih “and the companions of the message” the name of a well and their prophet, it was said Shu’aib, and it was said someone else. They were sitting around it, so it collapsed on them and their homes. «And Our generations» people «between that, many» that is, between ‘Ad and the people of al-Rass. «And for each We presented examples» in establishing the proof against them, so We did not destroy them except after the warning «and each We destroyed with utter destruction» We destroyed with utter destruction because they denied their prophets. «And they had certainly come» that is, the infidels of Mecca «upon the town which had been rained down with the rain of evil» the source of the word «sa’a» meaning with stones, and it was the largest town of the people of Lot, so God destroyed its people for their immoral act «Did they not see it» on their journey to Syria, so they would take heed, and the question is for confirmation «but they did not expect» they feared «a resurrection» a resurrection, so they did not believe.

He said, “Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them,” meaning the Creator of that, “if you are certain,” that He is its Creator, then believe in Him alone.

Pharaoh said, “to those around him,” from the nobles of his people, “Do you not listen?” His answer, which did not match the question.

Moses said, “Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of old,” even though this was included in what preceded it, angered Pharaoh, and for that reason.

Moses said, “Lord of the East and the West and whatever is between them, if you would but use reason,” that is, so believe in Him alone.

j-0744	Remember, “When Moses said to his family,” his wife, when he was on his way from Midian to Egypt, “Indeed, I have perceived,” saw from afar, “a fire. I will bring you information from it,” about the condition of the road, and he had lost it, “or I will bring you a burning flame,” in addition to the statement, meaning a flame at the top of a wick or stick, “that you may warm yourselves.” The ta’ is a substitute for the ta’ of the ifti’al from the verb salā bi-an-nar with a kasra or fatha on the lam, “that you may warm yourselves from the cold.” “So when he came to it, he was called, ‘Blessed is he who is in the fire,’ meaning Moses, “and those around it,” meaning the angels or vice versa. Blessed is transitive by itself and by the letter, and is understood as after in place of “and glory be to God, Lord of the worlds,” among what was called, and its meaning is to exonerate God from evil. “O Moses, indeed,” meaning the matter, “I am God, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.” “And throw down your staff,” so he threw it. “But when he saw it writhing,” moving, “as if it were a serpent,” a light snake, “he turned away in flight and did not look back,” God Almighty said, “O Moses, do not return.” Fear it, for the messengers do not fear in My presence, from a snake or anything else. Except for him who wrongs himself and then changes it to good after evil, that is, repents. I am Forgiving and Merciful. I accept his repentance and forgive him. And put your hand into your bosom, the collar of your shirt. It will come out, unlike its color from the skin, white without disease, leprosy with a ray that blinds the sight, a sign, with nine signs, sent with it, to Pharaoh and his people. Indeed, they were a people of evildoers. But when Our clear signs came to them, bright and clear, they said, “This is obvious magic.” Clear and apparent. And they denied them, they did not acknowledge them, although their souls were convinced of them, that is, they were certain that they were from God, “in injustice and arrogance.” They were too proud to believe in what Moses brought, referring back to denial. “Then see,” O Muhammad, “how was the end of the corrupters,” which you know of their destruction.

""And Solomon inherited David"" prophethood and knowledge without the rest of his sons ""and said, 'O mankind, we have been taught the language of birds'"" that is, understanding their sounds ""and we have been given of all things' that is given to prophets and kings ""indeed this' what was given 'is manifest bounty'"" clear and apparent. ""And he gathered"" he gathered ""for Solomon his soldiers of jinn, mankind and birds"" in a march of his ""and they were distributed"" they were gathered and then driven ""until, when they came upon the Valley of the Ants"" that is in Taif or in Ash-Sham, ants, small or large ""an ant"" the queen of the ants said when she saw Solomon's soldiers ""O ants, enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his soldiers crush you"" break you while they perceive not"" the ants were placed in the position of rational beings in the discourse In their speech

“So Solomon smiled” beginning “laughing” ending “at her words” and he heard it from three miles away, the wind carried it to him, so he held back his soldiers when he overlooked their valley until they entered their homes, and his soldiers were riding and walking in this march “and he said, ‘My Lord, inspire me’ inspire me “to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed” upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve and admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants’” Prophets and Saints"

""I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of God, and Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and has averted them from the way"" the way of truth ""so they are not guided""
""that they should not prostrate to God"" that is, that they should prostrate to Him, so La was added and the nun of An was assimilated into it as in the Almighty's saying so that the People of the Book would not know and the sentence is in the place of the object of they are guided by dropping to ""who brings forth the hidden"" a source meaning the hidden from rain and plants ""in the heavens and the earth and knows what They conceal in their hearts and do not declare with their tongues. “Allah, there is no god but He, Lord of the Mighty Throne.” A resumption of a sentence of praise that includes the Throne of the Most Gracious in contrast to the Throne of Bilqis, and there is a great distance between them. “He said” Solomon to the hoopoe, “We will see whether you have told the truth” in what she told us, “or whether you are among the liars” meaning of this type, which is more eloquent than whether you lied in it. Then he showed them the water, so it was extracted and they quenched their thirst and performed ablution and prayed. Then Solomon wrote a letter, the image of which is from the servant of Allah, Solomon, son of Dawud, to Bilqis, Queen of Sheba, “In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Peace be upon those who follow guidance. As for what follows, do not exalt yourselves over me, but come to me in submission.” Then he sealed it with musk and sealed it with his seal. Then he said to the hoopoe, “Go with this letter of mine and throw it to them,” meaning Bilqis and her people. “Then turn away” he turned away “from them” he stood close to them “and see what answer they return.” So he took it and came to her, and her soldiers surrounded her and threw it in her lap. When she saw it, she trembled and submitted in fear. Then she stood on what was in it."
j-0747	Then she said to the nobles of her people, “O chiefs, indeed a noble letter has been delivered to me,” sealed, “that it is from Solomon, and that it is,” that is, its content, “in the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful,” “that you not exalt yourselves above me, but come to me in submission.” She said, “O chiefs, advise me,” with the two hamzas pronounced and the second simplified by changing it to a waw, that is, advise me “in my affair. I have not decided a matter” decided it “until you witness” attend. They said, “We are men of strength and of great might,” that is, men of strength in war, “and the command is yours, so consider what you command,” that is, men of strength in war. “She said, ‘Indeed, when kings enter a city, they corrupt it’ by destroying it, “and make the most honorable of its people the humbled. And thus do they do,’ that is, the senders of the letter. “And indeed, I am sending to them a gift, so I will see how the messengers return,” whether by accepting the gift or rejecting it, if it was a king who accepted it or a prophet who did not accept it. So she sent a thousand male and female servants equally, and five hundred bricks of gold, and a crown crowned with jewels, and musk and amber, and other things, with a messenger with a letter. The hoopoe hurried to Solomon to tell him the news, so he ordered that bricks of gold and silver be struck, and that a field be spread out from its place to nine leagues, and that a lofty wall of gold and silver be built around it, and that the best beasts of land and sea be brought, along with the children of the jinn, to the right and left of the field. “So when he came,” the messenger with the gift and his followers, “Solomon said, ‘Do you provide me with wealth? What God has given me is better than what He has given you,’ of this world. ‘Rather, you rejoice in your gift,’ because of your pride in the adornments of this world. ‘Return to them,’ with what you have brought as a gift, ‘and we will come to them with soldiers they cannot resist, and we will drive them out of it,’ from the land of Sheba, which was named after the father of their tribe, ‘humiliated and debased,’ if they do not come to me as Muslims. So when the messenger returned to her with the gift, she made her bed inside seven doors inside her palace. She confined her palace to seven palaces, closed the doors, put guards on them, and prepared to go to Solomon to see what he would order her to do. She set out with twelve thousand qayls, with each qayl many thousands more, until she approached him at a distance of a farsakh that he could feel.
j-0748	"""He said, 'O chiefs! Which of you'"" in the two hamzas is what came before ""will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission"", obedient and submissive, so I have to take it before that, not after it. ""An 'Ifrit from the jinn"" said, ""I will bring it to you before you rise from your seat"" in which you sit for judgment, which is from morning until noon. ""And indeed, I am strong for it"", that is, for carrying it. ""And trustworthy"" for what is in it of jewels and other things. Solomon said, ""I want faster than that."" ""He who had knowledge of the Book"" said, ""The One who had knowledge of the Book"", the Revealed, and he was Asif bin Barkhiya, a friend who knew the Greatest Name of God, which if he called upon it, it would be answered. ""I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you"", if you look at something with it, so he said to him, ""Look at the sky."" So he looked at it, then he turned his glance and found it placed before him. In his looking at the sky, Asif called upon the Greatest Name to bring it to God, and it happened that it flowed under the earth until it sprang up under Solomon's throne. ""And when he saw it settled"", still, ""near him, he said, ""This"", that is, bringing it to me ""is from the bounty of my Lord, that He may test me."" To test me, “Should I be grateful?” by realizing the two hamzas and replacing the second with an alif and making it easier and inserting an alif between the other one and leaving it, “or ungrateful” for the blessing. “And whoever is grateful, he is grateful for himself” that is, for it because the reward for his gratitude is for him. “And whoever is ungrateful” for the blessing “then indeed, my Lord is free” from his gratitude “and generous” in bestowing favors on whoever is ungrateful for it. “He said, ‘Disguise her throne for her’” that is, change it to a state that she would not recognize when she sees it “let us see whether she will be guided” to knowing it “or will she be among those who are not guided” to knowing what is changed for them. He intended by that to test her mind because it was said that there was something in it, so they changed it by adding or subtracting or other than that. “So when she came, it was said” to her, “Is this your throne?” that is, is this like your throne? “She said, ‘As if it were it’” so she recognized it and made it seem like it to them as they made it seem like it to her because he did not say, “Is this your throne?” If it had been said, “This,” she would have said, “Yes.” Solomon said when he saw her knowledge and science “And we were given knowledge before her, and we were Muslims.” “And what she used to worship besides God turned her away” that is, from the worship of God “that which she used to worship besides God” that is, ""She was from a disbelieving people."" ""It was said to her,"" also, ""Enter the palace,"" which is a surface of transparent white glass beneath which was fresh, flowing water in which were fish that Solomon had made when he was told that her legs and feet were like those of a donkey. ""But when she saw it, she thought it was a deep sea,"" of water, ""and she uncovered her legs,"" to wade through it. Solomon was on his bed in the front of the palace, and he saw her legs and feet were beautiful. ""He said,"" to her, ""It is a palace smooth,"" smoothed, ""of glass,"" of glass, and he called her to Islam. ""She said, 'My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself,' by worshipping other than You, ""and I have submitted,' being, 'with Solomon to God, Lord of the worlds.'"" He wanted to marry her, but he disliked the hair on her legs, so the devils made him a lamp and removed it with it, so he married her and loved her and confirmed her in her kingdom. He used to visit her once a month and stay with her for three days, and her kingdom ended with the end of Solomon's kingdom. It was narrated that he became king when he was thirteen years old and died when he was fifty-three years old. So glory be to He whose kingdom has no end in perpetuity."

But most of them do not know.” His Oneness. “Is there one who responds to the distressed one when he calls upon Him and removes the evil from him and from others and makes you successors on the earth?” The addition means in which each generation succeeds the previous generation. “Is there a god with God? Little do you remember?” You are admonished by the upper and lower letters, in which the ta’ is assimilated into the dhal, and ma is redundant to reduce the little. “Is there one who guides you?” “In the darkness of the land and the sea?” “And who sends the winds as heralds before His mercy?” “Is there a god with God? Exalted is God above what they associate with Him.” “Is there one who begins creation?” in the wombs from a drop of semen, “then repeats it” after death, even though you do not acknowledge the repetition because of the evidence for it. “And who provides for you from the sky” with rain “and the earth” with plants. “Is there a god with God?” That is, none does anything of what was mentioned except God, and there is no god with Him. «Say» O Muhammad «Bring forth your proof» your argument «if you are truthful» that with me is a god who did something of what was mentioned and they asked him about the time of the Hour, so he came down «Say: None in the heavens and the earth knows» of the angels and the people «the unseen» that is, what is hidden from them «except» but «Allah» knows it «and they do not perceive» that is, the infidels of Mecca like others «when» the time «they will be resurrected». «Rather» means did «Adrak» the weight of akram and in another reading it is idrak with a shaddah on the dal and its original is tadrak, the ta was replaced with a dal and was assimilated into the dal and the hamzat al-wasl was brought in, meaning it reached and caught up or followed up and continued «their knowledge in the Hereafter» that is, about it until they asked about the time of its coming, which is not the case «Rather, they are in doubt about it, rather, they are blind to it» from blindness of the heart, which is more eloquent than what preceded it, and the original is blind, the damma on the ya was made too heavy so it was transferred to the mim after deleting its kasra
j-0752	"""And those who disbelieved said,"" also in denying the resurrection, ""When we are dust, and our fathers, shall we indeed be brought forth?"" from the graves. ""We were promised this, we and our fathers before. This is nothing but legends of the ancients."" The plural of legend with the dammah, meaning what was written of lies. ""Say, 'Travel through the land and see how was the end of the criminals.'"" in their denial, which is their destruction by punishment. ""And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they plot."" Consoling the Prophet, meaning do not worry about their plotting against you, for We will support you against them. ""And they say, 'When will this promise be?' if you should be truthful?"" in it. ""Say, 'Perhaps there will be a resumption,' near, 'for you some of what you are hastening.'"" So they were killed at Badr, and the rest of the punishment will come to them after death. ""And indeed, your Lord is full of bounty to mankind."" This includes delaying the punishment for the disbelievers. ""But most of them are not grateful."" So the disbelievers are not grateful for delaying the punishment because they deny that it will happen. ""And indeed, your Lord knows what their hearts conceal."" They conceal it. “And they do not declare” with their tongues “and there is nothing hidden in the heavens and the earth” the “ha” is for emphasis, meaning something that is extremely hidden from people “except that it is in a clear book” clear, which is the Preserved Tablet and the hidden knowledge of God Almighty, including the punishment of the infidels."
j-0753	“Indeed, this Qur’an relates to the Children of Israel” who were present at the time of our Prophet “most of that over which they differ” that is, by explaining what was mentioned in a way that would remove the differences between them if they had taken it and submitted. “And indeed, it is guidance” from misguidance “and a mercy to the believers” from punishment. “Indeed, your Lord will judge between them” like others on the Day of Resurrection “with His judgment” that is, His justice. “And He is the Exalted in Might” the Prevailing “the Knowing” of what He judges, so no one can disobey Him as the disbelievers disobeyed His prophets in this world.
j-0754	"""So rely upon Allah"" trust in Him ""for you are upon the clear truth"" the clear religion, so the outcome for you is victory over the infidels. Then he gave examples for them with the dead, the deaf, and the blind, saying: ""You cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when"" by making the two hamzas clear and facilitating the second between it and the ya' ""and you cannot guide the blind from their error. You cannot make hear"" a hearing of understanding and acceptance ""except those who believe in Our verses"" the Qur'an ""and they are Muslims"" sincere in the oneness of Allah."
j-0755	"“And when the word comes to pass against them,” the right punishment is to befall them among the disbelievers, “We will bring forth for them a beast from the earth that will speak to them,” that is, it will speak to those present when it emerges in Arabic, saying to them among its speech on behalf of Us. “The people,” the disbelievers of Mecca, and according to the reading of the opening of the hamza of “in,” the ba’ is estimated after their speech, “were not certain of Our signs,” they did not believe in the Qur’an, which includes resurrection, accountability, and punishment. With its emergence, the command to do good and the prohibition of evil will be cut off, and no disbeliever will believe, as God revealed to Noah that none of your people will believe except those who have already believed. “And,” mention, “the Day We shall gather from every nation a company,” a group, “of those who deny Our signs,” and they are their leaders who are followed. “They will be driven,” that is, they will be gathered together, returning the last of them to the first of them, then they will be driven. “Until, when they come,” the place of accountability, “He will say,” the Most High, to them, “Did you deny,” My prophets, “My signs and you did not encompass them in knowledge,” from the aspect of your denial, “of them?” As for,” in which there is an assimilation of the interrogative “that,” a relative pronoun, meaning What “you were doing” of what you were commanded to do

“And the word” of punishment has come upon them because of their wrongdoing” that is, they associated others with Allah “so they do not speak” since they have no argument

“Have they not seen that We have made” We created “the night for them to rest therein” like others “and the day to see” meaning that it sees in it so that they can act therein “Indeed in that are signs” indications of His Almighty power “for a people who believe” they are specifically mentioned because they benefit from it in their belief unlike the disbelievers

“And on the Day the Trumpet is blown” the first blast from Israfil “then whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth will be terrified” they feared the fear that leads to death as in another verse, “so they will be struck dead” and the expression in it is in the past tense because it is certain that it will happen “except whom Allah wills” that is, Gabriel, Michael, Israfil and the Angel of Death, and according to Ibn Abbas they are the martyrs since they are alive with their Lord and are provided for “and all” its tanween is a substitute for the complement i.e. all of them after they are revived on the Day of Resurrection “will come to Him” in the form of a verb and an active participle ""Dakhreen"" subdued, and the expression in bringing the past tense to confirm its occurrence. ""And you will see the mountains"" you will see them at the time of the blast ""you will think them"" you will think them ""solid"" standing in place because of their size ""and they will pass like the passing of clouds"" rain when the wind strikes it, that is, they will move like it until they fall on the ground and spread it out, then it will become like wool, then it will become scattered dust ""The creation of God"" is a source confirming the content of the sentence before it, its subject was added after its agent was deleted, that is, God's creation is that creation ""who perfected"" perfected ""everything"" His creation ""He is All-Aware of what they do"" with the letter ya and the letter ta, that is, His enemies in disobedience and His allies in obedience"
j-0756	"“Whoever brings good” meaning there is no god but Allah on the Day of Resurrection “will have better” reward “than it” meaning because of it and not for preference since there is no better deed than it. In another verse, ten times the like. “And they” those who bring it “are safe from the terror of that Day” with addition and kasra and fatha of the meem and terror with munun and fatha of the meem “and whoever brings evil” meaning polytheism “will have their faces thrown into the Fire” by making it a guardian and mentioning the faces because they are the place of honor among the senses, so other than them are more appropriate. And it will be said to them as a rebuke “Will you” what “be recompensed except” the recompense “for what you used to do” of polytheism and sins? Say to them “I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city” meaning Mecca “Who has made it a safe sanctuary where no human blood is shed, no one is wronged therein, its game is hunted and its people are not secluded.” This is one of the blessings upon the Quraysh, its people, in that Allah has lifted from their city the torment and tribulations that are prevalent in all the lands of the Arabs. “And to Him” the Most High “is all things” so He is its Lord, Creator and Owner. “And I have been commanded to be of the Muslims” to God through His Oneness

“And to recite the Qur’an” to you, the recitation of the call to faith “So whoever is guided” to it “is only guided for [the benefit of] himself” that is, for his sake, for the reward of his guidance is for him “And whoever goes astray” from faith and misses the path of guidance “then say” to him “I am only of the warners” those who frighten, so I have nothing to do except convey the message, and this is before the command to fight

“And say, ‘Praise be to God. He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them’” So God showed them on the day of Badr the killing and captivity and the angels striking their faces and backs and God hastened them to the Fire “And your Lord is not unaware of what they do” with the letter ya and the letter ta, but He only gives them respite until their time"

""And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders"" by realizing the two hamzas and replacing the second with a yaa' to be followed in goodness ""and make them inheritors"" the kingdom of Pharaoh.
""And establish them in the land"" the land of Egypt and Syria ""and show Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers"" and in Reading and seeing with the opening of the lower and the ra’ ​​and raising the three names “among them is what they were afraid of” they fear the newborn who will take away their kingdom at his hands"

""Then the family"" of ""Pharaoh"" picked him up in the coffin in the morning, ""and they"" - the helpers of ""Pharaoh"" - placed him in front of him and opened it and took Moses out of it while he was sucking milk from his thumb ""that he may be for them"" in the end ""an enemy"" - killing their men ""and a cause of grief"" - enslaving their women. In a reading with a damma on the ha' and a sukoon on the zay, there are two dialects for the source, and here it means the active participle of ""Hazanahu"" as in ""Azhanahu"" - ""Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman"" - his minister ""and their soldiers were sinners"" from sin, i.e. disobedient, so they were punished for it. His hands

“And the wife of Pharaoh said,” when they and his supporters were about to kill him, “A comfort to the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us or we may adopt him as a son,” so they obeyed her, “while they did not perceive,” of the consequences of their affair with him.

“And the heart of Moses’ mother became empty,” when she learned that he had been taken, “of everything else.” “Indeed,” a lightened form of the heavy form, and its subject is omitted, meaning that she “almost disclosed him,” meaning that he was her son, “had We not strengthened her heart,” with patience, meaning that it had calmed it, “so that she might be among the believers,” those who believed in God’s promise. The answer to “had it not been” is indicated by what preceded it.

“And she said to his sister,” Mary, “Follow him,” follow his trail until you learn news of him. “So she saw him,” she saw him, “from a distance,” from a distant place, stealthily, “and they did not perceive,” that she was his sister and that she was watching him.

“And We had forbidden him wet nurses before,” that is, before returning him to his mother, that is, we prevented him from accepting the breast of a wet nurse other than his mother, so he did not accept the breast of any of the wet nurses prepared for him. “Then she said,” his sister “Shall I direct you to a household” when she saw their tenderness towards him “who will take care of him for you” by breastfeeding and other things “and are sincere to him” and the pronoun for him was interpreted as the king in response to them, so she was answered and brought his mother and he kissed her breast and she responded to them about his acceptance by saying that she had a pleasant scent and good milk, so he gave her permission to breastfeed him in her house, so she returned with him as God Almighty said: “So We restored him to his mother that her eye might be refreshed” by meeting him “and she would not grieve” then “and that she might know that the promise of God” to return him to her “is true, but most of them” meaning the people “do not know” of this promise or that this is his sister and this is his mother, so he stayed with her until she weaned him and he gave her a wage of one dinar per day and she took it because it was war property, so she brought him to Pharaoh and he was raised with him as God Almighty said, narrating about him in Surat Ash-Shu’ara: “Did We not raise you among us as a child, and you remained among us for years of your life?”"
j-0759	"“And when he reached his full strength,” which was thirty or three years, “and was established,” that is, he reached forty years, “We gave him judgment,” wisdom, “and knowledge,” understanding of the religion before he was sent as a prophet. “And thus,” as We rewarded him, “We reward the doers of good,” to themselves. “And he entered,” Moses, “the city,” the city of Pharaoh, which was Memphis, after he had been absent from him for a period, “at a time when its people were not paying attention,” at the time of the siesta, “and he found therein two men fighting, one of his party,” that is, an Israelite, “and the other of his enemy,” that is, a Copt who was enticing an Israelite to carry firewood to Pharaoh’s kitchen. “And the one of his party called upon him for help against the one of his enemy,” Moses said to him, “Leave him alone.” It was said that he said to Moses, “I was about to make him attack you.” “But Moses struck him,” that is, struck him with the palm of his hand, and he was very strong and violent. “And he finished him off,” he killed him, but he did not intend to kill him and bury him in the sand. “He said,” he killed him, “is from the work of Satan,” the one who incites my anger. “He is an enemy,” to the son of Adam.

""He said, ""My Lord, because You have bestowed favor"" by virtue of Your favor ""upon me"" by forgiveness, protect me ""I will never be a supporter"" a helper ""for the criminals"" the disbelievers after this if You protect me

""So he came into the city fearful and waiting"" waiting for what he would get from the people of the slain man ""Then behold, he who had sought his aid the day before cried out to him"" seeking his help against another Copt ""Moses said to him, ""Indeed, you are clearly a heretic"" between misguidance for what you did yesterday and today

You only want to be a tyrant in The land and what you want to be among the reformers.” The Copt heard that and knew that the killer was Moses, so he went to Pharaoh and told him about that. Pharaoh ordered the butchers to kill Moses, so they took him on the way to him."
j-0760	“And a man came,” he was the believer of Pharaoh’s people, “from the farthest part of the city,” its end, “running,” he walked quickly, by a path closer than theirs. “He said, ‘O Moses, indeed the chiefs’ of Pharaoh’s people, “are conferring over you,” consulting about you, “to kill you, so get out,” from the city, “I am indeed among your sincere advisers,” in the matter of the matter of the get out. “So he went out from it, fearful and waiting,” for the pursuit of a seeker or for God’s help to come to him. “He said, ‘My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people,’” the people of Pharaoh.
j-0761	"""And when he turned his face toward Madyan,"" its direction was the village of Shu'ayb, eight days' journey from Egypt, named after Madyan, son of Abraham, and he did not know its route. ""He said, 'Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right way.'"" That is, he intended the middle way to it, so God sent an angel with a goat in his hand, and he set off with him toward it. ""And when he came to the water of Madyan,"" a well in it, that is, he reached it, ""he found there a group of people watering their flocks, and he found besides them, other than them, two women holding back,"" preventing their sheep from the water. ""He said,"" Moses to them, ""What is the matter with you?"" ""What is the matter with you that you do not water?"" ""They said, 'We do not water until the shepherds depart,'"" the plural of shepherd, that is, they return from their watering places for fear of crowding, so we water. In another reading, it is from the quadriliteral, meaning they turn their livestock away from the water. ""And our father is an old man,"" unable to water. ""So he watered for them,"" from another well near them, lifting a stone from it that only ten people could lift. ""Then he turned,"" he turned away, ""to the shade,"" to be tanned from the intense heat of the sun, and he Hungry, “He said, ‘My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You send down to me, poor,’” food, needy. So they returned to their father in less time than they used to return, so he asked them about that, and they told him who had watered for them. He said to one of them, “Call him for me.” God Almighty said, “Then one of them came to him, walking shyly,” meaning, putting the sleeve of her armor over her face out of shyness before him. “She said, ‘Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.’” So he answered her, denying in himself that he had taken the wages, as if she intended to be rewarded if he was one of those who wanted them. So she walked in front of him, and the wind began to blow her garment, exposing her legs. He said to her, “Walk behind me and show me the way.” So she did until her father came, and he was Shu’ayb, peace be upon him, and he had dinner. He said, “Sit down and eat.” He said, “I fear that it will be in exchange for what I have watered for them, and we are a family who do not ask for compensation for a good deed.” He said, “No, it is my custom and the custom of my fathers to welcome guests and feed food.” So he ate and told him his situation. God Almighty said, “So when he came to him and related to him the story.” A source meaning the related from The Copt killed him and they intended to kill him and he feared Pharaoh. ""He said, 'Do not fear. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people.'"" For Pharaoh had no power over Midian. ""One of the two said, 'O my father, hire him.'"" He hired him as a worker to tend our sheep instead of us. ""The best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy."" That is, he hired him for his strength and trustworthiness. So he asked her about him and she told him what had happened before, of him raising the stone of the well and of him saying to her, ""Walk behind me."" And in addition, when she came to him and he knew about her, he lowered his head but did not raise it, so he desired to marry him. ""He said, 'I want to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine.'"" That is, the older or younger, ""on condition that you hire me."" She will be my worker in tending my sheep. ""For eight years."" ""But if you complete ten years,"" that is, ten years of tending, ""it will be from you.""

So the contract was completed with that and Shu’ayb ordered his daughter to give Moses a staff with which to repel the wild beasts from his sheep, and the staffs of the prophets were with him, so Adam’s staff from the myrtle of Paradise fell into her hand, so Moses took it with Shu’ayb’s knowledge."

“And he and his soldiers were arrogant in the land,” the land of Egypt, “without right.” And they thought that they would not return to Us. So We seized him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea. Then see how was the end of the wrongdoers. When they were destroyed, We made them leaders in this world. They call to the Fire. And on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped. And We pursued them in this world with a curse. And on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the despised. And We gave Moses the Scripture after We had destroyed the former generations. The people of Noah, Aad, Thamud, and others. As insights for the people. A state of the Book, the plural of insight, which is the light of the heart, meaning lights for the hearts. And guidance from misguidance for those who act upon it.

The preposition “ba” is for transitivity, and their number was said to be seventy, and it was said to be forty, and it was said to be ten, and something else was said. Remember, “when his people said to him,” the believers from the Children of Israel, “Do not rejoice,” with great wealth, with the joy of pride, “for God does not love those who exult,” with that. “And seek,” seek, “with that which God has given you,” of wealth, “the home of the Hereafter,” by spending it in obedience to God, “and do not forget,” leave, “your share of this world,” meaning that you work in it for the sake of the Hereafter. “And do good,” to the people with charity, “as God has done good to you, and do not seek,” seek, “corruption in the land,” by committing sins. “For God does not love corrupters,” meaning that He punishes them. “He said, ‘I have only been given it,’ meaning the wealth, “because of knowledge I have,” meaning in return for it, and He was more knowledgeable.” The Children of Israel with the Torah after Moses and Aaron.

j-0774	"{Alif, Lam, Meem} God knows best what He means by that

“Do people think that they will be left to say” that is, by their saying “We believe and they will not be tested” that is, tested with what will reveal the truth of their faith? It was revealed about a group who believed and the polytheists harmed them

“And We have certainly tested those before them - so Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful” in their faith with visible knowledge “and He will surely make evident the liars” in it

“Or do those who do evil deeds” polytheism and transgressions “think that they will outpace Us” that they will escape Us so that We will not take revenge on them? “Evil” how bad “is that” that “they judge” is this judgment of theirs

“Whoever hopes” fears “the meeting with Allah - then indeed, the term of Allah” with Him “is coming” so let him prepare for it “And He is the Hearer” of the words of the servants “The Knower” of their actions

“And whoever strives” in war or self “strives only for himself” for the benefit of his striving is for him, not for Allah “Indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds” mankind, jinn, and angels and their worship

“And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely remove from them their [misdeeds]” Their evil deeds” by doing good deeds “and We will surely reward them with what is better” meaning good and its accusative is by removing the preposition “ba” “which they used to do” which is good deeds"

j-0776	“And among the people is he who says, ‘We believe in Allah,’ but when he is harmed for the sake of Allah, he considers the trial of the people to be like the punishment of Allah” in fear of Him, so he obeys them and becomes a hypocrite. “And if” the lam of an oath “there comes” to the believers “from your Lord” and they gain spoils, “they will surely say” the nun of the nominative case was deleted due to the succession of the nuns and the waw is a plural pronoun due to the meeting of two quiescent letters “Indeed, we were with you” in faith, so they shared in the spoils. God Almighty said, “Is not God more knowing” that is, more knowledgeable “of what is in the breasts of the worlds” in their hearts of faith and hypocrisy? Yes. “And God will surely make evident those who believe” in their hearts “and He will surely make evident the hypocrites” so He will punish both groups. The lam in both verbs is a lam of an oath. “And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, ‘Follow our way’” our religion “and we will bear your sins” in following us if it is, and the imperative is in the sense of a news. God Almighty said, “And they will not bear any of their sins. Indeed, they are liars” in that. “And they will bear their burdens, their sins and burdens with Their burdens are due to their saying to the believers, “Follow our way,” and their misleading of their imitators. And they will be asked on the Day of Resurrection about what they used to invent. They lied about God, a question of rebuke. The lam in the two verbs is a lam of an oath, and their subject is omitted, the waw and the nun of the subject are omitted.

j-0780	God Almighty said in the story of Abraham, peace be upon him: “The answer of his people was only that they said, ‘Kill him or burn him.’ But God saved him from the Fire,” into which they had thrown him by making it cool and safe. “Indeed in that,” that is, saving him from it, “are signs,” namely that it did not affect him despite its greatness, and extinguished it, and created a garden in its place in a short time, “for a people who believe,” who believe in the Oneness of God and His power, because they are the ones who benefit from it. “And he said,” Abraham, “You have only taken idols besides God,” you worship them, and “what” is a source, “affection between yourselves,” the predicate of “in,” and in the accusative reading, it is the object for it, and “what” is the entire meaning, you have loved each other for their worship, “in the life of this world. Then on the Day of Resurrection some of you will disbelieve in others,” the leaders will disown the followers, “and you will curse one another,” the followers will curse the leaders, “and your refuge,” the destination of all of you, “is the Fire, and you will have no helpers,” to protect you from it. “So Lot believed in him,” Abraham believed, and he was his nephew Haran, “and he said,” Abraham, “Indeed, I am emigrating,” from my people, “to my Lord,” to where My Lord commanded me and he left his people and migrated from the blackness of Iraq to the Levant. “He is the Exalted in Might” in his kingdom, “the Wise” in his creation. “And We bestowed upon him” after Ishmael, “Isaac and Jacob” after Isaac, “and We placed in his descendants prophethood” so all the prophets after Abraham were from his descendants, “and the Scripture” meaning the books, that is, the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms, and the Criterion. “And We gave him his reward in this world” which is the good praise in all the people of religions. “And indeed, in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous” who have the highest ranks.

Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing,” legally, that is, its function as long as a person is in it. “And the remembrance of God is greater,” than other acts of obedience, “and God knows what you do,” so He will reward you for it.

And none rejects Our verses,” after they have been revealed, “except the disbelievers,” meaning the Jews, and it has become clear to them that the Qur’an is true and that the one who brought it is true, but they denied that.”

Say, “Sufficient is God between me and you as a witness. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth.” This includes my situation and your situation. “And those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in God are the losers.” In their deal, they bought disbelief for faith.

They rejoiced at that and knew about it on the day it occurred, meaning the day of Badr, when Gabriel descended with that, along with their joy at their victory over killing the polytheists in it. ""He gives victory to whom He wills, and He is All-Wise."" The Almighty, the Victorious, the Merciful to the believers. ""The promise of God"" is a source of action instead of the word, and the original is that God promised them victory. ""God does not fail in His promise"" to Him. ""But most of the people"" meaning the infidels of Mecca ""do not know"" His promise of their victory. ""They know only the outward appearance of the life of this world"" meaning its livelihoods, such as trade, agriculture, building, planting, and other things.

You fear them as you fear yourselves,” that is, your peers from the free, and the question is in the sense of negation, meaning that your slaves are not your partners, and so on, with you, so how do you make some of God’s slaves partners with Him? “Thus do We detail the verses,” we construct them in such detail, “for a people who understand.” “Rather, those who do wrong follow,” through polytheism, “their own desires without knowledge. So who will guide he whom God has led astray?” that is, there is no guide for him. “And they have no helpers,” who can prevent God’s punishment. “So set,” O Muhammad, “your face toward the religion, inclining toward it,” that is, make your religion sincere for God, you and those who follow you. “The nature of God,” His creation, “upon which He has created mankind,” which is His religion, that is, adhere to it. “There is no change in the creation of God.” To His religion, that is, do not change it by associating partners with Him. “That is the right religion,” the straight monotheism of God, “but most of the people,” that is, the infidels of Mecca, “do not know,” the monotheism of God. “Repenting,” returning, “to Him,” the Most High, in what He has commanded and forbidden, is a state of the subject of “establish,” and what is intended by it, that is, establish. “And fear Him,” fear Him, “and establish prayer, and be not of those who associate others with Him.” “Of those,” substituted by the return of the preposition, “who have divided their religion,” by their differences in what they worship, “and have become sects,” divisions in that, “each party,” of them, “rejoicing in what they have,” with what they have, “happy,” and in another reading, they departed, that is, they abandoned the religion that they were commanded to follow.

j-0797	«Say» to the infidels of Mecca «Travel through the land and observe how was the end of those before. Most of them were polytheists» so they were destroyed because of their polytheism and their dwellings and homes were empty. «So direct your face toward the right religion» the religion of Islam «before there comes a Day from Allah for which there is no repelling» that is the Day of Resurrection «On that Day they will be divided» in which there is an assimilation of the ta’ in the original into the sad, they will be dispersed after the reckoning to Paradise and Hell. «Whoever disbelieves, upon him is his disbelief» and the consequences of his disbelief, which is Hell. «And whoever does righteousness, they prepare for themselves» they prepare their homes in Paradise «that He may reward» related to «they will be divided «those who believe and do righteous deeds out of His bounty» He will reward them «for He does not like the disbelievers» that is, He will punish them.

And We had already sent before you messengers to their people, and they came to them with clear proofs” with clear arguments for their truthfulness in their message to them, but they denied them “and We took retribution from those who committed crimes” We destroyed those who denied them “and it was incumbent upon Us to support the believers” over the disbelievers by destroying them and saving the believers.

“It is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir up clouds” disturbing them “and spreads them in the sky as He wills” of little or much “and makes them fragments” with the opening of the seen or its sukoon, separate pieces “so you see the rain” rain “coming out from within it” meaning its middle “and when He strikes with it” with the rain “whoever He wills” Of His servants, when they rejoice, rejoice in the rain.

“And if” and “they were, before it was sent down upon them, in despair,” in confirmation, “of its sending down.”

“Then look at the trace,” and in the reading of traces, “of the mercy of Allah,” that is, His blessing with rain, “how He revives the earth after its death,” that is, its dryness by producing vegetation. “Indeed, that is the Resurrection of the dead, and He is over all things competent.”

“And if” the lam of an oath, “We sent a wind,” harmful to vegetation, “and they saw it yellow, they would continue,” they became the answer to the oath, “after it,” that is, after its yellowing, “to be ungrateful,” denying the blessing of rain.

“For indeed, you do not make the dead hear, nor do you make the deaf hear the call when,” by realizing the two hamzas and facilitating the second between it and the ya’, “they turn back, turning away.”

Indeed, the promise of God” of your victory over them “is true. And let not those who have no certainty” of the Resurrection impress you, that is, let them not lead you to be light-hearted and rash by abandoning patience, that is, do not abandon it."
j-0801	"""Alif, Lam, Meem"" Allah knows best what He means by it
""Those"" meaning these verses ""are the verses of the Book"" the Qur'an ""of wisdom"" and the addition means from
It is guidance and mercy in the nominative for the doers of good and in the general reading in the accusative case as a state of the verses in which the meaning of reference is in those
""Those who establish prayer"" is a statement for the doers of good ""and give zakat and they are certain of the Hereafter"" the second ""they"" is an emphasis

“And when Our verses are recited to him” that is, the Qur’an “he turns away arrogantly” haughtily “as if he had not heard them as if there was deafness in his ears” deafness and the two similes are two states of the pronoun of “turn away” or the second is an explanation of the first “so give him tidings” informing him “of a painful punishment” painful and mentioning the good news is mockery of him and he is Al-Nadr bin Al-Harith who used to come to Al-Hirah to trade and buy books of the news of the non-Arabs and tell them to the people of Mecca and say, “Muhammad tells you the stories of ‘Aad and Thamud and I tell you the stories of the Persians and the Romans” and they find his talk enjoyable and stop listening to the Qur’an

“Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds will have gardens of pleasure” “abiding therein” is an implied state, that is Destining their eternity in it if they enter it, “The promise of God is true,” meaning God promised them that, and His right is true. “And He is the Exalted in Might,” who is not overcome by anything that prevents Him from fulfilling His promise and threat, “the Wise,” who does not place anything except in its proper place."
j-0803	“He created the heavens without pillars that you can see” meaning pillars are the plural of ‘Imad, which is a column, and it is true that there are no pillars at all. “And He cast into the earth firm mountains” high mountains “so that” it does not “move” with you, and He dispersed therein every kind of creature, and We sent down” in this there is a shift from the third person “from the sky water and caused to grow therein every noble kind” good type. “This is the creation of God” meaning His creation. “So show me” tell me, O people of Mecca, “what those other than Him have created” other than Him meaning your gods so that you associate them with Him, the Most High. “Ma” is an interrogative of denial, a subject, and “that” in the sense of “that” is its predicate, and “show me” is suspended from the action, and what follows it fills the place of the two objects. “Rather” for the transition “the wrongdoers are in manifest error” explained by their association, and you are among them.
j-0804	“And We gave Luqman wisdom,” including knowledge, religion, and correct speech. His wisdom is well-known. He used to issue fatwas before the mission of David, but he lived to see his mission and took knowledge from him and stopped issuing fatwas. He said about that, “Should I not be satisfied if I am satisfied?” And he was asked, “Which of the people is worse?” He said, “The one who does not care if the people see him doing wrong.” “That,” that is, We said to him, “I should be grateful to God,” for what He gave you of wisdom. “And whoever is grateful is grateful for himself,” because the reward for his gratitude is for him. “And whoever is ungrateful,” for the blessing, “then indeed, God is free of need,” of His creation, “Praiseworthy,” praised in His creation. “And” remember, “when Luqman said to his son while he was admonishing him, “O my son,” diminutive of compassion, “Do not associate partners with God. Indeed, association” with God “is a great injustice,” so he returned to Him and became a Muslim.
j-0805	“And We have enjoined upon man, concerning his parents, his mother bore him, and grew weak, and his weaning is in two years, and We said to him, ‘Be grateful to Me and to your parents for the final destination. ’ But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompany them in this world with appropriate kindness, and follow the way of those who turn back to Me. Then to Me is your return, and I will inform you of what you used to do. ’ So I will reward you for it. The whole of the enjoinment and what follows it is an interjection.
j-0806	“O my son, if it be the weight of a mustard seed and be in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth,” that is, in the most hidden place, “Allah will bring it forth,” and He will hold you accountable for it. “Indeed, Allah is Kind,” of extracting it, “Aware,” of its location. “O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you,” because of the command and prohibition. “Indeed, that,” that is, the matters that are determined, which are determined because they are obligatory. “And turn not your cheek,” or in another reading, “upside down” “at people,” do not turn your face away from them in arrogance, “and do not walk through the earth exultantly,” that is, with conceit. “Indeed, Allah does not like any arrogant,” one who struts in his gait, “boasting,” toward people. “And be moderate in your pace,” be moderate between crawling and hastening, and be calm and dignified, “and lower,” lower, “of your voice. Indeed, the most disagreeable of sounds,” the ugliest of them, “is the voice of donkeys,” the beginning of which is a sigh and the end of which is a sob.
j-0807	“Have you not seen,” O you who are being addressed, “that God has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens,” of the sun, the moon, and the stars, so that you may benefit from them, “and whatever is on the earth,” of fruits, rivers, and animals, “and has bestowed upon you His favors,” both apparent and hidden, “and among the people,” meaning the people of Mecca, “is he who disputes about God without knowledge or guidance,” from a messenger, “or an enlightening book,” revealed by God, but rather by imitation. “And when it is said to them, ‘Follow what God has revealed,’ they say, ‘Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers,’” God Almighty said, “Would they follow it? Even if Satan were inviting them to the punishment of the Blaze,” meaning its causes, no. “And whoever submits his face to God,” meaning accepts His obedience, “while he is a doer of good,” a monotheist, “has grasped the firmest handhold,” the firmest end that he does not fear will break. “And to God is the outcome of all matters,” their return. “And whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you,” O Muhammad, “do not be concerned about his disbelief. To Us is their return.” Then We will inform them of what they did. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts, like others, so He will punish them for it. We will grant them enjoyment in this world for a little while, during their lives, then We will force them in the Hereafter to a severe punishment, which is the punishment of the Fire, from which they will find no escape. And if you ask them, who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely say, “Allah,” the nun of the subject was omitted due to the succession of similar letters and the waw of the pronoun due to the meeting of two quiescent letters. Say, “Praise be to Allah,” for the proof of monotheism was made clear to them. “But most of them do not know,” that it is obligatory upon them. “To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth,” in terms of ownership, creation, and servants, so no one else deserves to be worshipped in them except Him. Indeed, Allah is the Self-sufficient, the Praiseworthy, the Praised in His creation.
j-0808	“And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea were replenished thereafter by seven more seas” in ink “the words of God” expressed through it in writing His information with those pens and that ink, nor with more than that, because His information, the Most High, is infinite. “Indeed, God is Exalted in Might” nothing is beyond His power, “Wise” nothing is beyond His knowledge and wisdom. “He did not create you and resurrect you except as a single soul” in creation and resurrection, because with the word “Be” and it is. “Indeed, God is Hearing” He hears everything that is heard, “Seeing” He sees everything that is seen, nothing distracts Him from anything.
j-0809	«Have you not seen» you know, O addressee, «that God merges» He merges «the night into the day and merges the day» He merges «into the night» so that each of them increases what the other has diminished «and has subjected the sun and the moon, each» of them «running» in its orbit «to a specified term» which is the Day of Resurrection «and that God is Acquainted with what you do» «That» mentioned «is because God is the Truth» the established «and that what they invoke» with the letters ya and ta they worship «besides Him is falsehood» the vanishing «and that God is the Most High» over His creation by force «the Great» the Great? «Have you not seen that the ships» the ships «run through the sea by the grace of God that He may show you» O addressee with that «of His signs? Indeed in that are signs» an expression «for every patient» from disobeying God «grateful» for His grace. «And when waves cover them» that is, the disbelievers rise «like canopies» like mountains that shade from beneath them «they supplicate God, sincere to Him in religion» that is, supplication that He should save them, that is, they do not supplicate with Him other than Him «So when He saves them to Righteousness, among them is he who is moderate, who is in between faith and disbelief, and among them is he who remains in his disbelief. “And none rejects Our signs,” including salvation from the waves, “except every traitor, ungrateful,” for the blessings of God Almighty.
j-0810	“O mankind,” that is, the people of Mecca, “fear your Lord and fear a Day when no father will avail his son at all, nor will a son avail his father at all. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth.” In resurrection, “So let not the worldly life deceive you, and let not the Deceiver, the devil, deceive you about Allah,” in His patience and respite. Indeed, Allah has knowledge of the Hour, when it will come, and He sends down rain at a time that He knows. He knows what is in the wombs, whether male or female, and none of the three is known except Allah. And no soul knows what it will earn tomorrow, whether good or evil, while Allah knows it. And no soul knows in what land it will die, while Allah knows it. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things, Aware of its inner being as much as its outer being.” Al-Bukhari narrated on the authority of Ibn Umar the hadith of the keys to the unseen, five. Indeed, Allah has knowledge of the Hour, until the end of the surah.

j-0813	"""And they said,"" meaning the deniers of the resurrection, ""If we are lost in the earth,"" disappearing in it by becoming dust mixed with its dust, ""shall we then be in a new creation?"" A question of denial by making the two hamzas clear, facilitating the second, and inserting an alif between them in both places. God Almighty said, ""Rather, they are, in the meeting with their Lord,"" in the resurrection, ""disbelievers."" ""Say,"" to them, ""The Angel of Death who is assigned to you will take you,"" meaning he will take your souls, ""then to your Lord you will be returned,"" alive, so He will reward you for your deeds.

The answer to ""if you saw"" is a terrible matter. God Almighty said, ""And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance."" So she is guided by faith and obedience by her own choice. “But the word from Me will come true,” which is, “I will fill Hell with jinn and people all together.” The guards will say to them when they enter it: “So taste the punishment for having forgotten the meeting of this Day of yours.” That is, for having abandoned faith in it. “Indeed, We have forgotten you.” We have left you in the punishment. “And taste the punishment of eternity for what you used to do.”"
j-0814	“Only those who believe in Our verses” the Qur’an “are those who, when they are reminded” are admonished “by them, fall down in prostration and exalt” clothed in “the praise of their Lord” that is, they say, “Glory be to God and praise be to Him” “and they are not arrogant” about faith and obedience “their sides forsake their beds” the places where they lie down with their bedding for their night prayers, “to invoke their Lord in fear” of His punishment “and hope” for His mercy “and from what We have provided them they spend” they give in charity “so no soul knows what has been hidden” hidden “for them of comfort for their eyes” what their eyes will be comforted by. And in a reading with a silent ya’, it is a present tense verb “as a reward for what they used to do”
j-0815	"""Is he who is a believer like he who is a sinner? They are not equal."" That is, the believers and the sinners. ""As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them are the Gardens of Refuge as a lodging for what they used to do."" ""As for those who sinned,"" by disbelief and denial, ""their refuge is the Fire. Whenever they wish to leave it, they will be returned to it and it will be said to them, 'Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny.'"" ""And We will surely make them taste of the lesser punishment,"" the punishment of this world through killing, captivity, years of drought and disease, ""before"" before ""the greater punishment,"" the punishment of the Hereafter, ""perhaps they,"" that is, those who remain among them, ""will return,"" to faith. ""And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the verses of his Lord,"" the Qur'an, ""then turns away from them,"" that is, no one is more unjust than him. ""Indeed, We will take retribution from the criminals,"" the polytheists."
j-0816	“And We gave Moses the Book,” the Torah, “so be not in doubt,” of his meeting,” and they met on the night of the Isra’, “and We made it,” meaning Moses or the Book, “a guide,” a guide, “for the Children of Israel.” “And We made from among them leaders,” with the two hamzas pronounced and the second replaced by a ya’ of leaders, “guiding” the people “by Our command when they were patient,” in their religion and in the affliction of their enemy. In another reading, with the lam pronounced with a kasra and the mim pronounced with a light ya’, “and they were certain of Our signs,” indicating Our power and Our oneness, “that your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ,” of the matter of religion. “Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them?” That is, it becomes clear to the infidels of Mecca that We destroyed them “who walked,” a state of the pronoun for them, “in their dwellings,” in their travels to Syria and elsewhere, so they would consider. “Indeed in that are signs,” indications of Our power, “Do they not then hear?” Hearing of contemplation and admonition. “Or have they not seen that We We drive the water to the barren land, and bring forth thereby crops from which their livestock and themselves eat. Then will they not see?
j-0817	“And they say,” to the believers, “When will this conquest be,” between us and you, “if you should be truthful?” “Say, On the Day of Conquest,” by inflicting punishment upon them, “their faith will not benefit those who disbelieve, nor will they be reprieved,” they will be given respite for repentance or an excuse. “So turn away from them and wait,” for the punishment to be inflicted upon them, “for they are waiting,” for you to experience death or murder, so that they may be relieved of you. This was before the command to fight them.
j-0818	“O Prophet, fear God” remain devout in His fear “and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites” in what contradicts your law “for God is ever Knowing” of what will be before it comes into being “Wise” in what He creates “and follow what is revealed to you from your Lord” that is, the Qur’an “for God is ever, with what you do, Acquainted” and in another reading with the lower “and rely upon God” in your affair “and sufficient is God as Disposer of affairs” as a protector for you and his nation follows Him in all of that
j-0819	“God has not made for any man two hearts within him,” in response to those of the infidels who said that he had two hearts, each of which had a better mind than Muhammad’s mind. “And He has not made your wives, of whom you appear,” with a hamza and a ya’ and without a ya’, “your mothers,” without an alif before the ha’ and with it, and the second ta’ in the original is assimilated into the dha’, “your mothers,” that is, like mothers in forbidding them to do so, which was considered in the days of ignorance as divorce, but expiation is required for it based on its condition, as mentioned in Surat al-Mujadilah. “And He has not made your adopted sons,” the plural of da’i’, which is someone who claims to be his son, “your sons,” in reality. “That is your statement from your mouths,” that is, the Jews and the hypocrites said when the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, married Zaynab bint Jahsh, who was the wife of Zayd ibn Haritha, whom the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, adopted, that they said Muhammad married his son’s wife, so God Almighty denied them in that. “And God speaks the truth,” in that, “and He guides to the way,” the way of truth. But “call them by [the names of] their fathers; that is more just,” more equitable. “With Allah, if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brothers in religion and your allies,” your cousins. “And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred,” in that, “but” in “what your hearts intended,” in that, that is, after the prohibition. “And Allah is Forgiving,” for what you said before the prohibition, “and Merciful,” to you in that. “The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves,” in what he called them to and their selves called them to do otherwise. “And his wives are their mothers,” in the prohibition of marrying them. “And those of kinship,” those of blood relations, “are closer to one another” in inheritance “in the Book of Allah than the believers and the emigrants,” that is, from the inheritance by faith and emigration that was at the beginning of Islam and was abrogated. “Except,” but, “that you do to your relatives a kindness,” by a will, so it is permissible. “That,” that is, the abrogation of inheritance by faith and emigration was by the inheritance of those of kinship, “was written in the Book,” and what is meant by the Book in both places is the Preserved Tablet.
j-0820	“And” remember “when We took a covenant from the prophets” when they were brought forth from the loins of Adam like atoms, the plural of atom, which is the smallest ant, “and from you, and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, the son of Mary” to worship God and call to His worship. He mentioned the five as a link between the specific and the general. “And We took from them a firm covenant” strong to fulfill what they were charged with, which is an oath by God Almighty. Then He took the covenant “that He might question” God “the truthful about their truthfulness” in conveying the message, as a rebuke to those who disbelieved in them. “And He has prepared” God Almighty “for the disbelievers” in them “a painful punishment” painful, which is a link between Our taking.
j-0821	"“O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when there came upon you armies” of the infidels, grouped together during the days of digging the trench “and We sent upon them a wind and armies you did not see” of the angels “and Allah is ever, of what you do” with the ta’ of digging the trench and with the ya’ of grouping the polytheists “Seeing”
“when they came upon you from above you and from below you” from the top of the valley and its bottom from the east and the west “and when the eyes turned away” turned away from everything to their enemy from every side “and the hearts reached to the throats” the plural of hanjarah is the end of the throat from the intensity of fear “and you assumed about Allah various assumptions” of victory and battle
“there the believers were tried” they were tested to distinguish the sincere from the non-sincere “and were shaken” moved “with a severe earthquake” from the intensity of fear
“and” remember “when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease” weak belief “said: Allah and His Messenger have promised us” victory “nothing but that.” ""Delusion"" in vain. ""And when a party of them said"" meaning the hypocrites ""O people of Yathrib"" it is the land of Medina and it was not declined for the sake of knowledge and the weight of the verb ""There is no place for you"" with the damma and fatha on the meem meaning no residence or place ""so return"" to your homes in Medina and they had gone out with the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, to Sal'a mountain outside Medina to fight ""And a party of them asked permission of the Prophet"" to return ""They said, 'Our houses are vulnerable'"" not fortified and feared for. God Almighty said ""And it is not vulnerable. They only want to flee"" from the fighting. ""And if the fitnah had entered"" meaning the city ""upon them from its regions"" its areas ""and they were asked"" meaning those who entered asked them ""to be put to trial"" polytheism ""they would have brought it"" with the extension and shortening meaning they gave it and did it ""and you would not have remained in it except a little while"" ""And they had already made a covenant with God before that they would not turn their backs, and the covenant with God is to be questioned"" about fulfilling it. ""Say, 'Fleeing will not benefit you if you flee from death or killing. And if' if you flee ""you will not be able to do so.'"" You will enjoy in this world after your flight, except for a little while, the remainder of your life. Say: Who is it that can protect you from God if He intends evil for you, destruction and defeat, or afflict you with evil if God intends mercy for you? And they will not find for themselves besides God, that is, other than Him, a protector or a helper."
j-0822	“Allah may know those among you who hold back and say to their brothers, ‘Come to us,’ but do not come to the battle except a little, for show and to be heard. They are stingy with you.” With help, the plural of stingy is scornful, which is a state of the pronoun they come. “But when fear comes, you will see them looking at you, their eyes rolling like one who has fainted from death.” That is, its agonies. “But when the fear has departed” and the spoils are acquired, “they will smite you with sharp tongues, stingy with good.” That is, the spoils they seek. “Those have not believed.” In reality, “so Allah has rendered their deeds worthless, and that, the nullification, is easy for Allah.” By His will, “they think that the parties” of the infidels “have not gone” to Mecca because of their fear of them. “And if the parties come” another time, “they will wish” they wish “that they were nomads among the desert dwellers” that is, living in the desert “asking about your news” your news with the infidels. “And if they were among you” this time, “they would not have believed.” They fought only a little, out of hypocrisy and fear of reproach.
j-0823	"«There has certainly been for you in the Messenger of Allah an excellent example» by following his example in fighting and steadfastness in his battles «for him» instead of «for you» who «hopes for Allah» fears Him «and the Last Day and remembers Allah often» unlike those who do not. «And when the believers saw the parties» of the disbelievers «they said, “This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us” of testing and victory «and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth» in their promise «and it did not increase them» that «except in faith» belief in Allah’s promise «and submission» to His command «Among the believers are men true to what they pledged to Allah» of steadfastness with the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace «and among them is he who has fulfilled his vow» who died or was killed in the way of Allah «and among them is he who awaits» that «and they have not changed in the least» in their pledge, and they are unlike the state of the hypocrites

j-0824	"""And Allah repelled those who disbelieved"" that is, the parties ""in their fury, they did not obtain any good"" what they wanted from victory over the believers ""and Allah sufficed the believers in fighting"" with the wind and the angels ""and Allah is Powerful"" in bringing about what He wants ""mighty"" prevailing in His command ""and He brought down those who supported them from among the People of the Scripture"" that is, Qurayzah ""from their fortresses"" their fortresses, the plural of sisa, which is what one fortifies himself with ""and cast terror"" into their hearts fear ""a group of them you killed"" that is, the fighters ""and you took captive a group of them"" that is, the children ""and He gave you inheritance of their land and their homes and their wealth and a land you had not yet trodden"" that is, Khaybar, which was taken after Qurayzah ""and Allah is over all things competent"""

""But if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the home of the Hereafter,"" that is, Paradise, ""then indeed, Allah has prepared for the good-doers among you,"" by desiring the Hereafter, ""a great reward,"" that is, Paradise, so choose the Hereafter over this world. ""O wives of the Prophet, whoever among you commits a clear immorality,"" with the opening of the ya' and its kasra, meaning clear or it is clear, ""it will be doubled,"" and in another reading, it is doubled with emphasis, and in another, we double with the nun with it and the accusative of the punishment, ""for her is the punishment double,"" double the punishment of others, that is, twice as much, ""and that is easy for Allah."" ""And whoever among you is obedient,"" obeys, ""Allah and His Messenger and does righteousness, We will give her her reward twice,"" that is, twice the reward of other women, and in another reading, with the lower tanween in ""works"" and ""we give her,"" ""and We have prepared for her provision."" Generous in heaven"
j-0826	"""O wives of the Prophet, you are not like any other woman. If you fear Allah, then you are greater. Then do not be soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease, hypocrisy, should covet, and speak an appropriate word, without submission. And Qarn with a kasra or a fatha on the qaf in your houses from qarār, and its origin is iqrārna with a kasra or a fatha on the ra’ ​​from qarārat with a fatha on the ra’ ​​and a kasra, the movement of the ra’ ​​was transferred to the qaf and it was deleted with the hamzat al-wasl. And do not display yourselves by omitting one of the two ta’s from its origin, the display of the first Jahiliyyah, that is, before Islam, when women would show their beauty to men. And displaying it after Islam is mentioned in the verse: And do not display your adornment except that which is apparent thereof. And establish prayer and give zakāt and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only desires to remove from you the uncleanness and sin, O people of the House, that is, the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. And to purify you from it with a thorough purification. And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah, the Qur’an, and wisdom, the Sunnah, for Allah is ever Kind, to His friends, Acquainted, with all His creation."

j-0828	It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should have the choice, that is, the choice of their affair contrary to the command of Allah and His Messenger. It was revealed about Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his sister Zaynab. The Prophet proposed to her for Zayd ibn Haritha. They thought about that when they knew, because they thought before that the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had proposed to her for himself. Then they agreed, according to the verse: “And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error.” So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, married her to Zayd. Then his sight fell on her after a while, and love for her fell into his soul, and dislike for her fell into Zayd’s soul. Then he said to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, “I want to divorce her.” He said, “Keep your wife to yourself,” as Allah the Almighty said. “And when” is in the accusative case with “remember,” “you said to him upon whom Allah had bestowed favor” with Islam “and upon whom you had bestowed favor” with emancipation, and he was Zayd ibn Haritha, who was among the captives of the Jahiliyyah. The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, bought him before the mission, emancipated him, and adopted him, “Keep your wife to yourself and fear Allah,” in the matter of divorcing her, “and you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to reveal,” revealing it from Her love and that if Zaid had left her, she would have married her. “And you feared people” that they would say he married his son’s wife. “And God has more right that you should fear Him” in everything. He married her and you do not care about what people say. Then Zaid divorced her and her waiting period ended. God Almighty said: “So when Zaid had no longer any need for her,” a need, “We married her to you,” so the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, entered upon her without permission and fed the Muslims bread and meat “so that there would be no blame upon the believers concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they have no longer any need for them. And the command of God” decreed, “is done.” “There is no blame upon the Prophet for what God has ordained for him. This is the way of God” meaning like the way of God, so the subject is in the accusative case by removing the preposition “in those who passed on before” of the prophets, that there is no blame upon them in that, giving them an expansion in marriage. “And the command of God” His action “is a decreed” decreed. “Those” is a description of those before him, “who convey the messages of God and fear Him and do not fear anyone except God” so they do not fear what people say about what God has made permissible for them. “And sufficient is Allah as a Reckoner” He preserves the deeds of His creation and holds them accountable. “Muhammad is not the father of any of your men” He is not the father of Zayd, i.e. his father, so it is not forbidden for him to marry his wife Zaynab. “But” he was “the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets” He would not have a male son after him who would be a prophet. In a reading with the opening of the ta’ like the sealing tool, i.e. they sealed with him. “And Allah is Knowing of all things” including that there is no prophet after him, and when the Master Jesus descends, he will rule according to his law.
j-0829	"“O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance.”

j-0831	“O you who believe! When you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them,” and in another reading, “you have no waiting period to count for them,” count it by menstrual periods or otherwise, “then provide for them,” give them what they enjoy, that is, if no dowries have been specified for them, otherwise they are only entitled to half of what has been specified. This was said by Ibn Abbas, and Al-Shafi’i agreed with him. “And release them with gracious release,” set them free without causing them harm. O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their dowries, “and those your right hand possesses from what Allah has given you,” from the infidels through captivity, such as Safiyyah and Juwayriyah, “and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you,” unlike those who did not emigrate, “and a believing woman if she offers herself to the Prophet, if the Prophet wishes to marry her,” he seeks to marry her without a dowry, “she is exclusively for you, apart from the believers.” Marriage in the wording The gift without a dowry “We have already known what We have imposed upon them” meaning the believers “regarding their wives” of the rulings that they should not exceed four women and that they should not marry except with a guardian and witnesses and a dowry “and” “those whom their right hands possess” of female slaves by purchase or otherwise, such that the female slave should be one of those who are permissible for her owner, such as a woman of the Book, unlike a Zoroastrian or a pagan, and that she should be purified before intercourse “so that” related to what preceded that “there may not be upon you difficulty” tightness in marriage “and Allah is Forgiving” in what is difficult to avoid “and Merciful” in expanding that “you may postpone” with the hamza and the ya’ instead of it, you delay “whoever you wish of them” meaning your wives from their turn “and you may take” you include “to yourself whomever you wish” of them so that you may come to them “and whoever you seek” you ask “of those whom you have set aside” from the division “there is no blame upon you” in seeking her and including her with you, better in that after the division was obligatory upon him “that” the choice “is nearer” closer to “that their eyes may be comforted and they may not grieve and they may be satisfied with what they have set aside” “I have given them all” what the one who has been given the choice mentioned, “and God knows what is in your hearts” regarding women and the inclination towards some of them, and We have given you the choice of them to make everything you want easier for you, “and God is Knowing” of His creation, “Forbearing” about punishing them. “It is not lawful for you” with the ta’ and the ya’ “women after that” the nine whom I have chosen, “nor that you exchange” by leaving out one of the two ta’s in the original, “for them other wives” by divorcing them or some of them and marrying instead of the one you divorced, “even though their beauty pleases you, except those your right hand possesses” of female slaves, so it is lawful for you, and the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, took possession of Maria after them, and she bore him Ibrahim, who died during his lifetime, “and God is ever Watchful over everything,” Preserver.
j-0832	“O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet except when permission is given to you” to enter by invitation “for food” so you enter “not waiting” waiting “for it” to be cooked, the source of “any” is “when it is ready”. “But when you are invited, then enter, and when you have eaten, disperse and do not” remain “seeking comfort in conversation” of one another. “Indeed, that” remaining “used to annoy the Prophet, so he would be shy of you” to expel you “and Allah is not shy of the truth” to expel you, that is, he does not leave out its statement. It was read “is shy” with one “ya”. “And when you ask them” meaning the wives of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, “for something, ask them from behind a partition” a screen “that is purer for your hearts and their hearts” from suspicious thoughts “and it is not for you to annoy the Messenger of Allah” with anything “nor to marry his wives after him ever. Indeed, that would be in the sight of Allah” a “tremendous” sin “whether you disclose anything or conceal it” of marrying them after him “then indeed Allah is ever aware of all things”. “There is no blame upon them concerning their fathers, nor their sons, nor their brothers, nor their brothers’ sons, nor their sisters’ sons, nor their women,” that is, the believing women, “nor those their right hands possess,” of female slaves and male slaves, so that they may see them and speak to them without a veil, “and fear God,” in what you have been commanded, “for God is ever, over all things, a Witness,” nothing is hidden from Him.

""Indeed, those who abuse Allah and His Messenger"" meaning the disbelievers, who describe Allah with what He is far removed from, such as having a son or a partner, and who belie His Messenger, ""Allah has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter"", has distanced them ""and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment"" of humiliation, which is the Fire.

j-0834	“O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments,” the plural of jilbab, which is the sheet that a woman covers herself with, i.e., to let some of it hang down over her face when she goes out for her needs, except for one eye. “That is more suitable,” closer to “that they will be known,” that they are free women, “and not be bothered,” by being exposed to them, unlike slave women, who do not cover their faces, as the hypocrites used to expose themselves to them. “And ever is Allah Forgiving,” for what they have done in the past of not covering themselves, “Merciful,” to them, since He has covered them.
j-0835	“If” the oath lam “the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is a disease” fornication “and those who spread rumors in the city” the believers, saying, “The enemy has come to you and your troops have been killed or defeated,” “do not desist,” “We will surely incite you against them,” “We will give you power over them,” “and then they will not be your neighbors,” “inhabit you,” “therein except for a little,” then they will go out “cursed,” banished from mercy. “Wherever they are found,” “they will be seized and killed in a grievous slaughter,” that is, the ruling on them is this according to the command to do so. “This is the way of Allah,” that is, the way of Allah “with those who passed on before,” of the past nations, with their hypocrites who spread rumors among the believers, “and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.”

j-0837	"O you who believe! Be not with your Prophet like those who harmed Moses by saying, for example, “What prevents him from washing with us except that he is a liar?” So Allah cleared him of what they said by placing his garment on a rock to wash, but the rock flew away with him until he stood among a group of the Children of Israel. Moses caught up with him, took his garment, and covered himself with it, so they saw him, and he did not have a testicle. He was honorable and respected in the sight of Allah. Among the things with which our Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was harmed was that he divided a portion, and a man said, “This is a division that is not intended for the sake of Allah Almighty.” So the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, became angry at that and said, “May Allah have mercy on Moses. He was harmed with more than this, but he was patient.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari
“O you who believe! Fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice.” Correct. “He will amend for you your deeds” He will accept them. “And forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly achieved a great attainment.” He has attained a desired goal."

“So turn away from them,” meaning turn away from the disbelievers of Mecca, “until a time,” when you are commanded to fight them.

“And observe them,” when the punishment descends upon them, “for they will see,” the consequences of their disbelief.

So they said in mockery: When will this punishment descend? God Almighty said, threatening them. “Do they then hasten Our punishment?”

“So when it descends upon their courtyard,” upon their courtyard, Al-Farra’ said: The Arabs are satisfied with mentioning the courtyard from the people. “How evil,” how evil is the morning, “the morning of those who are warned,” in which the apparent replaces the implicit.

“Or do they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Exalted in Might” the Prevailing “The Bestower” of prophethood and other things, so they give it to whomever they wish

“Or “For them is the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them.” If they claim that, “then let them ascend through the means” leading to heaven, so that they may bring revelation and single out whomever they wish. “Am” in both places has the meaning of a hamza of denial. “An army” means they are a contemptible army “there” in their denial of you “is defeated” is an attribute of an army “of the parties” is also an attribute of an army, meaning like the armies of the same kind as the parties who sided with the prophets before you, and those were defeated and destroyed, so thus will We destroy these."

j-0894	God Almighty said: “Be patient over what they say, and remember Our servant David, the man of strength.” That is, the strength in worship. He used to fast one day and break his fast the next, and he would stand in prayer for half the night, sleep a third of it, and stand in prayer a sixth of it. “He was one who frequently turned back [to God].” He returned to God’s pleasure. “Indeed, We subjected the mountains to him, glorifying Him in the evening and at sunrise.” That is, when the sun rises and its light reaches its peak. “And We subjected the birds gathered together.” They gathered to him, glorifying Him with him. “Every one of them, the mountains and the birds, was for him frequently turning back.” They returned to His obedience by glorifying Him. “And We strengthened his kingdom.” We strengthened him with bells and soldiers, and thirty thousand men guarded his prayer niche every night. “And We gave him wisdom.” Prophethood and correctness in matters. “And decisive speech.” The clear statement in every intention.

So the two angels ascending in their forms to the heaven said, ""The man has judged himself."" So David became aware. God Almighty said, ""And David thought"" that is, he was certain ""that We had only tried him"" that We had caused him to fall into a trial, that is, a calamity, because of his love for that woman.

""Or shall We treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like those who corrupt on earth? Or shall We treat the righteous like the wicked?"" It was revealed when the disbelievers of Mecca said to the believers, ""We will give in the Hereafter what you give."" And ""am"" means the hamza of denial.

""Bring them back to me,"" meaning the horses presented, so they returned them.

And We certainly tried Solomon, We tested him by taking away his kingdom, because he married a woman he loved and she used to worship an idol in his house without his knowledge. His kingdom was in his ring, so he took it off once when he wanted to relieve himself and put it with his wife, who was called Al-Aminah, as was his custom. Then a jinn came to her in the form of Solomon and took it from her. And We cast upon his throne a body, that jinn being Sakhr or someone else, who sat upon Solomon’s throne and the birds and others swarmed around him. Solomon came out in a form other than his own and saw him on his throne and said to the people, “I am Solomon,” but they denied him. Then he repented, Solomon returned to his kingdom after a few days by reaching the ring, putting it on and sitting upon his throne. He said, “My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me,” meaning other than me, like “who will guide him after Allah?” meaning other than Allah. “Indeed, You are the Bestower.” So We subjected to him the wind, blowing gently by his command.

j-0901	"«This» mentioned for the believers «and indeed for the transgressors» is a new chapter «is an evil destination» «Hell, they will burn it» they will enter it «so wretched is the resting place» the bed «this» meaning the torment understood from what follows «so let them taste it, scalding water» meaning hot, burning water «and pus» with the emphasis and the emphasis, what flows from the pus of the people of the Fire «and another» with the plural and singular «of its kind» meaning like the mentioned scalding water and pus «pairs» types meaning their torment is of different types
and it will be said to them when they enter the Fire with their followers «this is a group» plural «storming» entering «with you» the Fire intensely so the followers will say «there is no welcome for them» meaning there is no room for them «for they have entered the Fire» «they will say» meaning the followers «rather you are not welcome, you have brought it» meaning disbelief «for us, so wretched is the resting place» for us and for you the Fire» «they will say» also «our Lord, whoever brought this to us, then increase for him a double punishment» meaning like his punishment for his disbelief «in the Fire» «and they will say» That is, the infidels of Mecca, who are in the Fire. “Why do we not see men whom we used to count” in this world “among the wicked?” “We took them in mockery” with a damma on the seen and a kasra on it. We used to mock them in this world, and the ya’ is for relation. That is, are they missing? “Or have the eyes turned away from them?” so they did not see them, and they are the poor Muslims, like Ammar, Bilal, Suhayb, and Sulayman. “Indeed, that is the truth” it must happen, and it is “the dispute of the people of the Fire” as mentioned above."
j-0902	"«Say» O Muhammad to the infidels of Mecca «I am only a warner» frightened by the Fire «and there is no god except Allah, the One, the Prevailing» for His creation «Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them, the Exalted in Might» The Victorious in His affair «The Forgiving» for His friends «Say» to them «It is a tremendous news» «You are turning away from it» that is, the Qur’an which I have informed you of and in which I have brought you what is not known except by revelation, which is His saying «I had no knowledge of the highest assembly» that is, the angels «when they disputed» concerning Adam when God Almighty said, «I am making a vicegerent on earth» etc. «It is not» that «that is revealed to me except that I am» that is, «a clear warner» between the warning «Remember «when your Lord said to the angels, «I am going to create a human being from clay» that is, Adam «then when I have proportioned him» completed him «and breathed» made flow «into him of My spirit» so he became alive and adding the spirit to him is an honor for Adam and the spirit is a subtle body by which man lives through its influence in him «so fall down to him in prostration» a prostration of greeting By bowing

""So the angels prostrated, all of them together"" in it there are two confirmations

""Except Iblis"" he is the father of the jinn, he was among the angels ""He was arrogant and was among the disbelievers"" in the knowledge of Allah the Most High

""He said, ""O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands"" i.e. I took charge of its creation, and this is an honor for Adam, for every creature Allah took charge of its creation ""Were you arrogant"" now about prostrating, a question of rebuke ""Or were you among the exalted ones"" the arrogant ones, so you were arrogant about prostrating because you were among them

""He said, ""I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay""
""He said, ""Then get out of it"" i.e. from Paradise, and it was said from the heavens ""For indeed, you are expelled""
""And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Judgment"" the recompense

""He said, ""My Lord, then respite me until the Day they are resurrected"" i.e. the people
""He said, ""For indeed, you are among those respite""
""Until the Day of the appointed time"" the time of the first trumpet blast
""He said, ""Then by Your might, I will mislead them all""
""Except Your chosen servants among them"" i.e. the believers
""He said, ""Then the truth, and I speak the truth"" By erecting them and raising the first and erecting the second, so he erected it with the verb after it and erecting the first, it was said with the mentioned verb and it was said with the source, meaning the most deserving of the truth, and it was said with the removal of the letter of the oath and raising it as a subject with the predicate deleted, meaning the truth is from me, and it was said the truth is my oath and the answer to the oath

“I will fill Hell with you” with your offspring “and with those who follow you among them” meaning the people “all together”

“Say: I do not ask you for it” for conveying the message “of reward” making “and I am not of those who make up” the Qur’an of my own accord

“It” meaning the Qur’an “is only a reminder” a sermon “for the worlds” for mankind, jinn, and rational beings, not the angels

“And you will surely know” O disbelievers of Mecca “its news” the news of his truthfulness “after a while” meaning on the Day of Resurrection, and “know” means “know” and the lam before it is an oath lam that is understood, meaning by God"
j-0903	"""The revelation of the Book"" the Qur'an is the subject ""from Allah"" its predicate ""the Almighty"" in His kingdom ""the Wise"" in His creation ""Indeed, We have sent down to you"" O Muhammad ""the Book in truth"" related to ""sent down"" ""so worship Allah, devoting religion to Him sincerely"" from polytheism, i.e., making Him One
""Indeed, Allah is the pure religion"" none other than Him deserves it ""and those who take besides Him"" ​​the idols ""as allies"" they are the disbelievers of Mecca they said ""we only worship them that they may bring us nearer to Allah"" nearness is a source meaning nearly ""indeed Allah will judge between them"" and the Muslims ""in that over which they differ"" in the matter of religion so that the believers will enter Paradise and the disbelievers will enter Hell ""indeed Allah does not guide one who is a liar"" in attributing a son to Him ""disbelievers"" in worshipping other than Allah
""If Allah had willed to take a son"" as they said the Most Merciful took a son ""He would have chosen from what He created what He willed"" and took a son other than those they said the angels are daughters of Allah and Ezra is the son of Allah and the Messiah is the son of Allah ""glory be to Him"" ​​in exalting Him from taking a son ""He is Allah, the One, the Prevailing"" To create Him

“He created the heavens and the earth in truth” is related to creation. “He wraps” includes “the night over the day” and increases it. “And He wraps the day” includes it “over the night” and increases it. “And He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running” in its orbit “for a specified term” until the Day of Resurrection. “Is He not the Exalted in Might” is the Victorious in His affair, the Avenger of His enemies, “the Forgiving” of His friends."
j-0904	“He created you from a single soul,” meaning Adam, “then made from it its mate,” Eve, “and sent down for you from the livestock,” camels, cows, sheep, and goats, “eight mates,” each pair being a male and a female, as explained in Surat Al-An’am. “He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation,” meaning sperm, then clots, then chewed, “in three layers of darkness,” namely the darkness of the belly, the darkness of the womb, and the darkness of the placenta. “That is Allah, your Lord; to Him belongs the kingdom. There is no deity except Him. So how are you diverted?” from worshipping Him to worshipping anyone other than Him. “If you disbelieve, then indeed Allah is free from need of you. And He does not like disbelief for His servants,” even if He intended it from some of them. “And if you are grateful,” meaning Allah, then believe, “He is pleased with it,” with the ha’ being silent and with a damma with a full vowel, and without it, meaning gratitude, “for you. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another soul,” meaning it will not bear it. “Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts,” of what is in the hearts. “And when a man touches a woman, and she is ungrateful, then he will be pleased with her.” Man, that is, the disbeliever, “is distressed when he calls upon his Lord, turning back to Him. Then, when He bestows upon him a favor from Him, he forgets what he used to call upon before, beseeching Him.” That is, God, so there is no place for “and God has made equals” partners “to mislead” with the opening of the ya’ and its closing “from His way,” the religion of Islam. “Say, ‘Enjoy your disbelief for a little, for the rest of your life, for you are among the companions of the Fire.’”
j-0905	“Safe” with a lightened “mim” “is one who is obedient” performing the duties of obedience “during the hours of the night” its hours “prostrating and standing” in prayer “wary of the Hereafter” that is, fearing its punishment “and hoping for the mercy” of the Paradise “of his Lord” like someone who is disobedient through disbelief or otherwise. In the reading of “am” from “am” the word “mim” means “but” and the hamza “Say: Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” That is, they are not equal, just as the knowledgeable and the ignorant are not equal? ​​“Only those of understanding will remember” take heed “say: O my servants who have believed, fear your Lord” that is, His punishment by obeying Him. “For those who do good in this world” through obedience “is good” which is Paradise “and the earth of Allah is spacious” so they migrated to it from among the disbelievers and witnessing evils. “Only those who are patient” in obedience and what they are tested with “will be given their reward without account” without measure or scale.
j-0906	"""Say, 'I have been commanded to worship Allah, devoting my religion to Him sincerely' from polytheism. ""And I have been commanded to be the first of the Muslims from this nation. ""Say, 'I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day.'"" ""Say, 'Allah I worship, devoting my religion to Him sincerely' from polytheism. ""So worship whatever you wish besides Him.'"" This is a threat to them and a sign that they do not worship Allah the Most High. ""Say, 'Indeed, the losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection.'"" By immortalizing their souls in Hell and not reaching the houris prepared for them in Paradise, if they had believed. ""Unquestionably, that is the manifest loss.'"" The obvious. ""They will have canopies above them, layers, of the Fire, and canopies beneath them, of the Fire. ""That is how Allah frightens His servants,"" meaning the believers, so that they may fear Him. This is indicated by ""O My servants, then fear Allah."" ""And those who avoid the Taghut,"" the idols, ""from worshipping them and turn back,"" turn, ""to Allah, for them is good tidings,"" of Paradise. ""So give good tidings to My servants."" ""Those who listen to the Word."" They follow the best of it,” which is what is good for them. “Those are the ones whom God has guided, and those are the ones of understanding,” the people of intellects. “Then is he upon whom the word of punishment has come into effect?” That is, “I will fill Hell.” “Then will you save” bring out “one who is in the Fire?” The answer to the condition, and the apparent is used in it in place of the implied, and the hamza is for denial, and the meaning is that you will not be able to guide him and save him from the Fire. “But those who feared their Lord” by obeying Him, “for them are chambers, one above another, chambers built, beneath which rivers flow,” that is, beneath the upper and lower chambers. “The promise of God” is in the accusative case with its implied verb. “God does not fail in His promise,” His promise."
j-0907	"“Have you not seen that God sends down water from the sky, and makes it flow as springs in the earth, then produces thereby crops of varying colors, then it withers and you see it yellow, then He makes it debris. Indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding. They remember because of its indication of the oneness of God Almighty and His power. “Then is he whose breast God has expanded to Islam,” so he is guided, “so he is upon a light from his Lord,” like someone whose heart has been sealed, indicating this. “So woe,” the word “punishment,” “to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of God.” That is, against accepting the Qur’an. “Those are in manifest error.” “God has sent down the best statement, a Book,” instead of the best, that is, a Qur’an, “consistent,” that is, some of it resembles others in arrangement and other things. “Repeated,” in which there is a duality of promise and threat and other things. “The skins of those who fear Him tremble at it,” the threat trembles at the mention of Him. ""They fear their Lord, then their skins and hearts soften at the remembrance of God,"" that is, at the remembrance of His promise. ""That,"" that is, the Book, ""is the guidance of God by which He guides whom He wills. And whomsoever God sends astray, for him there is no guide."" ""Then is he who fears,"" that is, will be met with ""the worst of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection,"" that is, the most severe of which is that he will be thrown into the Fire with his hands chained to his neck, like he who is secure from it by entering Paradise. ""And it will be said to the wrongdoers,"" that is, the disbelievers of Mecca, ""Taste what you used to earn,"" that is, its recompense. ""Those before them denied,"" their messengers in bringing the punishment, ""so the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive,"" from a direction that did not occur to them. ""So God made them taste disgrace,"" humiliation and disgrace from being transformed and killed and other things, ""in the life of this world. And the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they,"" that is, the deniers, ""knew,"" of its punishment, that they denied it."
j-0908	"""And We have certainly presented for the people in this Qur'an every kind of example that they may remember"" be admonished. ""An Arabic Qur'an"" is an emphatic state ""without any crookedness"" that is, confusion and difference ""that they may fear"" disbelief. ""Allah has presented"" for the polytheist and the monotheist ""an example: a man"" instead of an example ""in whom are partners who are quarreling"" who are disputing and have bad morals ""and a man who is sound"" pure ""to a man. Are they equal in example?"" Distinguishing, that is, a slave who is with his group and a slave who is with one person are not equal. If the first is asked by both of his owners to serve him at the same time, he is confused about who will serve him among them. This is an example for the polytheist and the second is an example for the monotheist. ""Praise be to Allah"" alone. ""But most of them"" that is, the people of Mecca ""do not know"" what punishment they will face, so they associate partners. ""Indeed, you"" is addressed to the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ""are going to die, and indeed they are going to die"" you will die and they will die, so there is no gloating over death that was revealed because they were impatient for his death, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. ""Then you"" O people, in the injustices that are between you On the Day of Resurrection, you will dispute before your Lord."
j-0909	«So who» meaning no one «is more unjust than he who lies about Allah» by attributing a partner and a son to Him «and denies the truth» the Qur’an «when it comes to him? Is there not in Hell an abode» a shelter «for the disbelievers» Yes! «And he who brought the truth» is the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace «and believed in it» they are the believers, so «who» means «those» «they are the righteous» polytheism «for them is whatever they wish with their Lord. That is the reward of the doers of good» for themselves by their faith «that Allah may remove from them the worst of what they did and reward them with the best of what they used to do» Worse and better mean bad and good? «Is not Allah sufficient for His servant» meaning the Prophet? Yes! «And they frighten you» the address is to him «with those besides Him» meaning the idols, that they might kill him or make him mad «and he whom Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide» «and he whom Allah guides, for him there is no misguider. Is not Allah Exalted in Might» dominant in His affair «possessor of vengeance» of His enemies? Yes!
j-0910	"""And if"" the oath lam ""you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will surely say, ""Allah."" Say, ""Have you considered what you call upon besides Allah?"" that is, the idols. ""If Allah intends me harm, can they remove His harm?"" No. ""Or if He intends me mercy, can they withhold His mercy?"" No. In a reading with the addition of both of them, ""Say, 'Allah is sufficient for me. Upon Him do the trusting rely.'"" The trustful trust. ""Say, 'O my people, act according to your position. Indeed, I am acting. You will soon know who will be visited by a punishment that will disgrace him and upon whom will be descended a lasting punishment.'"" That is, the punishment of the Fire. Allah disgraced them at Badr."
j-0911	“Indeed, We have sent down to you the Book for mankind in truth.” It is related to “sent down.” “So whoever is guided does so for the benefit of [his own] soul.” His guidance. “And whoever goes astray only goes astray to its detriment. And you are not a guardian over them.” So you force them to guidance.
j-0912	“Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and He takes those that do not die during their sleep,” that is, He takes them at the time of sleep. “He keeps those for whom He has decreed death and sends the others back for a specified term,” that is, the time of their death. The sent one is the same distinction; without it the same life remains, unlike the opposite. “Indeed in that,” that is, what is mentioned, “are signs,” indications, “for a people who give thought,” so they know that the One who is able to do that is able to resurrect, and the Quraysh did not give thought to that. “Or,” rather, “have they taken other than Allah,” that is, the idols as gods, “intercessors,” on behalf of Allah, according to their claim? “Say,” to them, “Do they intercede, even though they do not possess anything,” of intercession or anything else, “nor do they understand,” that you worship them or anything else? “Say, ‘To Allah belongs all intercession,’” that is, He is the only one who can intercede, so no one can intercede except with His permission. “To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you will be returned.”
j-0913	“And when Allah alone is mentioned,” that is, without their gods, “the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter are disgusted,” that is, the idols, “feel aversion and shrink.” “And when those besides Him are mentioned,” that is, the idols, “at once they rejoice.” “Say, ‘O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, You judge between Your servants concerning that over which they used to differ.’” In matters of religion, guide me to the truth about which they used to differ. “And if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth and as much more with it, they would offer it as ransom from the evil of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. And there will appear to them from Allah that which they had never imagined. And there will appear to them the evil of what they had earned, and that which they used to ridicule will befall them.” That is, the punishment.
j-0914	“So when harm befalls man, he calls upon Us. Then when We grant him a favor from Us, he says, ‘I have only been given it because of knowledge.’ From God, that I am worthy of it. ‘Rather, it is a trial,’ that is, the statement, ‘but most of them do not know.’ That is, the grant is a temptation and a test. ‘Those before them had already said it,’ from the nations, such as Qarun and his people, who were satisfied with it. ‘But what they used to earn did not avail them.’ ‘So the evil of what they earned befell them.’ That is, its recompense. ‘And those who did wrong among these,’ that is, the Quraysh, ‘the evil of what they earned will befall them, and they will not escape.’ ‘Do they not know that God expands provision, expands it, ‘for whomever He wills,’ as a test, ‘and restricts it,’ as a test. ‘Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.’”
j-0915	“Say, ‘O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who repents from polytheism.’” “And turn back to your Lord and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you; then you will not be aided.” “And follow the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord,” that is, the Qur’an, “before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you perceive not.” “And hasten before a soul says, ‘Oh, how I regret it,’” its root is “Oh, how I regret it,’ for having neglected my duty to Allah,” that is, obeying Him. “And indeed,” lightened from heavy “and indeed,” “I was among the mockers,” of His religion and Book. “Or say, ‘If only Allah had guided me,’ with obedience so that I was guided, ‘I would have been among the righteous,’” of His punishment. “Or say, when you see the punishment, ‘If only I had “Ball” is a return to the world “so I will be among the doers of good” the believers, and it will be said to him by God “Yes, My signs have come to you” the Qur’an, which is the reason for guidance “but you denied them and were arrogant” you were arrogant about believing in them “and you were among the disbelievers”
j-0916	"""And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who lied about Allah"" by attributing a partner and a son to Him ""their faces will be blackened. Is there not in Hell a roasting place"" a refuge ""for the arrogant"" from faith? Yes.

""And Allah will save"" from Hell ""those who feared Allah"" polytheism ""with their place of success"" that is, with their place of success in Paradise, where they will be placed ""no harm will touch them, nor will they grieve.""

""And those who disbelieve in the signs of Allah"" the Qur'an ""they are the losers."" Connected to His saying, ""And Allah will save those who feared Allah"" etc. and what is between them is an interruption.

""Say, 'Is it other than Allah that you order me to worship, O ignorant ones?'"" is not accusative with ""I worship"" the object of ""to order me"" with the estimation that there is one son and two sons by assimilation and separation.

""And it has already been revealed to you and to those before you"" and Allah ""if you associate"" O Muhammad, an obligation ""your work will surely be in vain. And you will surely be among the losers.” “Rather, worship God” alone “and be among the grateful” for His favors upon you. “And they have not esteemed God with His true esteem” they did not know Him with His true knowledge or they did not glorify Him with His true greatness when they associated others with Him. “And the earth entirely” a state, meaning the seven “is in His grip” meaning clenched for Him, meaning in His possession and control “on the Day of Resurrection and the heavens are folded” gathered “in His right hand” by His power. “Glory be to Him and He is exalted above what they associate” with Him."
j-0917	“And the Trumpet will be blown,” the first blast, “and all who are in the heavens and on the earth will fall dead, except whom Allah wills,” of the houris, the parents, and others. “Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be,” that is, all dead creatures, “standing, looking,” waiting to see what will be done with them. “And the earth will shine,” illuminated, “with the light of its Lord,” when Allah will appear to pass judgment. “And the Book will be placed,” the Book of deeds, for the reckoning. “And the prophets and the witnesses will be brought,” that is, Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and his nation, bearing witness to the message for the messengers. “And it will be judged between them with truth,” that is, justice, “and they will not be wronged,” in anything. “And every soul will be fully compensated for what it has done,” that is, its reward, “and He is most knowing,” All-Knowing, “of what they do,” so He does not need a witness.

""And they will say"" In reference to its estimated entry, “Praise be to God, who has fulfilled His promise to us” of Paradise “and has given us the earth as an inheritance” that is, the land of Paradise “to settle” we descend “in Paradise wherever we will” because it is all in it, no place is chosen over another “so excellent is the reward of the workers” Paradise “And you will see the angels surrounding” a state “around the Throne” on every side of it “glorifying” a state of the pronoun surrounding “with the praise of their Lord” dressed in praise, that is, they say, Glory be to God and His praise “and it will be judged between them” between all of creation “with truth” that is, justice, so the believers will enter Paradise and the unbelievers will enter Hell “and it will be said, ‘Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds’” the settlement of the two groups was concluded with praise from the angels"

""The Forgiver of sin"" for the believers ""and the Accepter of repentance"" for them is a source ""severe in punishment"" for the disbelievers, meaning severe in punishment ""the Lord of bounty"" the vast bounty and He is always described with all these attributes, so adding the derivative from it for the purpose of definition is like the last ""There is no god but He, to Him is the final destination"" the reference

""None disputes concerning the verses of Allah"" the Qur'an ""except those who disbelieve"" from the people of Mecca ""so let not their moving about in the lands deceive you"" for a livelihood in safety, for their end is the Fire"

And every nation intended to seize their Messenger” to kill him “and they argued with falsehood to refute” to remove “the truth thereby, so I seized them” with punishment “so how was My punishment” for them, meaning it will take its place. And thus the word of your Lord has come true, meaning, “I will surely fill Hell” the verse on those who disbelieved is that they are the people of the Fire instead of the word
j-0921	“Those who bear the Throne” is the subject “and those around it” is in apposition to it “glorify” is its predicate “with praise of their Lord” wearing praise, that is, they say, “Glory be to God and His praise” “and believe in Him” the Most High with their insights, that is, they believe in His oneness “and ask forgiveness for those who believe” they say, “Our Lord, You have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge” that is, Your mercy has encompassed all things and Your knowledge has encompassed all things “so forgive those who have repented” from polytheism “and followed Your way” the religion of Islam “and protect them from the punishment of Hellfire” the Fire “Our Lord, and admit them to the Gardens of Eden” the establishment “which You have promised them and whoever is righteous” is in apposition to them in “and admit them” or in their promise “of their fathers and their spouses and their descendants. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise” in His creation “and protect them from evil” that is, their punishment “and whoever is protected from evil on that Day” the Day of Resurrection “has lost his mercy and that is the great attainment.”
j-0922	“Indeed, those who disbelieve will be called out” by the angels, while they are loathing themselves when they enter the Fire, “The hatred of Allah” for you “is greater than your hatred of yourselves when you were called” in this world “to faith and you disbelieved.” “They will say, ‘Our Lord, You caused us to die twice’” twice “and You gave us life twice” twice because they were dead sperm, so they were brought to life, then they were brought to death, then they were brought to life for the Resurrection. “So we have acknowledged our sins” for our disbelief in the Resurrection. “Is there any way out” from the Fire and returning to this world to obey our Lord? “A way.” Their answer is, “No.” “That” that is, the torment you are in “is because” that is, because it is in this world “when Allah alone is called upon, you disbelieve” in His Oneness. “But if partners are associated with Him” he makes a partner for Him, “you believe” you acknowledge the association. “Then the judgment” in your torment “is with Allah, the Most High” over His creation, “the Great” the Majestic.

“on the Day when they will appear” coming out of their graves “nothing of them will be hidden from Allah. To whom belongs the dominion today” by the Most High’s words and answers Himself “to Allah, the One, the Prevailing” meaning His creation
“Today every soul will be recompensed for what it has earned. There is no injustice today. Indeed, Allah is swift in account” He will hold all creation accountable in the space of half a day of the days of this world according to a hadith about that
And warn them of the approaching Day, the Day of Resurrection, when the departure is near, when the hearts rise in fear, and at the throats, they are choking, filled with grief. A state of the hearts treated in the plural with the letter ya and the letter nun, the treatment of their owners. The wrongdoers have no loving intimate friend, nor an intercessor who is obeyed. The description has no meaning, since they have no intercessor at all. So we have no intercessors. The first is a meaning based on their claim that they have intercessors, that is, if they interceded as an obligation, they would not be accepted. “He knows, that is, God, the treachery of the eyes” by their squinting at what is forbidden, “and what the breasts conceal,” the hearts. “And God judges with truth. And those whom they invoke,” that is, the infidels of Mecca with the letter ya and the letter ta, “other than Him,” and they are the idols, “do not judge at anything,” so how can they be partners with God? “Indeed, God is the Hearing,” of their words, “the Seeing,” of their actions."
j-0924	“Have they not traveled through the land and observed what was the end of those before them? They were stronger than them in strength and in traces on the earth,” in factories and palaces. “So God seized them,” destroyed them, “for their sins, and they had no protector from God,” from His punishment. “That is because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs,” with apparent miracles, “but they disbelieved, so God seized them. Indeed, He is Powerful and Severe in penalty.”

j-0926	“And a believing man from the family of Pharaoh” it was said that he was his cousin “who concealed his faith said, ‘Will you kill a man who says, “My Lord is Allah” and he has come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? And if he is a liar, upon him is his lie. But if he is truthful, some of what he promises you will befall you. Indeed, Allah guides not one who is a transgressor, a liar, a slanderer. “O my people, yours is the kingdom this day, dominant in the land. So who will protect us from the wrath of Allah if it comes to us?” “Pharaoh said, “I only show you what I see.” That is, I only advise you with what I advise myself, which is the killing of Moses. “And I guide you only to the path of right conduct.” The path of righteousness. “And he who believed said, “O my people, indeed I fear for you like the Day of the Confederates.” That is, the day of party after party. “Like the practice of the people of Noah, ‘Aad, and Thamud, and those who were before them.” After them” is like a substitute for like before it, meaning like the usual punishment of those who disbelieved before you in their punishment in this world. “And Allah does not desire injustice for His servants.” “And O my people, indeed I fear for you the Day of Calling” by deleting the “ya” and proving it, meaning the Day of Resurrection, when the people of Paradise will call out to the people of Hell frequently, and vice versa, and calling out happiness for its people and misery for its people, and other than that. “On the Day when you turn your backs, departing” from the place of reckoning to Hell. “You will have from Allah” meaning from His punishment “any protector” to prevent. “And he whom Allah sends astray, for him there is no guide.”
j-0927	“And Joseph had already come to you before,” that is, before Moses, and he is Joseph, son of Jacob, according to Omar, until the time of Moses, or Joseph, son of Abraham, son of Joseph, son of Jacob, according to another opinion, “with clear proofs,” with apparent miracles, “but you did not cease to be in doubt about what he brought you until, when he perished, you said,” without proof, “God will never send a messenger after him,” that is, you will not cease to disbelieve in Joseph and others. “Thus,” that is, like your misguidance, “God sends astray he who is a transgressor,” a polytheist, “in doubt,” doubtful about what the clear proofs testify to. “Those who dispute concerning the signs of God,” His miracles, subject, “without authority,” proof. “There has come to them arrogance,” their dispute is the predicate of the subject, “hateful to God and to those who believe. Thus,” like their misguidance, “God seals” with misguidance “upon every arrogant, tyrannical heart,” with the tanween of heart and below it. When the heart is arrogant, its companion is arrogant, and vice versa. Each of the two readings is for the generality of misguidance to all of the heart, not for the generality of the heart.
j-0928	"Pharaoh said, ""O Haman, build for me a tower that I may reach the ways."" ""The ways of the heavens"" are the paths leading to them.

Indeed, Allah has judged between His servants” so He will admit the believers into Paradise and the disbelievers into the Fire. “And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, “Call upon your Lord to lighten for us a day” that is, the amount of a day “of the punishment.” “They will say” that is, the keepers, mockingly, “Did not your messengers come to you with clear proofs” with apparent miracles? “They will say, “Yes” that is, they disbelieved in them. “They will say, “Then call upon” you, for we will not intercede for the disbelievers.” God Almighty says, “And the supplication of the disbelievers is only in error” nonexistence. “Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who believe during the life of this world, and on the Day when the witnesses will stand” plural of “witness” and they are the angels, they will testify for the messengers that they conveyed the message and against the disbelievers that they denied it. “On the Day when there will be no “The excuse of the wrongdoers will not benefit them” with the letters “ya” and “ta” “and for them is the curse” meaning distance from mercy “and for them is the worst home” the Hereafter meaning the severity of its punishment

“The blind and the seeing are not alike. Nor are those who believe and do righteous deeds” meaning the doer of good “nor the doer of evil.” There is an addition of “no.” “Little do they remember.” They are admonished with the letter “ya” and the letter “ta” meaning their remembrance is very little."
j-0932	“The Hour is coming, there is no doubt about it, but most people do not believe.” “And your Lord says, ‘Call upon Me; I will respond to you.’” That is, worship Me, and I will reward you, according to the evidence of what follows. “Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell, humbled.”

j-0934	“It is He who created you from dust” by creating your father Adam from it “then from a sperm-drop” semen “then from a clot” thick blood “then He brings you forth as a child” meaning children “then” He keeps you “that you may reach your full strength” the completion of your strength from thirty to forty years “then that you may be old men” with the damma or fatha of the shin “and among you is he who takes before” meaning before full strength and old age. He did that to you so that you may live “and that you may reach a specified term” a limited time “and that you may understand” the evidence of monotheism so that you may believe. “It is He who gives life and causes death. So when He decrees a matter” He wants to bring something into existence “He only says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is” with the damma or fatha of the nun, with the estimation that that is, it exists after the will which is the meaning of the aforementioned statement.

j-0936	“And We had certainly sent messengers before you, among them were those about whom We have told you, and among them were those about whom We have not told you.” It was narrated that God Almighty sent eight thousand prophets, four thousand prophets from the Children of Israel and four thousand from the rest of the people. “And it was not for a messenger” from among them “to bring a sign except by permission of God” because they were servants who were raised. “So when the command of God comes” with the punishment descending upon the disbelievers, “it will be judged” between the messengers and those who denied them “with truth, and there the falsifiers will lose” meaning that the judgment and loss will appear to the people, and they were losers at all times before that.

“So when they saw Our punishment,” meaning the severity of Our torment, “they said, ‘We believe in God alone and disbelieve in that which we used to associate with Him.’” “So their belief did not benefit them when they saw Our punishment. “That is the way of God,” the accusative case as a source with an implied verb from His word, “which has already occurred among His servants,” among the nations, that faith does not benefit them at the time of the punishment’s descent. “And there the disbelievers lost,” their loss became clear to everyone, and they were losers at every time before that."

He finished them in the last hour of it, and in them He created Adam, and that is why He did not say “equally,” and what is here is in agreement with the verses of the creation of the heavens and the earth in six days. “And He inspired in each heaven its command,” which He commanded those in it to do of obedience and worship. “And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps,” with stars, “and as protection,” accusative with its implied verb, that is, We protected it from the devils’ eavesdropping with meteors. “That is the decree of the Almighty,” in His kingdom, “the Knowing,” of His creation.

So we, in that with which you have been sent” according to your claim, “are disbelievers.” “As for ‘Aad, they were arrogant in the land without right and said” when they were frightened with the punishment “who is stronger than us in strength?” meaning no one among them could remove a huge rock from a mountain and place it wherever he wanted. “Did they not see” did they know “that God, who created them, was stronger than them in strength?” And they were denying Our signs” the miracles. “So We sent upon them a furious wind” cold, loud, without rain “during ill-fated days” with a broken ha’ And its stillness is ominous for them. “We will make them taste the punishment of disgrace” humiliation “in the life of this world.

In a reading with the hamza being brought forward “and if evil touches him, he is one of great supplication” much. “Say, ‘Have you considered, if it’ meaning the Qur’an “is from Allah” as the Prophet said “and then you disbelieved in it, who’” meaning no one ""More astray than he who is in dissension"" disagreement ""far"" from the truth.

The pronoun refers to humans and livestock in the dominant form. “There is nothing like Him” the “kaf” is redundant because He, the Most High, has no equal. “And He is the Hearing” of what is said, “The Seeing” of what He does. “To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth” that is, the keys to their treasuries of rain, plants, and other things. “He extends provision” He expands it “for whomever He wills” as a test. “And He restricts it” He constricts it for whomever He wills as a trial. “For He is Knowing of all things.”

j-0957	“And if Allah were to expand the provision for His servants,” all of them, “they would transgress,” all of them, “in the land, but He sends down,” with the alleviation and its opposite from provisions, “in measure as He wills,” so He expands it for some of His servants and not for others, and transgression arises from expansion. “Indeed, He is aware of His servants, seeing.” “And it is He who sends down the rain,” the rain, “after they have despaired,” they have despaired of its coming, “and spreads His mercy,” He spreads His rain, “and He is the Protector,” the Benefactor to the believers, “the Praiseworthy,” the One praised by them. “And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth,” He created, “and what He has dispersed,” separated and spread, “through them of creatures,” which are what creeps on the earth, from people and others. “And He is Able to gather them,” for the gathering, “when He wills,” in the pronoun, to make the rational person prevail over the other. “And whatever strikes you,” addressing the believers, “of disaster,” of affliction and hardship, “is for what your hands have earned,” that is, what you have earned of sins. He used the word “hands” because most actions are performed with them, “and He pardons much,” of them, so He does not punish for it, and He is God is too generous to double the reward in the Hereafter. As for the non-sinners, what befalls them in this world is to raise their degrees in the Hereafter. “And you will not escape” God by fleeing “on the earth” so that you will miss Him. “And you have no protector or helper besides God” that is, other than Him.
j-0958	"""And among His signs are the ships in the sea like mountains in size. If He wills, He can still the wind, and they remain stationary on its back. Indeed in that are signs for every patient and grateful believer, who is patient in hardship and grateful in ease. Or He destroys them, in apposition to He can still, meaning He drowns them with the wind’s blowing along with their families, “for what they have earned,” meaning their families of sins, “and pardons much,” so He does not drown His family. “And He knows,” in the nominative case, is a resumption, and in the accusative case, in apposition to an implied explanation, meaning He drowns them in order to take revenge on them and He knows, “those who dispute concerning Our verses will have no escape,” an escape from the punishment. The negative clause replaces the two objects of He knows, and the negative is dependent on the action. “So whatever you have been given,” addressing the believers and others, “of worldly furniture, is but the enjoyment of worldly life,” which is enjoyed in it and then disappears, “and what is with Allah,” of reward, “is better and more lasting for those who believe and upon their Lord is their Lord.” They trust in him and he is kind to him"
j-0959	“And those who avoid major sins and immoralities” the grounds for the prescribed punishments, by referring some to all, “and when they become angry, they forgive” they overlook. “And those who respond to their Lord” they respond to what He has called them to regarding monotheism and worship “and establish prayer” they maintain it “and their affair” that which appears to them “is consultation among themselves” they consult about it and do not rush “and from what We have provided them” we give them “they spend” in obedience to God and from the mentioned category. “And those who, when injustice befalls them” injustice “they take revenge” category, meaning they take revenge on the one who wronged them with the likeness of his injustice, as God Almighty said. “And the recompense for an evil is an evil like it” the second was called an evil because of its resemblance to the first in form, and this is apparent in what is retribution for wounds. Some of them said: And if he says to him, “May God disgrace you,” he responds to him, “May God disgrace you.” “But whoever pardons” his oppressor “and makes peace” the friendship between him and the one pardoned “his reward is with God” meaning that God will reward him, not It is impossible that “He does not love the wrongdoers” meaning those who initiate wrongdoing, so His punishment is due to them. “And whoever retaliates after his wrongdoing” meaning the wrongdoer’s wronging of him “for those there is no blame” accountability. “The blame is only against those who wrong people and rebel” who act “in the land without right” with sins “for those there is a painful punishment” painful. “And whoever is patient” does not retaliate “and forgives” overlooks “that” patience and overlooking “is for him who is determined on matters” meaning determined in the sense of what is required by the Shari’ah.
j-0960	“And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no protector after Him,” meaning no one to follow his guidance after Allah has led him astray. “And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, ‘Is there any way back?’” to this world. “And you will see them exposed to it,” meaning the Fire, “humbled,” fearful and humble, “from humiliation, looking” at it “from a hidden corner,” weak in sight, and “min” is the beginning or in the sense of “ba.” “And those who believe will say, ‘Indeed, the losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection,’” by being eternally in the Fire and not reaching the houris prepared for them in Paradise if they had believed. The relative pronoun is the predicate of “in.” “Unquestionably, the wrongdoers,” the disbelievers, “will be in a lasting punishment,” permanent, and it is from the action of Allah the Most High. “And they will have no protectors to aid them besides Allah,” meaning other than Him who repels His punishment from them. “And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no way,” a path to the truth in this world and to Paradise in the Hereafter.
j-0961	“Respond to your Lord” respond to Him with monotheism and worship “before there comes a Day” which is the Day of Resurrection “for which there is no repelling from Allah” meaning that if it comes, He will not reject it. “You will have no refuge” to resort to “that Day, nor will you have any denial” denial of your sins. “But if they turn away” from responding “then We have not sent you over them as a guardian” to preserve their actions by conforming to what is required of them. “Your duty is only to convey [the message]” and this is before the command to fight. “And indeed, when We let man taste mercy from Us” a blessing such as wealth and health, “we rejoice. But if evil” refers to man in terms of gender, “a calamity” “because of what their hands have put forth” meaning what they have put forth, and He used the word “hands” because most actions are performed with them “then indeed, man is ungrateful” for blessings. “To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He gives to whom He wills” of children “female children, and He gives to whom He wills males” “or He marries them” meaning He makes them “males and females, and He renders whom He wills barren” so that He does not He begets, but is not begotten. He is All-Knowing of what He creates, and All-Powerful over whatever He wills.

The Most High added, “He who made the earth a resting place for you,” a bed like a cradle for a child, “and made for you paths therein,” roads, “that you may be guided,” to your destinations in your travels. “And He who sent down water from the sky in measure,” that is, according to your need for it and did not send it down in a flood, “and We revived thereby a dead land. Thus you emerge,” that is, like this revival, “from your graves.” “And He who created all pairs and made for you of the ships,” the ships, “and the livestock,” such as camels, “on which you ride,” the pronoun was omitted for brevity, and it is in the genitive case in the first, that is, in the accusative case in the second. “That you may mount,” that you may rest, “on their backs,” the mention of the pronoun and the plural of the back in view of the word “what” and its meaning, “Then remember the favor of your Lord when you mount upon it and say, Glory be to Him who has subjected this to us, and we could never have subdued it.

He believed in him, then his parents believed, then his son Abd al-Rahman, and the son of Abd al-Rahman Abu Atiq. “Inspire me,” inspire me, “to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents,” which is monotheism, “and to do righteousness of which You approve,” so he freed nine believers who were being punished for the sake of God. “And make righteous for me in my offspring.” They are all believers. “Indeed, I have repented to You, and indeed, I am of the Muslims.” Those, that is, those who said this statement, Abu Bakr and others, from whom We accept the best, meaning the goodness of what they did, and overlook their misdeeds, are in the companions of Paradise, a state, that is, being in their entirety the promise of truth that they were promised in the words of God Almighty, “God has promised the believing men and believing women Gardens.” “And he who said to his parents,” and in a reading with assimilation, what is meant by it is the gender, “Uff,” with a kasra on the fa’ and a fatha on it, meaning a source, meaning foul and ugly, “for you both,” I am annoyed by you, “Do you promise me?” and in a reading with assimilation, “that I will come forth,” from the grave, “while the generations” the nations “have passed away before me,” and they did not come forth from the graves, “and they are calling upon God,” asking Him for help through his return, and they are saying, “If you do not return, woe to you,” meaning your destruction, meaning you are destroyed. “Believe,” in the resurrection, “for the promise of God is true.” He says, “This,” meaning the saying about the resurrection, “is nothing but legends of the ancients,” their lies. “Those are the ones upon whom the word,” of punishment, is due, “among nations that have passed away before them of the jinn.” And mankind - indeed, they were losers.
j-0994	“And for each” of the type of believer and disbeliever “are degrees” so the degrees of the believers in Paradise are high and the degrees of the disbelievers in Hell are low “for what they did” that is, the believers in acts of obedience and the disbelievers in acts of disobedience “and that He may fully recompense them” that is, God, and in a reading with a “nun” “for their deeds” that is, their recompense “and they will not be wronged” anything that will be reduced for the believers and increased for the disbelievers. “And on the Day those who disbelieved will be exposed to the Fire” that is, it will be revealed to them, it will be said, “Did you consume” with a hamza and two hamzas and with a hamza and a long vowel and with both of them and the facilitation of the second “your good things” by being occupied with your pleasures “in your worldly life and enjoying them” you enjoyed “them, so today you will be recompensed with the punishment of humiliation” that is, humiliation “for what you were arrogant” you were arrogant “on the earth without right and for what you were wicked” with it and you will be punished with it.
j-0995	"«And mention the brother of Aad» Hud, peace be upon him «when» etc. is a substitute for inclusion «he warned his people» frightening them «in Al-Ahqaf» a valley in Yemen where their homes were «and the warners had already passed» the messengers had passed «before him and behind him» that is, before Hud and after him to their people «that» that is, when he said «worship none but God» and the clause «had already passed» is parenthetical «indeed, I fear for you» if you worship other than God «the punishment of a tremendous Day». «They said, ""Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods» to turn us away from worshipping them «then bring us what you threaten us» of punishment for worshipping them «if you should be of the truthful» in that it will come to us». «He» Hud «said, «Knowledge is only with God» He is the One who knows when the punishment will come to you «and I will convey to you that with which I have been sent» to you «but I see that you are a people ignorant» in your hastening the punishment. «So when they saw it» that is, what the punishment was «appearing» a cloud appearing in the horizon of the sky «approaching their valleys, they said This is a rain cloud for us.” That is, it rains on us. God Almighty said, “Rather, it is that which you hastened” of the punishment. “A wind” instead of what “in which is a painful punishment” painful. “It destroys” it “everything” it passed over “by the command of its Lord” by His will, that is, everything He wanted to destroy with it, so it destroyed their men, women, children, and wealth by causing it to fly between the sky and the earth and tear it apart, and Hud and those who believed with him remained. “So they became nothing to be seen except their dwellings. Thus” as We rewarded them, “We reward the criminal people” other than them."
j-0996	“And We have certainly empowered them in that which We have empowered you in,” O people of Mecca, “of power and wealth, and We have given them hearing,” meaning hearings, “and sight and hearts,” hearts, “but their hearing, sight and hearts availed them not at all,” meaning at all of enrichment, and “from” is an extra “when,” the object of “enriched” and “drink” has the meaning of explanation, “they used to deny the signs of God,” His clear proofs, “and that which they used to ridicule” befell them, meaning the punishment. “And We have certainly destroyed the towns around you,” meaning of their people, such as Thamud, ‘Aad and the people of Lot, “and We have repeatedly revealed the signs,” We repeated the clear proofs, “that perhaps they might return.” “Why,” why, “why did not those who took besides God, other than Him, as offerings,” seeking to draw near to God, “gods,” with Him, and they are the idols, and the first object of “took” is an omitted pronoun. It refers to the relative pronoun, that is, they and the second offering and the gods instead of it. “Rather, they went astray” they disappeared “from them” when the punishment descended. “And that” that is, their taking the idols as gods as offerings “was their slander” their lie “and what they used to invent” they lie. “And what” is a source or relative pronoun and the pronoun is omitted, that is, in it.
j-0997	And remember when We directed Our hope to you, a group of the jinn, the jinn of Nasibin in Yemen, or the jinn of Nineveh, and they were seven or nine, and the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was in Batn Nakhl, leading his companions in the dawn prayer. Narrated by the two sheikhs, listening to the Qur’an. When they attended to him, they said, that is, some of them said to each other, “Listen, listen to him.” When he finished reciting it, they turned back and returned to their people, warning and frightening their people with the punishment if they did not believe. They were Jews who had become Muslims. “They said, ‘O our people, indeed we have heard a Book,’ meaning the Qur’an, ‘revealed after Moses, confirming what was before it,’ meaning that it preceded it, like the Torah. ‘It guides to the truth,’ meaning Islam, ‘and to a straight path,’ meaning its path. ‘O our people, respond to the caller of Allah,’ Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, to faith, ‘and believe in it. He will forgive you some of your sins,’ meaning some of them, because injustices are not forgiven except with the consent of their perpetrators, ‘and will save you from a painful punishment. ’ And whoever does not respond to the caller of Allah will not escape [Allah] on earth. ’” That is, God is not helpless by escaping from Him, so that He escapes. “And there is no help for him” for those who do not respond “besides Him” that is, God. “Those” who did not respond “are in manifest error” clearly.
j-0998	“Have they not seen” meaning the deniers of the resurrection “that God, who created the heavens and the earth and was not weary of their creation” is not unable to do so “is able” is the predicate of “that” and the “ba” was added to it because the speech is about power, is not God able “to bring the dead to life? Yes” He is able to bring the dead to life “Indeed, He is over all things competent.” “And on the Day those who disbelieved will be exposed to the Fire” to be tormented with it, it will be said to them, “Is this” the torment “not the truth?” They will say, “Yes, by our Lord.” He will say, “Then taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve.” So be patient with the harm of your people as the resolute ones, the steadfast and patient ones, were patient with the hardships of the messengers before you, so you will be resolute. “Min” is for clarification, so they are all resolute. It was said for partiality, so Adam was not among them, according to the Most High’s statement, “And we did not find in him any resoluteness,” nor was Jonah, according to the Most High’s statement, “And do not be like the companion of the fish, and do not hasten for them, for your people, the punishment to descend upon them.” It was said as if he was bored with them and loved the punishment to descend upon them, so he commanded patience and not hastening the punishment, for it will inevitably descend. As if, on the Day they see what they are promised of punishment in the Hereafter, because of its length, they had not remained in this world, in their opinion, except for an hour of a day. This Qur’an is a message from God to you. So are none destroyed upon seeing the punishment except the wicked people, that is, the disbelievers?
j-0999	“Those who disbelieved” from the people of Mecca “and averted” others “from the way of Allah” that is, faith “He has led astray” nullified “their deeds” such as feeding the poor and maintaining family ties, so they will not see any reward for them in the Hereafter, and they will be rewarded for them in this world from His bounty, the Most High. “And those who believed” that is, the Ansar and others “and did righteous deeds and believed in what was revealed to Muhammad” that is, the Qur’an “and it is the truth from their Lord, He will remove from them” forgive them “their misdeeds and amend their condition” their condition so they will not disobey Him. “That” that is, the misguidance of deeds and the expiation of misdeeds “is because” because “those who disbelieved followed falsehood” the devil “and those who believed followed the truth” the Qur’an “from their Lord. Thus” that is, like that statement “Allah sets forth for mankind their examples” He explains their conditions, that is, the disbeliever’s deeds are rendered null and the believer is forgiven. “So when you meet those who disbelieve, strike [their] necks” is a source instead of the word with its action, that is, strike their necks, that is, kill them. He used the phrase “strike [their] necks” because killing is usually By striking the neck “until you have inflicted heavy casualties on them” you have killed many of them “then tighten” so you hold back from them and take them captive and tighten “the bonds” with which the captives are bound “then either a favor after” a source in place of the word with its action, meaning you grant them a favor by releasing them without anything “or ransom” you redeem them with money or Muslim captives “until the war” meaning its people “lays down its burdens” its heavy weapons and other things by the infidels surrendering or entering into the covenant, and this is the end of killing and capturing “that” the predicate of an implied subject, meaning the matter with them is what was mentioned “and if Allah had willed, He could have taken revenge on them” without fighting “but” He commanded you with it “that He may test some of you by means of others” of them in the fighting, so that whoever among you is killed will go to Paradise and some of them to Hell “and those who were killed” and in the reading they fought, the verse was revealed on the day of Uhud when killing and wounding had become widespread among the Muslims “in the way of Allah - He will never go astray” nullify “their deeds” “He will guide them” in this world and the hereafter to what benefits them “and amend their condition” their state In them and in the world for those who were not killed and were included in the killed by force. “And He will admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them,” He explained, “for them,” so they are guided to their dwellings from it and their wives and servants without any guidance.

So know that there is no god but Allah, meaning blood, O Muhammad, for your knowledge of that which is beneficial on the Day of Resurrection, and seek forgiveness for your sin because of it He was told this despite his infallibility so that his nation would follow his example, and he did so. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: “I seek God’s forgiveness a hundred times every day. And for the believing men and women, there is an honor for them in it by ordering their Prophet to seek forgiveness for them. And God knows your movements and your actions, your occupations during the day and your resting place, your place of refuge and your beds at night.” That is, He is aware of all your conditions, nothing of them is hidden from Him, so beware of Him.

j-1010	Those who pledge allegiance to you, the Pledge of Ridwan at Hudaybiyyah, are only pledging allegiance to Allah. This is similar to one who obeys the Messenger, for Allah has obeyed. The hand of Allah is above their hands with which they pledged allegiance to the Prophet, meaning that He, the Most High, is aware of their pledge of allegiance and will reward them for it. So whoever breaks the pledge of allegiance, he only breaks it and the consequences of his breach will come back upon himself. And whoever fulfills what he has pledged to Allah, He will give him, with the letter Ya and the letter Noon, a great reward. “The bedouins who stayed behind will say to you,” around Medina, meaning those whom Allah left behind from accompanying you when you asked them to go with you to Mecca for fear of the Quraysh’s attack on you in the year of Hudaybiyyah if you returned from it, “Our wealth and our families have distracted us,” from going out with you, “so ask forgiveness for us,” from Allah for not going out with you. Allah, the Most High, said, belying them, “They say with their tongues,” meaning from asking for forgiveness and what came before it, “that which is not in their hearts,” so they are lying in their apology. “Say, ‘Then who’” is an interrogative with the meaning of negation, meaning no one “can possess for you anything from Allah if He intended for you harm,” with the letter Dad open and closed, “or intended for you benefit, but rather…” God is All-Aware of what you do.” That is, He has always been described as such. “Rather,” in the two subjects of the transition from one purpose to another, “you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, and that was made attractive in your hearts.” That is, that they would be uprooted by killing and never return. “And you thought an evil thought.” This and other things. “And you were a people who perished.” The plural of “perished,” that is, “destroyed” in the sight of God because of this thought. “And whoever does not believe in God and His Messenger, then indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers a Blaze.” A severe Fire.
j-1011	“And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And God is Forgiving and Merciful.” That is, He has always been described as mentioned. “Those who stayed behind” those mentioned “will say, when you speak about the spoils” that is, the spoils of Khaybar “to take them, ‘Leave us’” leave us “and we will follow you’ so that we may take from them. “They want” with that “to change the word of God” and in the reading of the word of God with a kasra on the lam, that is, His promises regarding the spoils of Khaybar, specifically the people of Hudaybiyyah. “Say, ‘You will not follow us. Thus did God say before’” that is, before our return. “And they will say, ‘Rather, you envy us’” that we share with you from the spoils, so you said that. “Rather, they did not understand’ of the religion “except a little’” of them.
j-1012	“Say to the desert Arabs who stayed behind,” mentioned as a test, “You will be called to fight a people of great strength,” it was said that they were the Banu Hanifa, the people of Yamamah, and it was said that they were the Persians and the Romans. “You will fight them,” a predicate that is understood to be what is being called to in meaning, “or they will submit,” so you will not fight. “If you obey,” to fight them, “Allah will give you a good reward. But if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment.” “There is no blame upon the blind, nor upon the lame, nor upon the sick,” in abandoning jihad. “And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, He will admit him,” with the letter ya and the letter nun, “to gardens beneath which rivers flow. And whoever turns away, He will punish him,” with the letter ya and the letter nun, “with a painful punishment.”
j-1013	"“Allah was pleased with the believers when they pledged allegiance to you” at Hudaybiyyah “under the tree” which was a samura tree and they were one thousand and three hundred or more. Then he pledged allegiance to them to fight Quraysh and not to flee from death. “So He knew” Allah “what was in their hearts” of sincerity and loyalty “so He sent down tranquility upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest” which was the conquest of Khaybar after their departure from Hudaybiyyah

“and great spoils which they would take” from Khaybar “and Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise” that is, He has always been characterized by that

“Allah promised you abundant spoils which you would take” from the conquests “so He hastened this for you” the spoils of Khaybar “and restrained the hands of the people from you” from your families when you left and the Jews intended to attack them, so Allah cast terror into their hearts “and that it may be” that is, the hastened is in apposition to the implied, that is, so that you would thank Him “a sign for the believers” in their victory “and guide you to a straight path” that is, the path of trusting in Him and entrusting the matter to Him, the Most High

“and another” is a description of the spoils The subject is estimated. “You were not able to do it.” It is from Persia and Rome. “Allah has encompassed it.” He knew that it would be yours. “And Allah is over all things competent.” That is, He has always been characterized by that. “And if those who disbelieve fought you” at Al-Hudaibiyah “they would turn their backs and then they would find neither a protector nor a helper.” “The way of Allah” is a source confirming the content of the sentence before it of the defeat of the disbelievers and the victory of the believers. That is, the way of Allah is the way “that has passed before. And you will not find any change in the way of Allah.”"
j-1014	“And it is He who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca” at Al-Hudaybiyyah “after He had given you victory over them” for eighty of them had gone around your army to kill some of you, so they were captured and brought to the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, so he pardoned them and set them free, and that was the reason for the peace. “And God is Seeing of what they do” with the letter “ya” and the letter “ta” meaning He has always been described as such. “They are the ones who disbelieved and prevented you from the Sacred Mosque” meaning from reaching it “and the sacrificial animals” is connected to “how much” “restricted” as a state “from reaching their place” meaning the place where it is usually slaughtered, which is the Haram, as a substitute for inclusion. “And had it not been for believing men and believing women” present in Mecca with the disbelievers “you would not have known them” with the characteristic of faith “that you would trample them” meaning that you would kill them with the disbelievers if you had been permitted to conquer, as a substitute for inclusion of them “so that a disgrace would have befallen you from them” meaning a sin “without your knowledge” of it. The third-person pronouns refer to both groups with the males being predominant, and the answer to “if it had not been for” is omitted, meaning “If you were to be permitted to conquer, but permission was not given at that time, “that Allah might admit into His mercy whom He wills,” such as the believers mentioned. “If you had separated,” distinguished yourself from the disbelievers, “We would have punished those who disbelieved among them,” of the people of Mecca at that time by giving you permission to conquer it, “with a painful punishment,” painful. “When He placed” related to “We punished” “those who disbelieved” the subject, “in their hearts the fanaticism,” the arrogance of something, “the fanaticism of ignorance,” instead of the fanaticism, which is their preventing the Prophet and his companions from the Sacred Mosque. “So Allah sent down His tranquility upon the Messenger and upon the believers,” so they made peace with them on the condition that they would return the next year, and they were not afflicted with the fanaticism that afflicted the disbelievers until they fought them. “And He made them obliged,” meaning the believers, “to adhere to the word of piety,” “There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah,” and it was added to piety because it is its cause. “And they were more deserving of it,” of the word than the disbelievers. “And its people,” an explanatory conjunction. “And Allah is Knowing of all things,” meaning He has always been fair about that, and it is known that they are its people.
j-1015	“Allah has fulfilled the vision of His Messenger with truth.” The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, saw in a dream in the year of Al-Hudaybiyyah before his departure that he and his companions would enter Mecca in safety, shaving and cutting their hair. He informed his companions of that, and they were happy. When they went out with him and the infidels stopped them at Al-Hudaybiyyah and returned, and that was difficult for them, and some of the hypocrites were afraid, this was revealed. His saying “with truth” is related to the truth or state of the vision and what comes after it is its interpretation. “You will surely enter the Sacred Mosque, Allah willing,” to seek blessings, “in safety, with your heads shaved,” that is, all of its hair, “and cutting” some of its hair, and these are two implied states, “fearing nothing,” ever. “He knew,” in the peace treaty, “that which you did not know,” of righteousness, “and He made, beyond that,” that is, entering, “an imminent conquest,” that is, the conquest of Khaybar. The vision was fulfilled the following year. “It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it,” that is, the religion of truth, “over all religion,” over all other religions. “And sufficient is Allah as Witness,” that you are sent with what was mentioned, as Allah the Most High said. “Muhammad.” Subject: “The Messenger of God” is its predicate, and those with him” that is, his companions from the believers are subject and predicate “are harsh” harsh “against the disbelievers” they do not have mercy on them “and merciful among themselves” is a second predicate, that is, sympathetic and affectionate like a father with his son “you see them” you see them “bow and prostrate” two states “seek” a new sentence they seek “bounty from God and approval. Their mark” their mark is subject “is in their faces” its predicate, which is light and whiteness by which they are known in the Hereafter that they prostrated in this world “from the traces of prostration” related to what the predicate is related to, that is, it is present and it is construed as a state of its pronoun transferred to the predicate “that” the aforementioned description “their example” their description is subject “in the Torah” its predicate “and their example in the Gospel” subject and predicate “is like a seed that sends forth its shoot” with a sukoon on the ta’ and a fatha on it, “its young shoots are strengthened” with a long and short vowel, he strengthens it and aids it “so it becomes thick” thick “and stands straight” strong and straight “on its stalk” its roots are the plural of stalk “The farmers are amazed” meaning his farming is beautiful, like the Companions, may God be pleased with them, because they started out few and weak, then increased and became strong in the best way, “so that He may enrage the disbelievers with them” is related to an omitted word indicated by what preceded it, meaning they were likened to that, “God has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them” the Companions and “those” to indicate the type, not to indicate the partiality, because they are all with the mentioned characteristic, “forgiveness and a great reward” Paradise, and they are also for those who come after them in verses.
j-1016	“O you who have believed, do not advance” from qadamm means to advance, i.e. do not advance in word or deed “before Allah and His Messenger” the one being conveyed, i.e. without their permission, “and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Hearing” of your words, “Knowing” of your actions. It was revealed regarding the argument between Abu Bakr and Umar, may Allah be pleased with them, before the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about appointing Al-Aqra’ bin Habis or Al-Qa’qa’ bin Ma’bad as his successor. It was revealed regarding those who raised their voices before the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace. “O you who have believed, do not raise your voices” when you speak “above the voice of the Prophet” when he speaks “and do not be loud to him in speech” when you talk privately to him “like the loudness of some of you to others” rather less than that out of reverence for him “lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not” i.e. fearing that by raising and raising the voice mentioned, and it was revealed regarding those who lowered their voices before the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, like Abu Bakr and Umar and others, may Allah be pleased with them. “Indeed, those who lower their voices before the Messenger of Allah - those are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for piety” i.e. to make clear “to them.” Forgiveness and a great reward” Paradise. It was revealed about a people who came at noon while the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, was in his house and called out to him. “Those who call to you from behind the chambers” The chambers of his wives, may God bless him and grant him peace, are the plural of “chamber” which is the part of the earth that is protected by a wall or the like. Each one of them called out behind a chamber because they did not know in which chamber he was calling the Bedouins with harshness and rudeness. “Most of them do not understand” in what they did, your high position and what is appropriate for it of glorification. “And if they had been patient” that they are in the nominative case as a subject, and it was said that it is the subject of an implied verb, meaning they remained steadfast. “Until you came out to them, it would have been better for them. And God is Forgiving and Merciful” to those of them who repented. It was revealed about Al-Walid bin Uqbah, and the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, sent him to Banu Al-Mustaliq to collect the alms tax. He feared them because of a dispute that had occurred between him and them in the pre-Islamic period, so he returned and said that they had refused to pay the alms tax and intended to kill him. The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, intended to attack them, but they came denying what he had said about them.
j-1017	"“O you who have believed, if there comes to you a wicked person with information, verify it, whether it is true or false. In another reading, “be certain” from “steadfastness,” “lest you harm a people” is an object for it, i.e. fearing that, “in ignorance,” a state of the subject, i.e. ignorant, “and become, over what you have done,” of wronging the people, “regretful.” And the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, sent Khalid to them after their return to their country, and he saw nothing in them except obedience and goodness, so he informed the Prophet of that. “And know that among you is the Messenger of God,” so do not say falsehood, for God informs him of the situation. “If he were to obey you in much of the matter,” which you are informed of contrary to reality, so that its requirement would be established, “you would be cursed,” for you would sin less than him, the sin of causing what is established. “But God has endeared faith to you and has made it pleasing,” making it beautiful, “in your hearts, and has made disbelief, wickedness, and disobedience hateful to you,” an addition in meaning but not in wording, because the one to whom faith is endeared, etc., is different in description from the one mentioned previously. “Those are they,” in it. A shift from the address “the rightly guided ones” who are steadfast in their religion
“Blessing from God” a noun in the accusative case with its implied verb, meaning better “and a blessing” from Him “and God is Knowing” of them “Wise” in His blessings upon them"
j-1018	“And if two parties among the believers” the verse was revealed in a case in which the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, rode a donkey and passed by Ibn Ubayy, and the donkey urinated and Ibn Ubayy’s nose was blocked, so Ibn Rawahah said, “By God, the urine of his donkey has a better scent than musk,” so there was a clash between their people with hands, sandals, and palm fronds. “They will fight,” the plural is used in view of the meaning, because each party is a group, and it was read “they fought,” “then make peace between them,” the dual is used in view of the wording. “But if one of them transgresses against the other, then fight against the one that transgresses until it returns to the command of God,” the truth. “But if it returns, then make peace between them with justice,” with fairness, “and act justly,” “for God loves those who act justly.” “The believers are but brothers,” in religion. “So make peace between your two brothers,” if they quarrel, and it was read “your brothers” with the upper form, “and fear God that you may receive mercy.”
j-1019	“O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule” the verse was revealed about the delegation of Tamim when they ridiculed the poor Muslims like Ammar and Suhaib. Ridicule is contempt and disdain “a people” i.e. men among you “of a people who may be better than them” in the sight of God “nor women” among you “of women who may be better than them. And do not insult one another” do not criticize one another so that one finds fault with another, i.e. do not criticize one another “and do not call one another by nicknames” do not call one another by nicknames that one dislikes, such as “O wicked one” or “O disbeliever.” “Evil is the name” i.e. what is mentioned of ridicule, slander, and name-calling “Islam after faith” instead of the name that it is immorality because it is usually repeated. “And whoever does not repent” from that “then those are the wrongdoers.” “O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumption is sin” i.e., sinful, and it is common, such as thinking ill of the good people among the believers, and they are common, unlike the wicked among them, so there is no sin in it in something that appears from them. “And do not spy” one of them was omitted. The two ta’s: Do not pursue the faults and shortcomings of Muslims by searching for them. “And do not backbite one another.” Do not mention something that you dislike, even if it is in him. “Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother when he is dead?” with the emphasis and the emphasis, meaning that he would not do well with him. “You would hate it.” Backbiting him during his life is like eating his flesh after his death. The second was presented to you, so you hated it, so hate the first. “And fear Allah.” That is, His punishment for backbiting by repenting from it. “Indeed, Allah is Forgiving.” He accepts the repentance of those who repent. “Merciful.” “O mankind, indeed We have created you from a male and a female.” Adam and Eve. “And made you peoples.” The plural of “people” with the opening of the shin is the highest level of lineage. “And tribes.” They are below peoples. After them are the buildings, then the clans, then the thighs, then the factions. The last one is an example of Khuzaymah, the people of Kinanah, the tribe of Quraysh. Amara with the breaking of the ‘ayn, Qusayy, the clan of Hashim, the clan of Abbas, a faction. “That you may know one another.” One of the two ta’s was deleted from it so that you may know one another, not to boast of high lineage, but rather boasting is in piety. “Indeed, The most honorable of you in the sight of God is the most righteous of you. Indeed, God is All-Knowing of you and All-Aware of your innermost thoughts.
j-1020	“The Bedouins said,” a group of Banu Asad, “We believe,” we believed in our hearts. “Say,” to them, “You have not believed, but say, ‘We have submitted,’ outwardly, ‘and faith has not yet entered your hearts,’ but it is expected of you. “And if you obey Allah and His Messenger,” with faith and other things, “He will not withhold from you,” with the hamza and without it and by replacing it with an alif, it will not diminish you “in anything of your deeds,’ that is, in their reward. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving,” to the believers, “Merciful,” to them. “The believers,” that is, those who are sincere in their faith, as He stated later, “are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then have not doubted,” have not doubted their faith, “and have striven with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah,” so their striving is evident in the sincerity of their faith. “Those are the truthful,” in their faith, not those who said, “We believe,” and there was nothing from them other than Islam. “Say,” to them, “Do you teach Allah about your religion?” The doubled form of knowledge means feeling, that is, do you make Him feel what you are upon in your saying, “We believe,” “and Allah knows what you are upon.” In the heavens and on the earth, and God is Knowing of all things. “They do you a favor by submitting” without fighting, unlike others who submitted after fighting among them. “Say, ‘Do not do me a favor by your submission’” is in the accusative case, with the preposition “ba” removed, and it is understood before “an” in both places. “Rather, God does you a favor by guiding you to faith, if you should be truthful” in your saying “we have believed.” “Indeed, God knows the unseen of the heavens and the earth,” that is, what is hidden in them. “And God is Seeing of what they do” with the “ya” and the “ta”; nothing of it is hidden from Him.

“Or does man” that is, every human being among them “have what he desires” that idols intercede for them? This is not the case.

“To Allah belongs the Hereafter and the first” that is, the world, so nothing happens in them except what Allah the Most High wants.

“And how many angels” that is, and many angels in the heavens, and how honorable they are in the sight of Allah, their intercession does not avail at all except after Allah gives them permission in it for whomever He wills of His servants and is pleased with, according to His saying, “And they do not intercede except for whom He is pleased with.” And it is known that they do not exist from them except after permission in it, “Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission?”

“Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter call the angels by female names” where they said they are the daughters of Allah.

“And they have no knowledge therein” with this statement, “that they follow” in it “except conjecture” which they imagined “and conjecture avails nothing against the truth” that is, about knowledge in what knowledge is required in.

“So turn away from whoever turns away from Our remembrance” that is, the Qur’an. “And he desired nothing but the life of this world.” This was before the command to wage jihad. “That,” meaning seeking this world, “is the extent of their knowledge,” meaning the end of their knowledge, if they preferred this world over the Hereafter. “Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is guided.” He knows them both, so He will reward them."

And He distinguished the doers of good by saying: “Those who avoid the major sins and immoralities, except for minor sins.” That is, minor sins such as a glance, a kiss, and a touch. It is an isolated exception, and the meaning is that minor sins are forgiven by avoiding major sins. “Indeed, your Lord is Vast in forgiveness” by that and by accepting repentance. It was revealed about those who used to say, “Our prayer, our fasting, our pilgrimage.” “He is most knowing” that is, He knows “of you when He created you from the earth” that is, He created your father Adam from dust. “And when you were fetuses” the plural of fetus “in the wombs of your mothers. So do not praise yourselves” do not praise yourselves out of admiration. As for acknowledging the blessing, that is good. “He is most knowing” that is, He knows “who fears Him.” ""Have you seen him who turned away?"" from the faith, he turned back when he was reproached with it and said, ""Indeed, I feared the punishment of Allah."" So the one who reproached him guaranteed that he would bear the punishment of Allah for him if he returned to his polytheism and gave him so much of his money, so he returned. ""And he gave a little"" of the specified money, ""and he made it difficult"", he withheld the rest, taken from the word ""kadiyya"", which is a hard ground like a rock that prevents the digger of a well from digging if he reaches it. ""Does he have knowledge of the unseen, so he sees?"" He knows, in its entirety, that someone else will bear the punishment of the Hereafter for him, and he is not Al-Walid bin Al-Mughira or someone else. The phrase ""do ...

""And the scriptures of Abraham, who fulfilled what he was commanded, such as, ""And when Abraham was tested by his Lord with words, so he fulfilled them"" and the explanation of what
""A"" ""No soul shall bear the burden of another"" etc. And ""an"" is a lightened form of the heavy one, meaning that no soul shall bear the sin of another. ""And that"" that ""man shall have nothing but what he strives for"" of good, so he has no striving for anyone else. Good is something

And the people of Noah before, that is, before ‘Ad and Thamud, We destroyed them. Indeed, they were more unjust and more rebellious than ‘Ad and Thamud, due to the length of Noah’s stay among them. He stayed among them for a thousand years minus fifty years, and despite their disbelief in him, they harmed him and beat him

""We saved them at dawn"" from the early hours of the morning at dawn on an unspecified day. If it had been intended from a specific day, it would have been prevented from being declined because it is a definite noun modified from ""sahr"" because its right is to be used in the definite article with the definite article. And whether the storm was sent upon the family of Lot first is two opinions. The exception is expressed in the first as connected and in the second as disconnected, even if it is from the same type, they allow it. ""A blessing"" is a source, meaning a favor ""from Us thus"" meaning like that reward ""We reward whoever is grateful"" We bestowed favors and he is a believer or whoever believed in God and His Messenger and obeyed them. ""And indeed, Lot warned them"" their fear of ""Our punishment"" Our punishment of them ""so they disputed"" they argued and denied ""the warning"" his warning.

j-1048	“Your disbelievers,” O Quraysh, “are better than those,” those mentioned from the people of Noah to Pharaoh, so they were not excused. “Or do you,” O Quraysh disbelievers, “have immunity” from the punishment “in the scriptures”? The books. The question in both places has the meaning of negation, meaning that the matter is not like that. “Or do they say,” meaning the Quraysh disbelievers, “We are all,” the plural, “victorious,” over Muhammad? And when Abu Jahl said on the day of Badr, “We are all a victorious group,” it was revealed. “The army will be defeated and they will turn their backs,” so they were defeated at Badr, and the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace, was victorious over them. “Rather, the Hour is their appointed time,” with the punishment. “And the Hour,” meaning its punishment, “is more terrible,” a greater affliction, “and more bitter,” more bitter than the punishment of this world.

""Know that the life of this world is but play and amusement and adornment"" adornment ""and boasting to one another and competition in wealth and children"" meaning preoccupation with it, and as for the acts of obedience and what helps with them from the matters of the Hereafter, ""like"" meaning it is in its admiration for you and its disappearance like ""rain"" “The disbelievers are amazed” by the farmer “by its plant” that grows from him “then it withers” “and you see it yellow, then it becomes debris” crumbs that are destroyed by the winds “and in the Hereafter is a severe punishment” for those who prefer the world over it “and forgiveness from Allah and approval” for those who do not prefer the world over it “and what is the life of this world” what is the enjoyment in it “but the enjoyment of delusion” “Race one another toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heaven and the earth” if you were to connect one of them to the other and the width is spaciousness “prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That is the bounty of Allah which He bestows upon whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.”"
j-1072	“No disaster strikes upon the earth” such as drought “or among yourselves” such as illness or the loss of a child “except that it is in a register” meaning the Preserved Tablet “before We bring it into being” We create it. This is also said of a blessing “that is easy for Allah” “so that you will not” kay is a verb accusative in the sense that, that is, Allah informed us of that so that you will not “regret” grieve “over what has escaped you and do not rejoice” joy is arrogance but rather joy is gratitude for the blessing “over what He has given you” with the long vowel “He gave you” and with the short vowel “He brought you from Him” “and Allah does not like anyone self-deluded” arrogant about what he has been given “boasting” over it to people. “And those who are stingy” with what is due to them “and enjoin stinginess on people” with it, there is a severe warning for them. “And whoever turns away” from what is due to him “then indeed, Allah is” a disjunctive pronoun and in a reading with its omission “the Rich” from others “the Praiseworthy” for His friends.
j-1073	“We have sent Our messengers” the angels to the prophets “with clear proofs” with decisive arguments “and sent down with them the Scripture” meaning the books “and the balance” justice “that people may maintain justice. And We sent down iron” We extracted it from minerals “in which is great force” with which to fight “and benefits for people and that Allah may know” knowledge of observation conjoined with “that people may maintain” “who will support Him” by supporting His religion with weapons of war of iron and other things “and His Messenger in the unseen” a state of the “ha” of “supporting Him” meaning absent from them in this world. Ibn Abbas said that they support him but they do not see him “Indeed Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might” He has no need for support, but it benefits whoever brings it. “And We sent Noah and Abraham and placed among their descendants prophethood and the Scripture” meaning the four books, the Torah, the Gospel, the Psalms and the Criterion, for they are among the descendants of Abraham “and among them is [rightly] guided, but many of them are wicked.” “Then We followed up on their footsteps with Our messengers and followed up with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel and placed in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy and monasticism” which is rejection. Women and the taking of monasteries “they invented it” of their own accord “We did not prescribe it for them” We did not command them to do it “except” but they did it “seeking the pleasure” of “Allah. But they did not observe it with its right observance” since many of them abandoned it and disbelieved in the religion of Jesus and entered the religion of their king, and many of them remained in the religion of Jesus and believed in our Prophet “so We gave those who believed” in him “among them their reward, and many of them are wicked.”
j-1074	“O you who have believed,” in Jesus, “fear God and believe in His Messenger,” Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, and Jesus, “He will give you a double portion,” two shares, “of His mercy,” for your belief in the prophets, “and make for you a light by which you will walk,” on the path, “and forgive you. And God is Forgiving and Merciful.” “So that he will not know,” that is, He informed you of this so that “the People of the Scripture,” in the Torah who did not believe in Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “that” the lightened form of the heavy one, and its subject is the pronoun of the matter, and the meaning is that “they have no power over anything of the bounty of God,” contrary to what they claim that they are beloved of God and people of His pleasure, “and that bounty is in the hand of God. He gives it,” He gives it, “to whom He wills,” so He gave the believers among them their reward twice, as mentioned above, “and God is the possessor of great bounty.”
j-1075	"""Allah has heard the statement of the one who argues with you"" who argues with you, O Prophet ""concerning her husband"" who has made zihar with her. He had said to her, ""You are to me like the back of my mother."" She asked the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, about that, and he answered her that she was forbidden to him according to what is customary among them, that zihar results in permanent separation. She is Khawlah bint Tha'labah, who is Aws ibn al-Samit. ""And she complains to Allah"" of her loneliness and poverty and of young children who, if she takes them to him, will be lost or they will starve to him. ""And Allah hears your dialogue"" your arguments. ""Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing."" Knowing. ""Those who zihar"" its original form is yatazaharun. The ta' was assimilated into the dhaad. In another reading it is with an alif between the dhaad and the light ha'. In another it is kayqatalun, and the second instance is the same. ""Of you, from their women, they are not their mothers. Their mothers are none but those"" with a hamza and a ya' and without a ya' ""who gave birth to them. And indeed, they"" with zihar ""are sure to say something reprehensible and false."" A lie. ""And indeed, Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving."" ""And those who swear off their women and then They return to what they said, that is, in it, by contradicting it by keeping the one who pronounces zihar from her, which is contrary to the purpose of zihar, which is describing the woman as forbidden. “Then the freeing of a slave,” that is, her emancipation upon him, “before they touch each other,” by intercourse. “That is what you are admonished to do. And God is Acquainted with what you do.” “But whoever cannot find” a slave, “then a fast of two consecutive months before they touch each other. But whoever is unable,” that is, fasting, “then the feeding of sixty poor persons,” upon him, that is, before they touch each other, applying the general to the restricted, for each poor person a mudd of the country’s staple food. “That,” that is, the lightening of the expiation, “is so that you may believe in God and His Messenger. And those,” that is, the rulings mentioned, “are the limits set by God, and for the disbelievers,” in them, “is a painful punishment.”"
j-1076	“Indeed, those who oppose” oppose “Allah and His Messenger will be humbled” humiliated “as those before them were humbled” in their opposition to their messengers. “And We have sent down clear signs” indicating the truthfulness of the Messenger. “And for the disbelievers” in the signs “is a humiliating punishment” of humiliation. “On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did. Allah has enumerated it, while they forgot it. And Allah is Witness over all things.”
j-1077	“Have you not seen that Allah knows what is in the heavens and what is on the earth? There is not a secret conversation between three but He is their fourth, nor between five but He is their sixth, nor less than that nor more but He is with them wherever they are. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things.” “Have you not seen those who were forbidden to secretly talk, then they return to what they were forbidden from and confer about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger, doubt. And when they come to you, they greet you, O Prophet, with that with which Allah has not greeted you, and they say to themselves, “Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?” of greeting and that he is not a prophet if he is a prophet. “Sufficient for them is Hell, which they will burn in, and wretched is the destination.” “O you who have believed, when you confer privately, do not confer about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger, but confer about righteousness and piety. And fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered.” “The secret conversation” about sin and the like “is only from Satan.” With his arrogance, “He will grieve those who believe, but he will not harm them at all except by the permission of God,” that is, by his will. “And upon God let the believers put their trust.”
j-1078	“O you who have believed, when you are told, ‘Make room’ in the assembly,” the assembly of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and the remembrance, even the assembly of those who come to you. In a reading of the assemblies, “then make room; God will make room for you,” in Paradise. “And when it is said, ‘Rise,’ rise for prayer and other good deeds, then rise.” In a reading with a damma on the shin in both of them, “God will raise those who have believed among you,” through obedience in that, “and raise those who have been given knowledge, by degrees,” in Paradise. “And God is Acquainted with what you do.”
j-1079	“O you who have believed, when you confer privately with the Messenger,” meaning to converse with him, “then offer charity before your private conversation. That is better for you and purer,” for your sins. “But if you cannot find,” for your private conversation, “then indeed, Allah is Forgiving,” for your private conversation, “and Merciful,” meaning, then there is no blame upon you for conversing without charity. Then this was abrogated by His statement, “Did you fear,” by realizing the two hamzas and replacing the second with an alif and making it easy, and inserting an alif between the easy one and the other and leaving it, meaning, did you fear “that you would offer charity before your private conversation,” due to poverty. “But if you do not,” charity, “and Allah has turned to you in forgiveness,” He turns you back from it, “then establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger,” meaning, persist in that, “and Allah is Acquainted with what you do.”
j-1080	"«Have you not seen» you look «at those who turned back» they are the hypocrites «a people» they are the Jews «upon whom is the wrath of Allah? They are not» the hypocrites «from you» the believers «nor from them» the Jews, rather they waver «and they swear to a lie» that is, their saying that they are believers «while they know» that they are lying about it «Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. Indeed, evil is that which they used to do» of sins «they took their faith as a shield» a cover for themselves and their wealth «and hindered» with it the believers «from the way of Allah» that is, jihad against them by killing them and taking their wealth «so for them is a humiliating punishment» one of humiliation «neither their wealth nor their children will avail them against Allah» from His punishment «at all» of enrichment «those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally»

Those are the party of Satan” his followers “Unquestionably, the party of Satan - they are the losers.” “Indeed, those who oppose” oppose “Allah and His Messenger - those are among the humiliated” the defeated
“Allah has decreed” in the Preserved Tablet or has decreed “I will surely prevail, I and My messengers” by argument or the sword “Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.”"
j-1081	“You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection” befriending “those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were” that is, the opponents “their fathers” that is, the believers “or their sons or their brothers or their kindred” rather they intend evil for them and fight them over the faith, as happened to a group of the Companions, may Allah be pleased with them. “Those” those whom they have affection for “He has decreed” established “in their hearts faith and supported them with a spirit” with light “from Him” the Most High “and He will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein. Allah is pleased with them” through His obedience “and they are pleased with Him” through His reward. “Those are the party of Allah” they follow His command and avoid His prohibition. “Unquestionably, the party of Allah - they are the successful ones” the victorious ones.
j-1082	"“Glorify God, whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth,” meaning, we glorify Him, so the lam is an addition, and in bringing what is more, “And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise,” in His kingdom and creation. “It is He who expelled those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture,” they are the Banu Nadir from the Jews, “from their homes,” their dwellings in Medina, “for the first gathering,” which is their gathering to Ash-Sham, and the last of which is that Umar expelled them during his caliphate to Khaybar. “You did not think,” O believers, “that they would go out, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them,” the predicate that “their fortresses” is its subject, the predicate is completed by it, “from God,” from His punishment. “So God came upon them,” His command and punishment, “from where they did not expect,” it did not occur to them from the side of the believers, “and cast,” He cast, “terror into their hearts,” with the sukoon of the ‘ayn and the damma of it, fear of killing their master Ka’b ibn al-Ashraf, “destroying,” with the shaddah and the khafd from akrab, “their houses,” to move what they liked from them of wood and other things, “with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed, O you who have insight.” “And had it not been that God had decreed” decreed “for them exile” leaving the homeland “He would have punished them in this world” by killing and captivity as He did with the Qurayza of the Jews “and for them in the Hereafter is the punishment of the Fire”

“That is because they opposed” disobeyed “God and His Messenger. And whoever opposes God - then indeed, God is severe in penalty” for him

“Whatever you cut down” O Muslims “of a date palm” palm tree “or left standing on its roots, it was by permission of God” that is, the best of you in that “and to disgrace” by permission to cut “the wicked” the Jews in their objection that cutting down fruit-bearing trees is corruption"
j-1083	“And what Allah has bestowed upon His Messenger from the people of the towns,” such as As-Safra’, Wadi Al-Qura and Yanbu’, “is for Allah,” He commands what He wills, “and for the Messenger and for those,” the Prophet’s relatives from Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttalib, “and for the orphans,” the children of the Muslims whose fathers died while they were poor, “and the needy,” the needy among the Muslims, “and the wayfarer,” the one stranded on his journey among the Muslims, meaning the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is entitled to it, and the four categories are entitled to it, as he used to divide it, that each of them gets a fifth of the fifth and the remainder is for him, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, and he does with it as he wishes. So he gave from it to the Muhajireen and three of the Ansar because of their poverty. “What Allah has bestowed upon His Messenger from the people of the towns,” such as As-Safra’, Wadi Al-Qura and Yanbu’, “is for Allah,” He commands with it what He wishes, “and for the Messenger and for those,” the owner of “kinship,” the Prophet’s relatives from Banu Hashim and Banu Al-Muttalib, “and for the orphans,” the children of the Muslims whose fathers died while they were poor, “and the needy,” the needy among the Muslims, “and the wayfarer,” the one stranded on his journey among the Muslims, meaning the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, is entitled to it, and the four categories are entitled to it, as he used to divide it, that each of the four gets a fifth of the fifth and the remainder is for him. “So that” “so that” “not” “so that” “the spoils” are a reason for its division, “a state” that is circulated “among the rich among you.

And if you are fought,” from which the lam that precedes it was deleted, “we will surely aid you. And God bears witness that they are liars.” “If they are expelled, they will not go out with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them, and if they aid them,” that is, they came to aid them, “they will surely turn their backs.” The answer to the implied oath dispensed with the answer to the condition in the five instances. “Then they will not be aided,” that is, the Jews. “You are more fearful,” fearful, “in their hearts,” that is, the hypocrites, “than God,” because of the delay of His punishment. “That is because they are a people who do not understand.” “They will not fight you,” that is, the Jews, “all together,” together, “except in fortified towns or from behind a wall,” a wall, and in the reading, “a wall.” ""Their violence"" their war ""is severe among them. You think they are all together, but their hearts are diverse, contrary to calculation. That is because they are a people who do not reason."" Their example in abandoning faith ""is like that of those who were shortly before them"" in a short time, and they are the polytheists of Badr.

Indeed, I fear Allah, Lord of the worlds.'"" He lied and showed hypocrisy.

j-1086	“O you who have believed, fear Allah and let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow” for the Day of Resurrection “and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do.” “And be not like those who forgot Allah” abandoned obeying Him “so He made them forget themselves” from offering any good to Him “those are the defiantly disobedient.” “Not equal are the companions of the Fire and the companions of Paradise. The companions of Paradise are the successful.”
j-1087	"“If We had sent down this Qur’an upon a mountain,” and made in it a distinction like a human being, “you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of Allah. And these examples,” mentioned, “We present them to the people that perhaps they will give thought,” so they will believe.

“He is Allah, other than whom there is no god, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed,” the secret and the public. “He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.”

“He is Allah, other than whom there is no god, the Sovereign, the Holy,” the Pure from what is not befitting of Him. “Peace,” the One free from defects. “The Believer,” the One who believes in His messengers by creating miracles for them. “The Guardian,” from hayman, yahaymin, if He is a watcher over something, that is, the witness over His servants by their deeds. “The Mighty,” the Strong, the Compeller. He compelled His creation to do what He willed. “The Proud,” from what is not befitting of Him. “Glory be to Allah,” He has purified Himself “from what they associate” with Him.

“He is Allah, the Creator, the Maker,” the Originator from nothing. “The Fashioner,” to Him belong the best names, the ninety-nine mentioned in the hadith. And “the best” is the feminine of “the best.” “Whatever is in the heavens glorifies Him.” And the earth, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. The beginning of it was presented."
j-1088	"“O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies” meaning the infidels of Mecca “as allies, meeting” communicating “to them” the intention of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, to invade them which they confided to you and concealed in Hunayn “with affection” between you and them. Hatib bin Abi Balta’ah wrote a letter to them regarding this because he had children and polytheist relatives with them, so the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, took him back from those who had sent him with him by informing him of this and accepting Hatib’s excuse for it “while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth” meaning the religion of Islam and the Qur’an “and they expel the Messenger and you” from Mecca by making things difficult for you “believe” meaning because you believed “in God, your Lord, if you have come out for jihad” for jihad “in My cause and seeking My pleasure” and the answer to the condition is indicated by what preceded it, meaning do not take them as allies “confidentially meeting them with affection, while I know what you conceal and what you declare. And whoever among you does it” meaning secretly tells them the news of the Prophet “has certainly strayed from the right path” has strayed from the path of guidance, and the right path is originally the middle way
“if they find you” They will overcome you. “They will be your enemies and will stretch out their hands against you” with killing and beating “and their tongues with evil” with cursing and insulting “and they would love” they wish “that you would disbelieve.” “Your wombs” your relatives “will not benefit you nor your children” the polytheists for whose sake you kept the news of the punishment in the Hereafter secret. “On the Day of Resurrection He will judge” in the passive voice “between you” and them, so you will be in Paradise and they will all be in Hell. “And God is Seeing of what you do.”"
j-1089	There has already been for you an example, with the breaking of the hamza and its damma in both places, a good model in Abraham, meaning in him in word and deed, and those with him of the believers, when they said to their people, “Indeed, we are disassociated” - a group of disassociated like Zarif - from you and from what you worship besides God. We have disbelieved in you, we have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you enmity and hatred forever, with the realization of the two hamzas and the replacement of the second with a waw until you believe in God alone, except for the saying of Abraham to his father, “I will surely ask forgiveness for you,” is an exception from the example, so you do not have to follow his example in that by asking forgiveness for the disbelievers. And his saying, “And I have no power over you from God,” meaning from His punishment and reward of anything, is a metaphor for the fact that he does not have power over him except asking forgiveness, so it is based on it, an exception from its apparent meaning from what is taken as an example in it, say, “So who has power over you from God at all?” And his asking forgiveness for him before it becomes clear to him that he is an enemy of God, as he mentioned in the innocence of our Lord, upon You we rely, and to You we turn, and to You is the final destination, from the saying of Al-Khalil and those with him, meaning they said, “Our Lord, do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve,” meaning do not show them On us, so they think that they are on the right path, so they are tempted, that is, their minds are lost with us. “And forgive us, our Lord. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise” in Your kingdom and creation. “There has certainly been for you” O nation of Muhammad, the answer to an implied oath. “In them is an excellent pattern for him who” a substitute for inclusion from “how much” by repeating the preposition “hopes for Allah and the Last Day” that is, fears them or thinks of reward and punishment. “And whoever turns away” by befriending the disbelievers “then indeed, Allah is the Free of need” of His creation “Praiseworthy” for those who obey Him. “Perhaps Allah will establish between you and those of them with whom you have been enemies” of the disbelievers of Mecca, in obedience to Allah the Most High, “affection” by guiding them to faith so that they become your allies. “And Allah is Able” to do that, and He did so after the conquest of Mecca. “And Allah is Forgiving” of them for what came before, “Merciful” to them.
j-1090	“Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them” a substitute for inclusion from those “and acting justly toward them” with justice, that is, with fairness, and this was before the command to fight them “for Allah loves those who act justly” with the just. “Allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid” aid “in your expulsion - from making friends with them” a substitute for inclusion from those “for you take them as friends” “and whoever takes them as friends - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.”
j-1091	“O you who have believed, when believing women come to you as emigrants” from the infidels after the peace treaty with them at Hudaybiyyah on the condition that whoever of them came to the believers would be returned, “test them” by swearing that they did not leave except out of a desire for Islam, not out of hatred for their infidel husbands or love for Muslim men. This is how the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, used to make them swear. “God knows best as to their faith. But if you ascertain that they are believers, then do not return them” return them “to the disbelievers. They are not lawful for them, nor are they lawful for them. And give them” that is, give the infidels their husbands “what they have spent” on them of dowries. “And there is no blame upon you if you marry them” on the condition “when you have given them their dowries” their dowries. “And do not hold” with emphasis and with emphasis “the marriage bonds of disbelieving women” your wives, in order to sever your Islam with the condition, or those who join the polytheists as apostates, in order to sever your marriage with the condition, “and ask” seek “what you have spent.” “And let them ask what they spent” on the emigrants, as was mentioned earlier, that they were given it. “That is the judgment of God, with which He judges between you” by it. “And God is Wise over you.” “And if you miss any of your wives” meaning one or more of them or any of the dowries by going “to the disbelievers” apostates “and you punish” by raiding and taking booty. “Then give those whose wives have gone” from the booty “the like of what they spent” because it was lost to them on the part of the disbelievers. “And fear God, in whom you are believers.” The believers did what they were commanded to do in giving to the disbelievers and the believers, then this judgment was lifted.
j-1092	“O Prophet, when believing women come to you pledging allegiance to you that they will not associate anything with Allah, nor steal, nor commit adultery, nor kill their children,” as was done in the days of ignorance by burying girls alive, for fear of shame and poverty, “nor bring forth a slander they have invented between their hands and feet,” that is, an abandoned child whom they attribute to the husband and describe as a real child, for when the mother gives birth to him, he falls between her hands and feet, “nor disobey you in” doing “what is right,” which is what is in accordance with obedience to Allah, such as refraining from wailing, tearing clothes, cutting hair, tearing garments, and scratching the face, “then take their pledge,” the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, did that verbally, and did not shake hands with any of them, “and ask forgiveness for them from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” “O you who believe, do not take as allies a people with whom Allah has become angry,” that is, the Jews. “They have despaired of the Hereafter,” of its reward, despite their belief in it, due to their stubbornness towards the Prophet, despite their knowledge of his truthfulness, “just as the disbelievers have despaired,” those who are, “of the companions of Allah.” The graves” meaning the buried ones will have the best of the Hereafter, as their seats in Paradise will be shown to them if they had believed, and what they will end up in of the Fire.
j-1093	“Glorify God, whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth,” meaning glorify Him, so the lam is an addition and what is less than “from” is brought to make the majority more prevalent. “And He is the Exalted in Might,” in His kingdom, “the Wise,” in His creation. “O you who have believed, why do you say,” in seeking jihad, “that which you do not do,” when you were defeated by Uhud? “It is most hateful,” a specification, “in the sight of God,” that you should say, the subject of “most hateful,” “that which you do not do.” “Indeed, God loves,” He gives victory and honors, “those who fight in His cause in ranks,” a state, meaning in rows, “as if they were a solid structure,” one part glued to the other, fixed.
j-1094	“And” remember “when Moses said to his people, ‘O my people, why do you harm me?’” They said that he was a swollen testicle, which was not the case, and they denied him. “And you know” to be certain “that I am the Messenger of God to you.” The sentence is a state, and the Messenger is respected. “But when they deviated” they turned away from the truth by harming him, “God made their hearts deviate” He inclined them away from guidance according to what He had decreed in eternity. “And God does not guide the wicked people” the disbelievers in His knowledge.
j-1095	“And” remember “when Jesus, son of Mary, said, “O Children of Israel,” he did not say “O people,” because he was not related to them, “I am the Messenger of God to you, confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name is Ahmad.” God Almighty said, “But when he came to them,” Ahmad came to the disbelievers, “with clear proofs,” the signs and verses, “they said, ‘This is magic,’” in another reading, “magician,” meaning the one who brought it, “clear,” “and who is more unjust,” more unjust, “than he who invents a lie against God,” by attributing a partner and a son to Him and describing His signs as magic, “while he is invited to Islam? And God does not guide the wrongdoing people,” the disbelievers. “They want to extinguish,” in the accusative case, with an implied “an,” and the lam is an addition, “the light of God,” His law and proofs, “with their mouths,” with their words that it is magic, poetry, and divination, “but God will perfect,” reveal, “His light,” in another reading, “even though the disbelievers dislike it.” “It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth.” To make it prevail over all religions, even though the polytheists hate it.
j-1096	"""O you who have believed, shall I guide you to a trade that will save you from a painful punishment?"" with emphasis and emphasis, ""from a painful punishment."" It is as if they said yes, so he said. ""You believe"" with persistence in belief ""in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is better for you, if you only knew."" that it is better for you, so do it. ""He will forgive"" is the answer to an implied condition, meaning if you do it, He will forgive ""your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual bliss."" ""That is the great attainment."" ""And He will give you another that you love, victory from Allah and an imminent conquest. And give good tidings to the believers"" of victory and conquest. ""O you who have believed, be supporters of Allah"" for His religion. In another reading with addition, ""as he said"" etc. The meaning is as the disciples were, so is the one indicating it. He said, ""Jesus, son of Mary, to the disciples, 'Who are my supporters for Allah?'"" meaning who are with me, heading toward the support of Allah. ""The disciples said, 'We are the supporters of Allah.'"" The disciples are the chosen ones of Jesus and they were the first to believe in him, and they were twelve men. From the word “hawr” which means pure whiteness. It was said that they were short-skinned people who bleached their clothes, that is, they whitened them. “A party of the Children of Israel believed” in Jesus and said that he was the servant of God who was raised to heaven. “And a party disbelieved” because they said that he was the son of God who was raised to Him. So the two parties fought. “So We supported” strengthened “those who believed” from the two parties “over their enemy” the disbelieving party. “And they became dominant” victorious."
j-1097	"""Whatever is in the heavens and the earth glorifies God"" glorifies Him, for the lam is redundant ""the King, the Holy"" is mentioned, the Exalted in Might, the Wise in His kingdom and creation.

He gives it to whom He wills.” The Prophet and those mentioned with him. “And God is the possessor of great bounty.”"
j-1098	"“The parable of those who were entrusted with the Torah” who were charged with working by it “and then did not uphold it” they did not work according to what was in it of his description, may God bless him and grant him peace, so they did not believe in him “is like that of a donkey who carries volumes” that is, books in not benefiting from them “Evil is the parable of the people who deny the signs of God” that confirm the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and the one specifically blamed is omitted, its meaning is this parable “and God does not guide the wrongdoing people” the disbelievers
“Say, ‘O you who are Jews, if you claim that you are allies of God rather than the people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful’” The two conditions are attached to wishing for death, because the first is a restriction on the second, that is, if you are truthful in your claim that you are allies of God, and the guardian prefers the Hereafter and its beginning is death, then wish for it
“and they will never wish for it because of what their hands have put forth” of their disbelief in the Prophet, which necessitates their lying “and God is Knowing of the wrongdoers” the disbelievers
“Say, ‘Indeed, the death from which you flee - it will meet you, then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed’” the secret And the public “He will inform you of what you used to do” and He will reward you for it."
j-1099	"“O you who have believed, when the call is made for the prayer on” meaning on “the day of Jumu’ah, then proceed” so proceed “to the remembrance of Allah” for the prayer “and leave off business” leave its contract “that is better for you if you only knew” that it is better so do it

“So when the prayer is concluded, disperse within the land” an order of permission “and seek” seek provision “from the bounty of Allah and remember Allah” much “that you may succeed” you may succeed. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was delivering a sermon on Friday when a caravan arrived and a drum was beaten as usual for its arrival, so the people came out of the mosque except for twelve men, so this verse was revealed

“And when they see a trade or amusement, they disperse to it” meaning the trade because it is what they seek, not amusement “and leave you” in the sermon “standing. Say, ‘What is with Allah’” of reward “is better” for those who believe “than amusement and business. And Allah is the best of providers” it is said that every person provides for his family, meaning from the provision of Allah the Most High."

""They have taken their oaths as a shield,"" a cover for their wealth and blood, ""and have turned away,"" with it, ""from the way of Allah,"" that is, from jihad in their cause. ""Indeed, evil is that which they have been doing."" ""That,"" that is, the evil of their actions, ""is because they believed,"" with their tongues, ""then disbelieved,"" in their hearts, that is, they persisted in their disbelief in Him. ""So a seal was placed,"" with disbelief, ""on their hearts, so they do not understand,"" faith. ""And when you see them, their bodies impress you,"" because of their beauty. ""And if they speak, you listen to their speech,"" because of its eloquence, ""as if,"" because of the size of their bodies in their failure to understand, ""wood,"" with a silent shin and a damma, ""propping up,"" leaning against the wall. ""They think every shout,"" that is, a call to arms and a call to action, ""is against them."" Because of the fear in their hearts that something will befall them that would make their blood permissible. “They are the enemy, so beware of them,” for they will divulge your secret to the infidels. “May God destroy them,” may He destroy them. “How are they turned away from faith?” How can they be turned away from faith after the proof has been established?"
j-1101	"""And when it is said to them, 'Come, that the Messenger of Allah may ask forgiveness for you,' they turn their heads away, and you see them turning away, turning away from that, while they are arrogant."" ""It is all the same to them whether you ask forgiveness for them,"" the interrogative hamza is dispensed with instead of the hamzat al-wasl, ""or whether you ask forgiveness for them - Allah will never forgive them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people."" ""They are the ones who say,"" to their companions from the Ansar, ""Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah,"" from the emigrants, ""until they disperse,"" they disperse from him.

Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with him, said: “No one neglects zakat and Hajj except that he asks to be returned at death.” “And Allah will not delay a soul when its term has come. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.” With the ta’ and the ya’
j-1103	"“Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth glorifies God” He glorifies Him, so the lam is redundant, and He brought what is less than “to Him belongs dominion and to Him is praise, and He is over all things competent”

“It is He who created you, and among you are disbelievers and among you are believers” in the original creation, then He will cause you to die and return you to that state “and God is Seeing of what you do”

j-1104	“Has there not come to you,” O disbelievers of Mecca, “the news,” news, “of those who disbelieved before? So they tasted the consequences of their deed,” the punishment for disbelief in this world. “And for them,” in the Hereafter, “is a painful punishment,” painful. “That,” that is, the punishment of this world, “is because,” the pronoun of the subject, “their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs,” the apparent arguments for faith. “And they said, ‘Give us good news,’” meaning the genus, “that they will guide us. But they disbelieved and turned away,” from faith. “And God is independent,” from their faith. “And God is independent,” from His creation, “Praiseworthy,” praised in His actions.
j-1105	"""Those who disbelieve claim that"" is a lightened word and its subject is omitted, meaning that they ""will not be resurrected.

But if you turn away, then upon Our Messenger is only the clear notification.” “Allah - there is no god except Him. And upon Allah let the believers rely.”
j-1107	“O you who have believed, indeed, among your wives and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them.” Do not obey them in refraining from doing good, such as jihad and migration, for the reason for the revelation of the verse was obedience in that. “But if you pardon” them in discouraging you from doing that good, citing the difficulty of your separation from them, “and overlook and forgive, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.” “Your wealth and your children are but a trial” to distract you from the affairs of the Hereafter, “and Allah has with Him a great reward” so do not miss it by being occupied with wealth and children. “So fear Allah as much as you are able” abrogates His statement, “Fear Allah as He should be feared” “and listen” to what you have been commanded to do with acceptance, “and obey and spend” in obedience, “that is better for yourselves” the news of “Yakun” which is understood as the answer to the command. “And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful” the winners. “If you loan Allah a goodly loan” by giving charity out of a good heart, “He will multiply it for you” and in another reading, He will multiply it by emphasizing the one by ten to seven hundred and more. “And He forgives you” whatever He wills. “And God is Most Appreciative” rewarding obedience. “Forbearing” in punishing disobedience. “Knower of the unseen” the secret “and the witnessed” the public. “The Almighty” in His kingdom. “The Wise” in His creation.
j-1108	“O Prophet,” meaning his nation, with its context that follows it, or say to them, “when you divorce women,” meaning if you intend divorce, “divorce them during their waiting period,” the first of which is that the divorce should be during a period of purity in which she has not been touched, according to his interpretation, may God bless him and grant him peace, as narrated by the two sheikhs. “And count the waiting period,” memorize it so that you may return before it ends. “And fear God, your Lord,” obey Him in His commands and prohibitions. “Do not turn them out of their houses, nor should they leave them,” until their waiting period expires, “unless they commit a clear indecency,” adultery, with the opening of the ya’ or its breaking, clear or clear, then they are expelled to have the prescribed punishment carried out on them. “And those,” the things mentioned, “are the limits of God, and whoever transgresses the limits of God has wronged himself. You do not know, perhaps God will bring about after that,” the divorce, “another matter,” a review, whether it is one or two. “But when they have reached their term,” their waiting period is about to expire, “then keep them,” by returning to them, “according to kindness,” without causing harm, “or part with them according to kindness,” leave them until Their waiting period ends and you do not harm them by returning to them. “And bring to witness two just men among you” to the return or separation. “And establish the testimony for God” not for the witness or for him. “This is admonished for whoever believes in God and the Last Day. And whoever fears God - He will make for him a way out” from the distress of this world and the Hereafter. “And He will provide for him from where he does not expect” that occurs to him. “And whoever relies upon God” in his affairs, “Then He is sufficient for him” sufficient. “Indeed, God will accomplish His purpose” what He intended. And in a reading with the addition, “God has already set for everything” such as ease and hardship “a measure” a time.
j-1109	And those with a hamza and a ya’ and without a ya’ in both places who have despaired of menstruation, meaning menstruation, from your women, if you are in doubt, you can doubt their waiting period, then their waiting period is three months. And those who have not menstruated because of their young age, then their waiting period is three months. The two questions are about those whose husbands have not died. As for them, their waiting period is what is in the verse: They shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days. And for those who are pregnant, their term is the expiration of their waiting period. Whether they are divorced or their husbands have died, they shall give birth. And whoever fears Allah, He will make for him of his affair ease in this world and the Hereafter. “That” mentioned in the waiting period “is the command of Allah” His ruling “He has sent it down to you. And whoever fears Allah, He will remove from him his misdeeds and magnify for him a reward.” “Lodge them” meaning the divorced women “where you dwell” meaning some of your dwellings “according to your means” meaning your means, an explanatory apposition or a substitute for what came before it by repeating the preposition and estimating the complement meaning the places of your means, not what is less than that “and do not harm them in order to make things difficult for them” the dwellings so that they will need to go out or provide for them. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them until they give birth. Then if they breastfeed for you, your children from them, then give them their compensation, for breastfeeding, and consult among yourselves, between you, in a fair manner, in a good manner with regard to the children by agreeing on a known wage for breastfeeding. And if you are in difficulty, if you are in difficulty in breastfeeding, so the father refuses to pay and the mother refuses to do so, then another woman shall breastfeed for him, for the father, and the mother shall not be forced to breastfeed him. Let him spend, on the divorced and breastfeeding women, one who has plenty of wealth, according to his plenty. And he who is constrained, his provision should spend from what God has given him, according to his capacity. God does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. God will bring about, after hardship, ease. And He made it in Al-Futuh.

""So it tasted the consequences of its deed"" its punishment ""and the outcome of its deed was loss"" loss and destruction. ""Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment"" the repetition of the threat is an emphasis. ""So fear Allah, O you of understanding"" those who have intellects ""who have believed"" an adjective for the one being addressed or an explanation of it. ""Allah has sent down to you a message"" that is, the Qur'an. ""A Messenger"" that is, Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, is in the accusative case with an implied verb, meaning, and He sent ""reciting to you the clear verses of Allah"" with the fatha or kasra of the ya' as mentioned previously ""that He may bring forth those who believe and do righteous deeds"" after the coming of the message and the Messenger ""from darkness"" the disbelief that they were upon ""into the light"" the faith that they established after “And whoever believes in God and does righteousness, He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. God has certainly made him a good provision.” It is the provision of Paradise, the bliss of which never ceases. “God is He who created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof.” That is, seven earths. “The command descends between them.” That is, between the heavens and the earth, Gabriel descends with it from the seventh heaven to the seventh earth. “That you may know.” It is related to something omitted, that is, He informed you of that creation and revelation. “That God is over all things competent and that God encompasses all things in knowledge.”"
j-1111	"""O Prophet, why do you forbid what Allah has made lawful for you?"" of your slave girl, Mariyah al-Qibtiyyah, when he had intercourse with her in Hafsah's house, and she was absent, then she came and it was difficult for her that it was in her house and on her bed, as you said, ""It is forbidden to me, seeking"" by forbidding her ""the pleasure of your wives,"" meaning their satisfaction. ""And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" He forgave you this forbidding. Allah has imposed a law for you to expiate your oaths, to expiate them with the expiation mentioned in Surat al-Ma'idah. And from faith is the forbidding of a slave girl. Did the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, disbelieve? Muqatil said, ""He freed a slave for forbidding Mariyah."" Al-Hasan said, ""He did not disbelieve because the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, was forgiven, and Allah is your Master and Helper, and He is the Knowing, the Wise."" ""And"" remember, ""when the Prophet confided to one of his wives,"" that is, Hafsah, ""a statement,"" that is, the forbidding of Mariyah, and he told her not to divulge it. ""So when she informed it,"" that is, Aishah, thinking that there was no harm in that, ""and Allah revealed it,"" informed him, ""he knew some of it,"" to Hafsah. ""And turn away from some"" out of his generosity ""and when he informed her of it, she said, 'Who informed you of this?' He said, 'The Knowing, the Aware informed me'"" meaning God. ""If you both repent"" meaning Hafsah and Aishah ""to God, your hearts have already inclined"" inclined to forbid Maria, meaning that you were pleased with that despite the Prophet's dislike of it, and that is a sin. The answer to the condition is omitted, meaning you accept. He used the word ""hearts"" to mean two hearts and did not express it because it is difficult to combine two duals in what is like a single word. ""And if you both support each other"" by assimilating the second ta' in the original into the dhad, and in a reading without it they cooperate ""against him"" meaning the Prophet in what he dislikes ""then indeed God is"" separate ""his Protector"" his supporter ""and Gabriel and the righteous believers"" Abu Bakr and Umar, may God be pleased with them, are conjoined to the place of the name of if, so they will be his supporters ""and the angels after that"" after God's support and the two mentioned ""backers"" backers, helpers for him in his support against you. ""Perhaps his Lord, if he divorces you"" meaning the Prophet divorces his wives ""will replace him"" with the emphasis and the lightening “Wives better than you” is the predicate of “may” and the sentence is the answer to the condition and the change did not occur because the condition did not occur “Muslims” who acknowledge Islam “Believers” who are sincere “obedient” who are obedient “Repentant, worshipping, traveling” who fast or emigrate “Wives who are married or virgins”"
j-1112	“O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones,” such as their idols, meaning that it is extremely hot and burns with what was mentioned, not like the fire of this world which burns with wood and the like. “Over it are [appointed] angels,” its guardians, their number being nineteen, as will come in Al-Muddaththir. “Harsh” from the hardness of the heart, “severe” in striking. “They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them,” instead of majesty, meaning that they do not disobey Allah’s command. “And they do what they are commanded.” This is an emphasis, and the verse is a warning to the believers against apostasy and to the hypocrites who believe with their tongues but not with their hearts. “O you who have disbelieved, make no excuses this Day,” this will be said to them when they enter the Fire, meaning that it will not benefit you. “You will only be recompensed for what you used to do,” meaning its recompense.
j-1113	“O you who have believed, repent to Allah with sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow on the Day when Allah will not recompense the Prophet and those who have believed with him.

j-1114	“O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. Their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.”
j-1115	“Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them.” In religion, since they disbelieved. Noah’s wife, whose name was Wahlah, used to tell his people that he was crazy, and Lot’s wife, whose name was Wahlah, used to guide his people to his guests when they came to him by night by lighting a fire and by day by smoking. “But they did not avail them at all against Allah.” And it was said to them, “Enter the Fire with those who enter.” Of the disbelievers of Noah’s people and Lot’s people. “And Allah sets forth an example for those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh.” She believed in Moses, and her name was Asiya, so Pharaoh tortured her by attaching her hands and feet to her, and he placed a great millstone on her chest and made her face the sun. When those who were assigned to her dispersed from her, the angels shaded her. “When she said,” in the state of torture, “My Lord, build for me near You a house in Paradise.” So He revealed it to her and she saw it, making the torture easy for her. “And save me from Pharaoh and his deeds.” And his torture, “and save me from the wrongdoing people,” the people of his religion. So God took her soul. Ibn Kaysan said, “She was raised to Paradise alive, so she eats and drinks.” “And Mary,” referring to Pharaoh’s wife, “the daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity,” guarded it. “So We breathed into her of Our spirit,” meaning Gabriel, when he breathed into the pocket of her armor with the creation of God Almighty, his action, reaching her chastity, so she became pregnant with Jesus. “And she believed in the words of her Lord,” His laws, “and His books,” the revealed ones, “and she was of the obedient,” of the obedient people.

""And they will say, 'If only we had listened' meaning, hearing to understand, ""or reasoned"" meaning, reasoning to think, ""we would not have been among the companions of the Blaze""

j-1118	“Indeed, those who fear their Lord” fear Him “in secret” when they are absent from the eyes of people, so they obey Him secretly, which is better in public. “For them is forgiveness and a great reward” meaning Paradise.
j-1119	"""And conceal"" O people, ""your speech or declare it aloud. Indeed, He is All-Knowing of that within the breasts"" what is in them, so how about what you utter?

""Does He not know who created"" what you conceal, that is, does He not know that? ""And He is the Subtle"" in His knowledge, ""the Acquainted"" with it.

The damma on the ya was too heavy, so it was transferred to a ha and the waw was deleted. The second of the two quiescent letters is to increase it, and the damma was changed to a kasra to match the yaa."
j-1153	“Indeed, We have sent to you,” O people of Mecca, “a Messenger,” who is Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace, “as a witness against you,” on the Day of Resurrection, regarding your disobedience, “just as We sent to Pharaoh a Messenger,” who is Moses, may God bless him and grant him peace. “But Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger, so We seized him with a terrible punishment,” a severe one. “Then how can you guard yourself, if you disbelieve,” in this world, “a Day,” the object of tataqawan, meaning its punishment? With what fortress can you guard yourself against the punishment of a Day “that will make the children grey-haired,” the plural of ashib, due to the severity of its terror, which is the Day of Resurrection. The root of shīn in shaybā is ḍammah, but it was broken to match the ya’. It is said of the severe day, a day that will make the forelocks of children grey, and this is a metaphor. It is also possible that what is meant in the verse is the truth. “The sky will be split,” meaning split, “with it,” on that Day due to its severity. “His promise,” the Most High, of its coming, “will be fulfilled,” meaning it will inevitably happen. “Indeed, these,” the frightening verses, “are a reminder,” an admonition to creation, “so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way,” a way through faith.

And the standing of a group of his companions is like that to follow his example. Among them were those who did not know how much of the night they had prayed and how much of it remained, so they stood up all night as a precaution. They stood until their feet swelled for a year or more, so He made things easier for them. God Almighty said, “And God is able,” He counts, “the night and the day. He knows that” in the genitive case, the heavy one, and its subject is omitted, meaning that “you will not count it,” meaning the night, in order to stand up for what is required to be done, except by standing all of it, and that is difficult for you. “So He has turned to you,” He returned you to making things easier. “So recite what is easy for you of the Qur’an,” in prayer, by praying what is easy. “He knows that” in the genitive case, the heavy one, meaning that “there will be among you sick and others traveling throughout the land,” traveling, “seeking of the bounty of God,” seeking His provision through trade and other things. “And others fight in the cause of Allah.” Each of the three groups finds it difficult to do what was mentioned in the night prayer, so it was made easier for them by performing what they could of it. Then that was abrogated by the five daily prayers. “So recite what is easy of it,” as mentioned above, “and establish prayer,” the obligatory ones, “and give zakah and lend Allah,” by spending what is not obligatory of money in the way of good, “a good loan,” with a good heart. “And whatever good you send forth for yourselves, you will find it with Allah. It is better,” than what you left behind, and it is a chapter and what follows, even if it is not a definite noun that resembles it because it is prevented from being defined, “and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful,” to the believers.

""And let not those who were given the Scripture and the believers doubt,"" from others, about the number of angels. ""And let those in whose hearts is disease"" doubt in Medina ""and the disbelievers"" in Mecca say. “What did God mean by this” the number “for example” they called it that because of its strangeness and expressed it as a state “like that” that is, like misleading the one who denies this number and guiding the one who believes it “God misguides whom He wills and guides whom He wills, and none knows the soldiers of your Lord” that is, the angels in their strength and their helpers “except Him, and it” that is, Hell “is only a reminder to mankind”"

""And what is the matter with them ""when the Qur'an is recited to them, they do not prostrate"" they submit by believing in it due to its miraculousness

""Rather, those who disbelieve deny"" the resurrection and other things

""And Allah knows best what they conceal"" they collect in their books of disbelief, denial and evil deeds

""So give them tidings"" inform them ""of a painful punishment"" painful

""Except"" but ""those who believe and do righteous deeds - for them is a reward Unthankful, not cut off, not diminished, and not bestowed upon him"
j-1209	"""And the heaven with its constellations"" the twelve constellations mentioned in Al-Furqan

""And the promised day"" the Day of Resurrection

""And a witness"" Friday ""And witnessed"" the Day of Arafah. This is how the three were explained in the hadith. The first is promised, the second is a witness to the work in it, and the third is witnessed by the people and the angels. The answer to the oath is omitted, its beginning is understood to mean that

""He killed"" cursed ""the companions of the trench"" the crack in the ground

""The fire"" is a substitute for inclusion from it ""with fuel"" what is kindled with

""When they were over it"" around it on the side of the trench on chairs ""sitting""

""And they were witnesses to what they were doing to the believers"" in God of torturing them by throwing them into the fire if they did not return from their faith. ""Witnesses"" are present. It was narrated that God saved the believers who were thrown into the fire by taking their souls before they fell into it, and the fire came out to them from there and burned them

""And they did not find fault with them except that they believed in God, the Exalted in Might"" in His kingdom, ""The Praiseworthy"" the Praised
""To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and God is Witness over all things"" meaning that the disbelievers did not denounce the believers except Their faith"
j-1210	“Indeed, those who have put believing men and believing women to trial” by burning “and then have not repented - for them is the punishment of Hell” for their disbelief “and for them is the punishment of the Burning Fire” meaning the punishment of their burning the believers in the Hereafter. It was also said that it was in this world, when the fire was brought out and burned them, as mentioned above. “Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the great attainment.”
j-1211	"""Indeed, the punishment of your Lord"" against the disbelievers ""is severe"" according to His will. ""It is He who begins"" creation ""and repeats"", so nothing is beyond His power. ""And He is the Forgiving"" of the sinners and believers, ""the Loving"", the One who is kind to His friends with honor. ""The Lord of the Throne"", its Creator and Owner, ""the Glorious"" with the elevation deserved for the perfection of the attributes of loftiness. ""The Doer of whatever He wills"", nothing is beyond His power."
j-1212	"""Has there come to you"" O Muhammad ""the story of the soldiers""?

""Pharaoh and Thamud"" instead of the soldiers, and the mention of Pharaoh is sufficient instead of his followers and their story that they were destroyed because of their disbelief. This is a warning to those who disbelieve in the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and the Qur'an, so that they may learn a lesson.

""Rather, those who disbelieve are in denial"" of what was mentioned.

""And God is behind them encompassing"" they have no protection from it.

""Rather, it is a glorious Qur'an"" great.

""On a tablet"" it is in the air above the seventh heaven. ""Preserved"" by the accusative from the devils and from changing anything in it. Its length is between the heaven and the earth and its width is between the east and the west. It is made of white pearl. This was said by Ibn Abbas, may God be pleased with them both."
j-1213	"""By the sky and the nightcomer"" its origin is everything that comes at night and from it the stars because they rise at night. ""And what will make you know"" I will inform you. ""What is the nightcomer"" is a subject and predicate in the place of the second object of ""I know"" and what comes after the first is its predicate and in it is the magnification of the nightcomer explained by what comes after it is. ""The star"" meaning the Pleiades or every star ""The piercing"" shining because it pierces the darkness with its light and the answer to the oath. ""Indeed, every soul has a guardian over it"" with a lightened ""ma"" so it is an addition and ""in"" is lightened from the heavy and its name is deleted meaning that it is and the lam is a separator and with its emphasis ""in"" is a negative and ""lama"" means except and the guardian from the angels preserves its work from good and evil"
j-1214	"“So let man consider” with consideration “from what he was created” from what

The answer is “He was created from a gushing fluid” that gushes from the man and the woman in her womb

“It emerges from between the backbone” of the man “and the ribs” of the woman, which are the bones of the chest

“He” the Most High “is able to bring him back” resurrecting the man after his death “so if he considers his origin he will know that the one who is able to do that is able to resurrect him

“On the Day when the secrets” the hearts’ secrets in beliefs and intentions will be tested and revealed

“Then he” the denier of the resurrection “will have no power” to protect himself from the punishment “nor any helper” to repel it"
j-1215	"""And the sky with its recurring paths"" rain for its return every now and then

""And the earth with its rifts"" the cracks that reveal plants

""It"" i.e. the Qur'an ""is a decisive statement"" distinguishing between truth and falsehood

""And it is not a joke"" play and falsehood

""They"" i.e. the disbelievers ""are plotting a plot"" they are plotting against the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace

""And I am surely plotting a plot"" I lure them in from where they do not know

""So grant respite"" O Muhammad, ""the disbelievers, grant them respite"" emphasizing its goodness by contradicting the wording, i.e. give them respite ""slowly"" a little while, and it is a source emphasizing the meaning of the agent, diminutive of rod or arowad on the basis of elision, and God Almighty seized them at Badr and abrogated the respite with the verse of the sword, i.e. the command to fight and strive"
j-1216	“Glorify the name of your Lord” meaning, glorify your Lord from what is not befitting of Him. The additional name “the Most High” is an attribute of your Lord. “Who created and proportioned” His creation, making it proportionate and not unequal. “And who determined” what He willed “and guided” to what He determined of good and evil. “And who brought forth the pasture” caused the grass to grow “and made it” after the green “stubble” dry and brittle “black” dry and black.
j-1217	"""We will make you recite"" the Qur'an ""and you will not forget"" what you recite
""except what Allah wills"" that you forget by abrogating its recitation and its ruling. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, would recite aloud with Gabriel's recitation for fear of forgetting, so it was as if he was told, ""Do not rush it, you will not forget, so do not tire yourself by reciting it aloud. ""Indeed, He knows what is said aloud"" of speech and action ""and what is hidden"" of them. ""And We will make you easy for the easy"" of the easy Shari'ah, which is Islam. ""So remind"" admonish with the Qur'an ""if the reminder should benefit"" of the reminder mentioned in ""will remember"" meaning even if it does not benefit, and its benefit is for some and its lack of benefit is for others. ""He will remind"" with it ""who fears"" fears Allah, the Most High, like a verse, so remind with the Qur'an whoever fears His threat. ""And avoids it"" meaning the reminder, meaning he leaves it aside and does not pay attention to it. ""The wretched"" meaning the disbeliever. ""He who will enter the greater Fire"" is the fire of the Hereafter and the lesser is the fire of this world. ""Then he will neither die in it"" so he will rest ""nor live"" a life. Happy"
j-1218	"""He has certainly succeeded"" won ""whoever purifies himself"" purifies himself with faith

""And remembers the name of his Lord"" glorifying ""and prays"" the five daily prayers, and that is from the matters of the Hereafter, and the infidels of Mecca are turning away from them

""Rather, you prefer"" with the upper and lower ""the life of this world"" over the Hereafter

""And the Hereafter"" which includes Paradise ""is better and more lasting""

""This"" the success of whoever purifies himself and the Hereafter being better ""is in the former scriptures"" that is, the one revealed before the Qur'an

""The scriptures of Abraham and Moses"" which are ten scriptures for Abraham and the Torah for Moses"
j-1219	"""Has there come to you the news of the Overwhelming"" the Resurrection because it overwhelms creation with its terrors? ""On that Day some faces"" it refers to the entities in the two subjects ""will be humbled"" submissive
""Toiling and weary"" suffering from fatigue and exhaustion with chains and shackles

""And carpets"" rugs with nap ""Spread out"""
j-1221	"“Do they not look” meaning the infidels of Mecca with a look of consideration “at the camels, how they are created”
“and at the sky, how it is raised”
“and at the mountains, how it is erected”
“and at the earth, how it is spread out” meaning it is spread out, so they use it as evidence of the power and oneness of God Almighty. It was mentioned with camels because they are more closely connected to it than anything else, and his saying “spread out” is apparent in the earth, a surface, and the scholars of the Sharia have agreed on this, not a sphere, as the people of astronomy have said, even if it does not violate a pillar of the Sharia."
j-1222	"""So remind"" they are the blessings of God and the evidence of His Oneness ""You are only a reminder"" ""You are not a controller over them"" and in a reading with the letter ""seen"" instead of the letter ""sad"" meaning a controller, and this is before the command to fight
""Except"" but ""whoever turns away"" turns away from faith ""and disbelieves"" in the Qur'an
""Then God will punish him with the greater punishment"" the punishment of the Hereafter and the lesser punishment of this world by killing and captivity
""Indeed, to Us is their return"" their return after death
""Then upon Us is their reckoning"" their recompense, which we will never abandon"
j-1223	"""By the dawn"" i.e. the dawn of every day

""And ten nights"" i.e. the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah

""And the even"" i.e. the pair ""And the odd"" i.e. the opening of the waw and its breaking are two languages ​​of the individual

""And the night when it departs"" approaching and departing

""Is there in that"" the oath ""an oath for one of reason"" intellect and the answer to the oath is omitted i.e. you will surely be punished, O disbelievers of Mecca

""Have you not seen"" know, O Muhammad ""how your Lord dealt with the 'Ad""
""Iram"" is the first 'Ad, so Iram is an explanatory apposition or a substitute and prevented from being declined due to being a proper noun and feminine ""of pillars"" i.e. tall, the tallest of them was four hundred cubits

""The like of which had never been created in the land"" in their violence and strength

""And Thamud who cut"" they cut ""the rocks"" plural of rock and made them houses ""in the valley"" Wadi al-Qura

""And Pharaoh, the lord of the stakes"" he used to fasten four stakes to which he would tie the hands and feet of the one he was punishing

""Those who transgressed"" they acted tyrannically ""in the land""

""And spread corruption therein"" killing and other things
“So your Lord poured down upon them a scourge” of a type “of punishment.” “Indeed, your Lord is ever watchful” He monitors the deeds of His servants and nothing of them escapes Him in order to punish them for them."
j-1224	"""As for man,"" the disbeliever, ""when his Lord tests him and honors him,"" with wealth and other things, ""and blesses him, he says, ""My Lord has honored me."" 

""But when He tests him and restricts his provision for him, he says, ""My Lord has humiliated me."" 

""No,"" a deterrent, meaning that honor is not in wealth and humiliation is in poverty, but rather it is in obedience and disobedience, and the disbelievers of Mecca do not pay attention to that. ""Rather, they do not honor the orphan,"" they do not treat him well despite their wealth or do not give him his share of the inheritance. 

""And they do not urge,"" themselves or others, ""on the food,"" meaning the food of ""the poor."" 

""And you consume the inheritance,"" the inheritance, ""devouring all,"" meaning intensely, the share of women and children from the inheritance with their share of it or with their money. 

""And they love wealth with an overwhelming love,"" meaning a lot, so they do not spend it. And in a reading with the upper vowel in the four verbs"
j-1225	"""No"" is a deterrent to them from that. ""When the earth is pounded to powder"" shaken until every building on it collapses and is destroyed. ""And your Lord will come"" that is, His command ""and the angels"" that is, the angels ""rank upon rank"" a state, that is, arranged or in many rows. ""And Hell will be brought forth on that Day"" led by seventy thousand reins, each rein in the hands of seventy thousand angels that sigh and roar. ""On that Day"" is a substitute for if and its answer ""man will remember"" that is, the disbeliever, what he neglected ""and how will the remembrance benefit him?"" An interrogative with the meaning of negation, that is, his remembrance of that will not benefit him. ""He will say"" with his remembrance ""Oh"" to alert ""I wish I had sent forth"" goodness and faith ""for my good life"" in the Hereafter or the time of my life in this world. ""For on that Day no one will punish"" with a broken dhal ""with His punishment"" that is, God ""with"" that is, He will not leave him to anyone else. ""And"" likewise ""no one will bind"" with a broken thā' ""with His bond"" and in a reading with a fathah on the dhal and the thā', the pronoun is His punishment and His binding of the disbeliever. The meaning is that no one is punished as He is punished, nor is anyone bound as He is bound.

“O reassured soul,” the secure one, which is the believer.

“Return to your Lord,” it is said to it at death, that is, return to His command and will. “Well-pleased,” with the reward. “Pleasant” with God for your work, that is, combining the two descriptions, and they are two states. It is said to it on the Day of Resurrection.

“Then enter among,” the group, “My servants,” the righteous.

“And enter My Paradise,” with them."
j-1226	"""La"" is redundant. ""I swear by this city"" Mecca. ""And you"" O Muhammad, ""are permitted"" permissible ""in this city"" that it is permissible for you to fight in it. And God fulfilled this promise for him on the day of the conquest. So the sentence is an interjection between what is sworn by and what is conjoined to it. ""And the father"" meaning Adam. ""And what he begot"" meaning his offspring. ""What"" has the meaning of ""whom"" ""Indeed, We created man"" meaning the species ""in hardship"" in the accusative case and in difficulty, enduring the calamities of this world and the hardships of the Hereafter."
j-1227	"""Does man think"" Does man think that the strong man of Quraysh, who is Abu al-Ashd ibn Kalda, is strong? ""That"" is a lightened version of the heavy one and its subject is omitted, meaning that ""no one will be able to overpower him"" and God is able to overpower him. ""He says, 'I have spent' in enmity to Muhammad ""a great wealth"", some of it on top of some. ""Does he think that"" that is, that ""no one saw him"" in what he spent and knows its value, and God knows its value and that it is not something that is multiplied by it and He will reward him for his bad action. ""Have We not made"" is a question of confirmation, meaning We made ""for him two eyes""
""and a tongue and two lips""
""And guided him to the two paths"" We showed him the path of good and evil."
j-1228	"""No"" why didn't he ""storm the pass"" cross it? ""And what would make you know"" I will inform you ""what the pass is"" that he storms out of respect for its importance. The sentence is an interjection. He explained the reason for its permissibility by saying: ""Free a slave"" from slavery by freeing her. ""Or feed on a day of famine"" famine. ""An orphan of near kinship"" kinship. ""Or a poor person covered in dust"" stuck to the dust due to his poverty. In a reading instead of the two verbs, there are two raised sources, the first of which is added to a slave. The second is nunated, so it is understood that before the pass, storming was the case. The aforementioned reading explains it. ""Then he was"" is in apposition to stormed, and then is for the order of mention. The meaning is that at the time of storming, ""of those who believed and advised one another"" advised one another ""to patience"" in obedience and from disobedience ""and advised one another to compassion"" compassion towards creation. ""Those"" are described by these qualities ""are the companions of the right"" the right. ""And those who disbelieve in Our verses - they are the companions of the left"" the left. ""Upon them is a closed fire"" With hamza and waw, it is a complete substitute"
j-1229	"""And the sun and its brightness"" its light

""And the moon when it follows it"" follows it rising at its setting

""And the day when it displays it"" by rising

""And the night when it covers it"" covers it with its darkness. And ""if"" in the three is for the sake of circumstance and the factor in it is the action of the oath

""And the sky and He who constructed it""

""And the earth and He who spread it out"" spread it out

""And a soul"" meaning souls ""And He who proportioned it"" in creation and ""what"" in the three is a source or in the sense of ""who""

""And inspired it with its wickedness and its piety"" showed it the path of good and evil and delayed piety in order to take into account the beginnings of the verses and the answer to the oath

""He has succeeded"" the ""lam"" was deleted from it due to the length of the speech ""who purifies it"" purifies it from sins

""And he has failed"" lost ""whoever conceals it"" conceals it with disobedience and its origin is ""dasaha"" the second ""sin"" was replaced with an ""alif"" for the sake of lightening"
j-1230	"""Thamud denied"" their messenger Salih ""in their transgression"" because of their transgression
""When the most wretched of them"" whose name was Qidar, sent forth"" he rushed ""to hamstring the she-camel with their consent
""The Messenger of God"" Salih said to them ""The she-camel of God"" meaning leave her ""and give her drink"" she drank it in her day and she had a day and they had a day
""But they denied him"" in his saying that about God who ordered the punishment to descend upon them if they disobeyed him ""so they hamstrung her"" they killed her so that their drinking water would be spared ""so their Lord crushed"" the punishment ""over them for their sin and leveled it"" meaning the crushing over them, meaning it covered them with it so that none of them escaped
""nor"" with the waw and the fa ""feared its consequences"" it followed"
j-1231	"""And the night when it covers"" with its darkness everything between the heaven and the earth

""And the day when it appears"" is revealed and appears and if in the two subjects is merely circumstantial and the agent in it is the verb of the oath

""And what"" in the meaning of ""who"" or a source ""He created the male and the female"" Adam and Eve and every male and every female and the hermaphrodite who is unclear to us is male or female with God Almighty so he breaks his oath by speaking to him from the oath that he will not speak does not speak to a male or a female

""Indeed, your efforts"" your work ""are diverse"" different so a factor for Paradise is through obedience and a factor for Hell is through disobedience

""But as for him who gives"" the right of God ""and fears"" God
""and believes in the best"" that is, there is no god but God in the two subjects

""We will guide him to ease"" to Paradise"
j-1232	"""But as for him who is stingy"" with God's right ""and considers himself free"" of His reward

""and denies the best""

""We will drive him"" prepare him ""to hardship"" the Fire

""And his wealth will not avail him when he falls"" into the Fire"
j-1233	"""Indeed, upon Us is guidance"" to clarify the path of guidance from the path of misguidance so that our command to follow the first and we are forbidden from committing the second. ""And indeed, to Us are the Hereafter and the first"" meaning the world, so whoever seeks them from other than Us has erred. ""So I have warned you"" I have frightened you, O people of Mecca, ""of a blazing Fire"" by deleting one of the two ta's from the original and it was read with its presence, meaning it is blazing. ""None shall enter it"" it is included ""except the most wretched"" meaning the wretched one
who denied the Prophet and turned away from faith. This restriction is interpreted by the Almighty's saying: And He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills, so what is meant is the eternal burning. ""And he will avoid it"" he will distance himself from it ""the most pious"" meaning the pious one. ""He who gives his wealth to purify himself"" purified by it with Allah the Almighty by giving it to Allah the Almighty, not for show or reputation, so he will be pure with Allah. This was revealed about As-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) when he bought Bilal who was being tortured for his faith and freed him. The infidels said that he only did that for a favor he had with him, so it was revealed. ""And no one has a favor with Him for which he would be rewarded"" “Except” but he did that “seeking the countenance of his Lord, the Most High” meaning seeking the reward of God. “And he will be satisfied” with what he is given as reward in Paradise. The verse includes whoever does what he did, God Almighty will be pleased with him and will keep him away from the Fire and he will be rewarded."
j-1234	"""By the forenoon"" meaning the beginning of the day or all of it

""By the night when it covers with darkness"" covers you with its darkness or calms down

""Your Lord has not forsaken you"" has forsaken you, O Muhammad, ""nor has He detested you"" has He hated you. This was revealed when the disbelievers said when the revelation was delayed for fifteen days that his Lord had forsaken him and detested him

""And the Hereafter is better for you"" because of the honors it contains for you ""than the first"" this world

And your Lord will surely give you in the Hereafter a great gift of good things, and you will be satisfied with it. So the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: ""Then I will not be satisfied while one of my nation is in the Fire."" Up to here, the answer to the oath is complete with two affirmatives after two negatives."
j-1235	"""Did He not find you"" is an interrogative statement, meaning He found you ""an orphan"" due to the loss of your father before or after your birth ""and gave you shelter"" by taking you with your uncle Abu Talib

""And He found you astray"" from the Sharia you are following ""and guided"" meaning He guided you to it

And He found you poor and needy, so He enriched you with what He satisfied you with of booty and other things. In the hadith, wealth is not about abundance of possessions, but wealth is about wealth of soul

""As for the orphan, do not oppress"" by taking his money or other things

""And as for the beggar, do not repel him"" rebuke him for his poverty

""And as for the favor of your Lord"" upon you with prophethood and other things ""then report"" he informed and omitted his pronoun in some verbs to preserve the pauses"
j-1236	“Have We not expanded” is an interrogative statement, meaning, “have We not expanded for you,” O Muhammad, “your chest” with prophethood and other things. “And removed” did We remove “from you your burden” which weighed down your back. This is like the Almighty’s saying, “so that Allah may forgive you what came before of your sin.” “And raised high for you your remembrance” by mentioning you with My remembrance in the call to prayer, the call to prayer, the testimony of faith, the sermon, and other things.
j-1237	"""For indeed, with hardship"" severity ""will be ease"" ease ""For indeed, with hardship will be ease"" The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, suffered hardship from the infidels, then he achieved ease through his victory over them ""So when you have finished"" the prayer ""then devote yourself"" tire yourself out in supplication ""And to your Lord direct your longing"" humbly"
j-1238	"""And the fig and the olive"" meaning the edible ones or two mountains in the Levant that produce edible ones.

""And Mount Sinai"" the mountain on which God Almighty spoke to Moses. The meaning of Sinai is blessed or beautiful with fruitful trees.

""And this secure city"" Mecca because people were safe in it, in ignorance and Islam.

""Indeed, We created man"" the species ""in the best stature"" modifying his image.

""Then We returned him"" in some of his individuals ""to the lowest of the low"" a metaphor for old age and weakness, so the believer's work is less than the time of youth, and he will have his reward according to the Almighty's saying.

""Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds, for them is a reward uninterrupted and cut off. And in the hadith, if the believer reaches an old age that makes him unable to work, what he used to do is written for him."
j-1239	“So what makes you deny it,” O disbeliever, “after” after what was mentioned about the creation of man in the best form and then his return to the worst age, indicating the ability to resurrect, “with the religion” with the reward preceded by the resurrection and the reckoning, meaning what makes you deny that and not make it happen? Is not God the most just of judges? He is the most just of judges, and His judgment with the reward is from that. And in the hadith, whoever recites “By the Fig” to the end of it, let him say, “Yes, and I am of that among the witnesses.”
j-1240	"“Read” find the reading beginning “in the name of your Lord who created” the creatures
“created man” the species “from a clot” the plural of a clot which is a small piece of thick blood
“Read” confirming the first “and your Lord is the most generous” who is not comparable to generous is a state of the pronoun read
“who taught” writing “with the pen” and the first to write with it was Idris, peace be upon him
“taught man” the species “that which he did not know” before teaching him guidance, writing, industry and other things"
j-1241	"“No indeed, man transgresses”
“Because he sees himself” meaning himself “rich” with money. It was revealed about Abu Jahl. “He saw himself” meaning himself “rich” is a second object and “because he saw himself” is an object for it. “Indeed, to your Lord” O man “is the return” meaning the return is a warning to him, so He will reward the transgressor with what he deserves."
j-1242	"""Have you seen"" in the three places for astonishment ""who forbids"" is Abu Jahl
""a slave"" is the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace ""when he prays""
""Have you seen if"" the one who is forbidden ""is on the right path""
""or"" for division ""enjoins piety""
""Have you seen if"" that is the one who forbids is the Prophet ""and turns away"" from faith?
""Does he not know that God sees"" what he has done, that is, knows it and punishes him for it? That is, I am astonished by him, O you who are being addressed, in terms of his forbidding prayer and in terms of the one who is forbidden on the right path enjoining piety and in terms of the one who forbids is a liar who has turned away from faith?
""No"" is a deterrent to him. ""If"" the lam of an oath ""he does not desist"" from what he is doing of disbelief ""We will surely drag him by the forelock"" We will drag him by the forelock into the Fire.
""Forelock"" is an indefinite substitute for a definite ""lying, sinful"" He described it thus metaphorically and what is meant is its owner.
""Then let him call his group"" that is, the people of his group, which is the assembly in which people gather and talk. He had said to the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, when he rebuked him Where he forbade him from praying, I know that there is no man with a greater club than me. I will fill this valley for you, if you wish, with bare horses and strong men. We will call the angels, the stern and strong ones, to destroy him, as in the hadith. If he had called his club, the angels would have seized him in plain sight. “No,” he deterred him. “Do not obey him,” O Muhammad, in abandoning prayer, “but prostrate,” pray to God, “and draw near” to Him by obeying Him."
j-1243	"“Indeed, We sent it down” meaning the Qur’an as a whole from the Preserved Tablet to the lowest heaven “during the Night of Decree” meaning the great honor

“And what will make you know” I will inform you, O Muhammad, “what is the Night of Decree” magnifying its importance and expressing wonder at it

“The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months” not including the Night of Decree, so righteous deeds in it are better than a thousand months not including them

“The angels and the Spirit” meaning Gabriel “descend therein” in the night “by permission of their Lord” by His command “for every matter” that God has decreed therein for that year until the next and from its two causes with the meaning of the ba

“Peace is it” advanced news and subject “until the break of dawn” with the opening of the lam and its breaking until the time of its break, it was made peace because of the abundance of peace in it from the angels, they do not pass a believing man or woman except that they greet him"
j-1244	"“Those who disbelieved from among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists” meaning the idol worshippers, in apposition to the people, “would not depart” is the predicate of “Yakun” meaning they would depart from what they were upon “until there came to them” meaning the clear proof came to them, which is Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace

“A Messenger from God” is a substitute for the proof, which is the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, “reciting purified pages” from falsehood

And that is the religion” of the “right” religion."
j-1245	“Indeed, those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein.” This is a predicated state, meaning that their eternity in it is predicated by God Almighty. “Those are the worst of creation.” “Indeed, those who believed and did righteous deeds - those are the best of creation.” “Their reward is with their Lord: Gardens of Eden,” a residence, “underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. God is pleased with them,” through His obedience, “and they are pleased with Him,” through His reward. “That is for him who fears his Lord,” fears His punishment and refrains from disobeying Him Almighty.

The Arabs came to him from all corners of the earth, obediently. “Then glorify the praises of your Lord” meaning, clothed in His praise “and seek His forgiveness. Indeed, He is ever Forgiving.” After the revelation of this surah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, he would often say “Glory be to Allah and with His praise, I seek Allah’s forgiveness and I repent to Him.” He knew from it that his time had drawn near.

Is this why you called us?” “Tabbat” was revealed. “The hands of Abu Lahab” means his whole body. He expressed it with the two hands metaphorically because most actions are performed with them. This whole body is a supplication. “And he perished” means he lost. This is a piece of news like their saying, “May God destroy him,” and he was destroyed. When the Prophet threatened him with punishment, he said, “If my nephew is truly me, then I will ransom myself from him with my wealth and my children,” was revealed. “His wealth and what he earned will not avail him.” “His wealth and what he earned will not avail him,” meaning his earnings, meaning his children, will not avail, meaning will avail. “He will burn in a Fire of flame,” meaning it will burn and kindle, so it is the destination of his nickname, to burn his face with brightness and redness. “And his wife” is an appositive to the pronoun “prays,” which is permitted by the separation with the object and its description, which is Umm Jamil. “Carrier” in the nominative and accusative cases. “Firewood” means thorns and sa’dan, which she throws in the path of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace. “On her neck” means her neck. ""A rope of palm fibre"" meaning fibres. This sentence is a state of the firewood carrier, which is an attribute of his wife or the predicate of an implied subject."
j-1263	The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, was asked about his Lord, so “Say, He is God, the One” was revealed. So God is the predicate of “He” and “One” is a substitute for it or a second predicate. “God, the Eternal Refuge” is the subject and predicate, meaning the one who is always intended in needs. “He did not beget” because there is no similarity to Him. “And He was not begotten” because there is no occurrence from Him. “And there is none comparable to Him” meaning equal or similar. “For Him” is related to “are comparable” and it was presented before it because it is the focus of the negation. “One” was delayed, which is the name of “Bekane” from its predicate, in order to preserve the comma.
j-1264	"“Say, ‘I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak’ from the evil of that which He has created, from animals that are charged and those that are not, and inanimate objects such as poison and others. 

“And from the evil of darkness when it comes,” meaning the night when it darkens and the moon when it sets. 

“And from the evil of the blowers,” the witches who blow “into knots,” who tie them in a thread, blowing into them with something they say without saliva. Al-Zamakhshari said with him, like the daughters of the aforementioned Labid. 

“And from the evil of an envier when he envies,” he showed his envy and acted upon it, like the aforementioned Labid from the Jews who envied the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace. He mentioned the three, which include what was created after him, due to the severity of their evil."
j-1265	"""Say, I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind"" Their Creator and Owner They were specifically mentioned to honor them and to benefit from the evil of the whisperer in their hearts

""King of mankind""

""God of mankind"" as two substitutes or two attributes or an explanatory apposition and the complement to them is made clearer for the sake of clarification

""From the evil of the whisperer"" The devil is called the event because of his frequent association with it ""The Retreater"" because he retreats and retreats from the heart whenever God is mentioned

""Who whispers in the breasts of mankind"" Their hearts if they are heedless of the remembrance of God
""From the jinn and the people"" is a clarification of the whispering devil that he is a jinn and a human being like the Almighty's saying ""devils of mankind and jinn"" or ""From the jinn"" is a clarification of him and the people is an apposition to the whisperer and to each is included the evil of Labid and his daughters mentioned and the first objected that people do not whisper in their breasts, rather the jinn whisper in their breasts and it was answered that people also whisper in a meaning that suits them in appearance then their whispering reaches the heart and is established in it by the path that leads to that and God Almighty knows best"
