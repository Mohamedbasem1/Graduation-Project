1:1-4	In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds. The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Master of the Day of Judgment.
1:5-6	You alone do we worship, and You alone do we ask for help. Guide us to the straight path.
1:7-7	The path of those upon whom You have bestowed favor, not of those who have incurred Your wrath nor of those who have gone astray.
2:1-2	Alif, Lam, Meem. This is the Book about which there is no doubt, a guidance for those conscious of Allah.
2:3-5	Those who believe in the unseen, establish prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them. And those who believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith]. Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.
2:6-7	Indeed, those who disbelieve - it is all the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe. Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment.
2:8-16	"Among the people are those who say, ""We believe in Allah and the Last Day,"" while they are not believers. They seek to deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive only themselves and perceive [it] not. In their hearts is disease, so Allah has increased their disease; and for them is a painful punishment because they [habitually] used to lie. And when it is said to them, ""Do not cause corruption on the earth,"" they say, ""We are only reformers."" Unquestionably, it is they who are the corrupters, but they perceive [it] not. And when it is said to them, ""Believe as the people have believed,"" they say, ""Should we believe as the fools have believed?"" Unquestionably, it is they who are the fools, but they do not know. And when they meet those who believe, they say, ""We believe,"" but when they are alone with their evil ones, they say, ""Indeed, we are with you; we were only mocking."" Allah mocks at them and prolongs them in their transgression while they wander blindly. Those are the ones who have purchased error in place of guidance. So their transaction brings no profit, nor were they guided."
2:17-20	Their parable is that of one who kindled a fire, but when it illuminated what was around him, Allah took away their light and left them in darknesses [so] they cannot see. Deaf, dumb, and blind, so they will not return. Or [the example of] a rainstorm from the sky in which is darkness and thunder and lightning. They put their fingers in their ears because of the thunderclaps, for fear of death. And Allah encompasses the disbelievers. The lightning almost snatches away their sight. Whenever it lights up for them, they walk therein, but when darkness covers them, they stand still. And if Allah had willed, He could have taken away their hearing and their sight. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.
2:21-22	O mankind, worship your Lord, who created you and those before you, that you may become righteous. He who made for you the earth a resting place and the sky a canopy and sent down water from the sky and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. So do not attribute to God equals while you know.
2:23-24	And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant, then produce a surah the like thereof and call upon your witnesses other than Allah, if you should be truthful. But if you do not - and you will never be able to - then fear the Fire whose fuel is men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.
2:25-25	And give good tidings to those who believe and do righteous deeds that they will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. Whenever they are provided with a fruit therefrom as provision, they will say, “This is what we were provided with before.” And they will be given something similar to it. And they will have therein purified spouses, and they will abide therein eternally.
2:26-27	"Indeed, Allah is not ashamed to present an example - that of a gnat or anything larger than that. As for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. But as for those who disbelieve, they say, ""What does Allah intend by this as an example?"" He misleads many thereby and guides many thereby. And He misleads not thereby except the defiantly disobedient. Those who break the covenant of Allah after its ratification and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and spread corruption on earth - those are the losers."
2:28-29	How do you disbelieve in Allah while you were dead and He gave you life? Then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you to life, and then to Him you will be returned. It is He who created for you all that is on the earth. Then He directed Himself to the heaven, and made them seven heavens. And He is Knowing of all things.
2:30-33	"And remember when your Lord said to the angels, ""Indeed, I am going to place upon the earth a successive authority."" They said, ""Will You place upon it one who will cause corruption therein and shed blood, while we exalt [Allah] with praise and sanctify You?"" He said, ""Indeed, I know that which you do not know."" And He taught Adam the names - all of them. Then he showed them to the angels and said, ""Inform Me of the names of these, if you should be truthful."" They said, ""Exalted are You! We have no knowledge except what You have taught us. Indeed, it is You who is the Knowing, the Wise."" He said, ""O Adam, inform them of their names."" And when he had informed them of their names, He said, ""Did I not tell you that I know the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth and I know what you reveal and what you conceal?"""
2:34-39	"And remember when We said to the angels, ""Prostrate to Adam,"" and they prostrated, except for Iblis. He refused and was arrogant and became of the disbelievers. And We said, ""O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat from it in abundance as you wish. But do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers."" But Satan caused them to slip therefrom and removed them from that in which they were. And We said, ""Go down, some of you as enemies to others. And you will have upon the earth a settlement and provision for a time."" So Adam received from his Lord words, and He accepted his repentance. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful. We said, ""Go down from it, all of you. And if there comes to you guidance from Me - whoever follows My guidance - there will be no fear concerning them, nor will they grieve. But those who disbelieve and deny Our verses - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally."
2:40-48	O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and fulfill My covenant, and I will fulfill My covenant with you, and fear only Me. And believe in what I revealed, confirming that which is with you, and do not be the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My verses for a small price, and fear only Me. And do not mix truth with falsehood or conceal the truth while you know. And establish prayer and give zakah and bow with those who bow. Do you enjoin righteousness upon the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason? And seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive - Who are certain that they will meet their Lord and that they will return to Him. O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds. And fear a Day when no soul will avail another soul at all, and no intercession will be accepted from it, and no compensation will be taken from it, and they will not be aided.
2:49-52	And when We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst of torment, slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. And in that was a great trial from your Lord. And when We parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people of Pharaoh while you were looking on. And when We appointed for Moses forty nights, then you took the calf after him while you were wrongdoers. Then We pardoned you after that that perhaps you would be grateful.
2:53-57	"And [mention] when We gave Moses the Scripture and the Criterion that you might be guided. And [mention] when Moses said to his people, ""O my people, indeed you have wronged yourselves by taking the calf, so repent to your Creator and kill yourselves. That is better for you in the sight of your Creator."" So He turned to you in forgiveness. Indeed, it is He who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful. And [mention] when you said, ""O Moses, we will not believe you until we see Allah with our own eyes,"" and the thunderbolt seized you while you were looking on. Then We revived you after your death that perhaps you would be grateful. And We shaded you with clouds and sent down to you manna and quails, ""Eat from the good things with which We have provided you."" And they wronged Us not, but they were wronging themselves."
2:58-59	"And remember when We said, ""Enter this city and eat from it as you wish in abundance and enter the gate bowing down and say, 'Forgive us.' We will forgive you your sins and increase the doers of good."" But those who did wrong substituted another statement other than that which had been said to them. So We sent down upon those who did wrong a punishment from the sky because they were defiantly disobedient."
2:60-62	"And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said, ""Strike the rock with your staff."" Then twelve springs gushed forth from it. Every people knew their drinking place. ""Eat and drink from the provision of Allah and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption."" And when you said, ""O Moses, we will never endure one kind of food, so call upon your Lord to produce for us from what the earth grows of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions."" He said, ""Will you exchange that which is better for that which is less good? Go down to Egypt, for you will have what you asked for."" And humiliation and poverty were imposed upon them, and they incurred wrath from Allah. That was because they disbelieved in the verses of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That was because they disobeyed and were transgressors. Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans - those who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness - will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve."
2:63-66	And [mention] when We took your covenant and raised the mount above you, [saying], “Take what We have given you with strength and remember what is in it that you may become righteous.” Then you turned away after that. And had it not been for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have been among the losers. And you certainly knew those among you who transgressed concerning the Sabbath, so We said to them, “Be apes, despised.” So We made it a deterrent to those before it and those after it and an instruction to the righteous.
2:67-73	"And remember when Moses said to his people, ""Indeed, Allah commands you to slaughter a cow."" They said, ""Do you take us in mockery?"" He said, ""I seek refuge in Allah from being among the ignorant."" They said, ""Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is."" He said, ""He says that it is a cow neither old nor young, but between that. So do as you are commanded."" They said, ""Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what its color is."" He said, ""He says that it is a yellow cow, bright in color, pleasing to the observers."" They said, ""Call upon your Lord to make clear to us what it is. Indeed, cows seem alike to us, and indeed, if Allah wills, we will be guided."" He said, ""He says that it is a cow neither trained to plow the earth nor irrigate the crops, sound, without blemish on it."" They said, ""Now you have brought forth the truth."" So they slaughtered it, but they were not about to do so. And when you killed a person and disputed over it, and Allah will bring out that which you were concealing. So We said, ""Strike him with part of it."" Thus does Allah bring the dead to life and show you His signs that you may understand."
2:74-75	Then your hearts hardened after that, so they are like stones or even harder. And indeed, among the stones are those from which rivers burst forth, and among them are those which split open and water issues from them, and among them are those which fall down for fear of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what you do. Do you then hope that they will believe in you while a party of them used to hear the Word of Allah and then distort it after they had understood it while they knew?
2:76-77	"And when they meet those who believe, they say, ""We believe,"" but when they are alone with one another, they say, ""Do you tell them what Allah has disclosed to you so that they may dispute with you about it before your Lord? Then will you not reason?"" Do they not know that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare?"
2:78-79	And among them are unlettered people who do not know the Scripture except in wishful thinking, and they do nothing but conjecture. So woe to those who write the Scripture with their own hands and then say, “This is from God,” in order to exchange it for a small price. Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for what they earn.
2:80-82	"And they say, ""The Fire will not touch us except for a few days."" Say, ""Have you taken a covenant from Allah - Allah will never break His covenant - or are you saying about Allah that which you do not know?"" But whoever earns evil and his sin encompasses him - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. But those who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally."
2:83-86	"And [mention] when We took a covenant from the Children of Israel, [saying], ""Worship none but Allah, and to parents do good, and to relatives, orphans, and the needy, and speak to people good words and establish prayer and give zakah."" Then you turned away, except for a few of you, and you were averse. And [mention] when We took a covenant from you, ""You shall not shed one another's blood, nor expel one another from your homes."" Then you acknowledged, while you were witnesses. Then you [even] kill yourselves and expel a party of you from their homes, supporting one another against them in sin and aggression. And if they come to you as captives, you ransom them, although their expulsion was forbidden to you. Then what is the reward of those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life? And on the Day of Resurrection they will be returned to the severest of the punishment. And Allah is not unaware of what you do. Those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter. So the punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be aided."
2:87-88	"And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture and followed him up with other messengers. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. Then is it that whenever there came to you a messenger with what your souls did not desire, you were arrogant? So a party you denied and a party you killed. And they said, ""Our hearts are covered."" Rather, Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so little do they believe."
2:89-90	And when there came to them a Book from Allah confirming what was with them - although before they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieved - but when there came to them that which they recognized, they disbelieved in it. So the curse of Allah is upon the disbelievers. Evil is that for which they have sold themselves - that they should disbelieve in what Allah has revealed, out of envy that Allah should send down of His bounty upon whom He wills of His servants. So they incurred wrath upon wrath, and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment.
2:91-93	"And when it is said to them, ""Believe in what Allah has revealed,"" they say, ""We believe in what was revealed to us,"" and they disbelieve in what came after it, although it is the truth confirming what is with them. Say, ""Then why did you kill the prophets of Allah before, if you were believers? And indeed, Moses came to you with clear proofs; then you took the calf after him, while you were wrongdoers. And [mention] when We took a covenant from you and raised the mount above you, [saying], ""Take what We have given you with determination and listen,"" they say, ""We hear and disobey."" And they were made to drink into their hearts the image of the calf because of their disbelief. Say, ""Evil is that which your faith enjoins upon you, if you are believers."""
2:94-96	"Say, ""If the home of the Hereafter with Allah is exclusively yours, to the exclusion of all other people, then wish for death, if you should be truthful."" But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers. And you will find them, of people, the greediest of all for life - even more than those who associate others with Allah. One of them would like to live a thousand years, but that living a thousand years will not remove him from the punishment. And Allah is Seeing of what they do."
2:97-98	"Say, ""Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel - indeed, he has brought the Qur'an down to your heart by permission of Allah, confirming what was before it and as guidance and good tidings for the believers. Whoever is an enemy to Allah and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel and Michael - then indeed, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers."
2:99-101	And We have certainly sent down to you, [O Muhammad], clear verses, and none disbelieves in them except the defiantly disobedient. Every time they make a covenant, a party of them throws it aside. Rather, most of them do not believe. And when there came to them a messenger from Allah confirming what was with them, a party of those who were given the Scripture threw the Book of Allah behind their backs as if they did not know.
2:102-103	"And they followed what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But these two angels did not teach anyone until they had said, ""We are only a trial, so do not disbelieve."" And they learned from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they could not harm thereby anyone except by permission of Allah. And they learned that which harms them and does not benefit them. And they certainly knew that whoever buys it will have no share in the Hereafter. And evil is that for which they have sold themselves, if they only knew. And if they had believed and feared Allah, the reward from Allah would have been better, if they only knew."
2:104-105	"O you who have believed, do not say, ""Ra'ina,"" but say, ""Unzurna,"" and listen. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment. Those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists do not like that any good should come down to you from your Lord. And God chooses for His mercy whom He wills, and God is the possessor of great bounty."
2:106-108	Whatever verse We abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring [one] better than it or similar to it. Do you not know that Allah has power over all things? Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and that you have not besides Allah any protector or helper? Or do you want to question your Messenger as Moses was asked before? And whoever exchanges faith for disbelief has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way.
2:109-110	Many of the People of the Scripture wish they could turn you back to disbelief after you have believed, out of envy from themselves [in their hearts] after the truth has become clear to them. So pardon and overlook until Allah delivers His command. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. And establish prayer and give zakah, and whatever good you put forward for yourselves - you will find it with Allah. Indeed, Allah, of what you do, is Seeing.
2:111-112	"And they say, ""None will enter Paradise except he who is a Jew or a Christian."" Those are their desires. Say, ""Produce your proof, if you should be truthful."" But whoever submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good will have his reward with his Lord. And no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve."
2:113-113	"The Jews say, ""The Christians have nothing,"" and the Christians say, ""The Jews have nothing,"" while they recite the Scripture. Thus say those who do not know like their statement. So God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ."
2:114-115	And who is more unjust than he who prevents the name of Allah from being mentioned in the mosques of Allah and strives toward their destruction? It is not for them to enter them except in fear. For them in this world is disgrace, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment. And to Allah belong the East and the West, so wherever you turn, there is the Face of Allah. Indeed, Allah is All-Encompassing and Knowing.
2:116-119	"And they say, ""God has taken a son."" Glory be to Him! Rather, to Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient to Him. Originator of the heavens and the earth. And when He decrees a matter, He only says to it, ""Be,"" and it is. And those who do not know say, ""Why does God not speak to us or a sign not come to us?"" Thus said those before them the like of their statement. Their hearts are alike. We have certainly made clear the verses for a people who are certain [in faith]. Indeed, We have sent you, [O Muhammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And do not ask about the companions of Hellfire."
2:120-121	"And never will the Jews or the Christians be pleased with you until you follow their religion. Say, ""Indeed, the guidance of Allah is the [only] guidance."" And if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against Allah neither protector nor helper. Those to whom We have given the Scripture recite it with its true recital - those believe in it. But whoever disbelieves in it - those are the losers."
2:122-123	O Children of Israel, remember My favor which I bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the worlds. And fear a Day when no soul will avail another soul at all, nor will compensation be accepted from it, nor will intercession benefit it, nor will they be aided.
2:124-129	"And when his Lord tested Abraham with certain commands, and he fulfilled them, He said, ""Indeed, I will make you a leader for mankind."" He said, ""And of my descendants?"" He said, ""My covenant does not include the wrongdoers."" And when We made the House a resort for mankind and a place of safety. And take, [O Muhammad], the standing place of Abraham as a place of prayer. And We charged Abraham and Ishmael, ""Purify My House for those who perform Tawaf, and those who stay there, and those who bow and prostrate."" And when Abraham said, ""My Lord, make this a secure city and provide its people with fruits - whoever of them believes in Allah and the Last Day."" He said, ""And whoever disbelieves - I will grant him enjoyment for a little; then I will force him to the punishment of the Fire, and wretched is the destination."" And when Abraham and Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House, ""Our Lord, accept from us. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing. Our Lord, and make us Muslims [in submission] to You and from our descendants a nation Muslims [in submission] to You. And show us our rites and accept our repentance. Indeed, You are the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful."" Our Lord, and raise among them a messenger from themselves who will recite to them Your verses and teach them the Book and wisdom and purify them. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise."""
2:130-134	"And who would abandon the religion of Abraham except one who makes a fool of himself? And We had chosen him in this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him, ""Submit,"" he said, ""I have submitted to the Lord of the worlds."" And Abraham enjoined this upon his sons and [so did] Jacob, ""O my sons, indeed Allah has chosen for you this religion, so do not die except as Muslims."" Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob, when he said to his sons, ""What will you worship after me?"" They said, ""We will worship your God and the God of your fathers - Abraham, Ishmael and Isaac - one God; and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."" That was a people that has passed on. It shall have what it earned, and you shall have what you earn. And you will not be asked about what they used to do."
2:135-138	"And they say, ""Be Jews or Christians [so] you will be guided."" Say, ""Rather, [we] follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth, and he was not of the polytheists."" Say, ""We believe in God and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in what was given to Moses and Jesus and what was given to the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."" So if they believe in the same as you believe, then they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, then they are only in dissension. So God will suffice you against them. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing. [The religion of] God - and who is better than God in religion? And we are to Him [in worship]."
2:139-141	"Say, ""Do you dispute with us about Allah while He is our Lord and your Lord? And to us shall be our deeds, and to you shall be your deeds; and we are sincere to Him. Or do you say that Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes were Jews or Christians?"" Say, ""Are you more knowing or Allah?"" And who is more unjust than he who conceals a testimony he has from Allah? And Allah is not unaware of what you do. That was a people which has passed on. It shall have what it earned, and you shall have what you have earned. And you will not be asked about what they used to do."""
2:142-145	"The foolish among the people will say, ""What has turned them away from the qiblah which they used to face?"" Say, ""To Allah belong the East and the West. He guides whom He wills to a straight path."" And thus We have made you a just community that you will be witnesses over the people and the Messenger will be a witness over you. And We did not make the qiblah which you used to face except that We might make evident who follows the Messenger from who turns on his heels. And indeed, it is difficult except for those whom Allah has guided. And Allah would never let your faith go to waste. Indeed, Allah, to the people, is Kind and Merciful. We have certainly seen the turning of your face toward the heaven. So We will surely turn you to a qiblah with which you will be pleased. So turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you are, turn your faces toward it. And indeed, those who were given the Scripture know that it is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do. And even if you brought to those who were given the Scripture every sign, they would not follow your qiblah, nor will you follow their qiblah, nor will some of them follow the qiblah of others. And if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, indeed, you would then be among the wrongdoers."
2:146-150	Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognize him as they recognize their own sons. But indeed, a party of them conceal the truth while they know. The truth is from your Lord, so never be among the doubters. And to each is a direction toward which he turns, so race toward good. Wherever you may be, Allah will bring you all together. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. And from wherever you go out, turn your face toward al-Masjid al-Haram. And wherever you are, turn your faces toward it so that people will have no argument against you, except for those who do wrong among them. So do not fear them but fear Me, and I will complete My favor upon you that you may be guided.
2:151-153	Just as We have sent among you a Messenger from among you who recites to you Our verses and purifies you and teaches you the Book and wisdom and teaches you that which you did not know. So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me. O you who have believed, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient.
2:154-157	"And do not say of those who are killed in the way of Allah, ""They are dead."" Rather, they are alive, but you perceive [it] not. And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits, but give good tidings to the patient - Who, when disaster strikes them, say, ""Indeed we belong to Allah, and indeed to Him we will return."" Those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy. And it is those who are the [rightly] guided."
2:158-158	Indeed, As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the symbols of Allah. So whoever makes Hajj to the House or performs Umrah - there is no blame upon him for walking between them. And whoever volunteers good - then indeed, Allah is appreciative and Knowing.
2:159-162	Indeed, those who conceal what We sent down of clear proofs and guidance after We made it clear for the people in the Scripture - those are cursed by Allah and cursed by those who curse. Except for those who repent, amend, and declare [the truth]. For those, I will turn in forgiveness, and I am the Accepter of repentance, the Most Merciful. Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - upon them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of mankind, all together. They will abide therein eternally. Their punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved.
2:163-164	And your God is one God; there is no god but He - the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day and the [great] ships which sail through the sea with that which benefits people and what God sends down from the sky of water, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and dispersing therein every [kind of] moving creature and [His] directing of the winds and the clouds controlled between the heaven and the earth are signs for a people who reason.
2:165-167	"And among mankind are those who take for themselves rivals to Allah, loving them as they love Allah. But those who believe are stronger in love for Allah. And if only those who did wrong would see when they see the punishment that all power belongs to Allah and that Allah is severe in punishment. When those who followed disown those who followed, and they see the punishment, and all ties are severed between them. And those who followed say, ""If only we could have another turn, we could disown them as they disowned us."" Thus will Allah show them their deeds as regrets for them, and they will not emerge from the Fire."
2:168-169	O mankind, eat from whatever is on the earth [that is] lawful and good and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy. He only commands you to evil and immorality and to say about Allah that which you do not know.
2:170-171	"And when it is said to them, ""Follow what Allah has revealed,"" they say, ""Rather, we will follow that which we found our fathers doing."" Even though their fathers did not understand anything, nor were they guided? And the parable of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts to that which hears nothing except calls and cries. Deaf, dumb, and blind - so they do not use reason."
2:172-173	O you who have believed, eat from the good things which We have provided for you and be grateful to Allah if it is Him that you worship. He has only forbidden you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limits], there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
2:174-176	Indeed, those who conceal what Allah has revealed of the Book and exchange it for a small price - those eat nothing into their bellies except the Fire. And Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them, and they will have a painful punishment. Those are the ones who have purchased error at the price of guidance and punishment at the price of forgiveness. So how patient they are toward the Fire! That is because Allah has sent down the Book in truth. And indeed, those who differ over the Book are in extreme dissension.
2:177-177	Righteousness is not that you turn your faces toward the east or the west, but righteous is he who believes in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Book and the prophets and gives wealth, in spite of love for Him, to relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler and those who ask [for help] and for the freeing of slaves and establishes prayer and gives zakah and fulfills their covenant when they have made a covenant and is patient in poverty and hardship and during battle. Those are the ones who are true, and those are the righteous.
2:178-179	O you who have believed, prescribed for you is legal retribution for those murdered - the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the female for the female. But whoever pardons anything from his brother, there should be a reasonable follow-up and payment to him with good conduct. That is an alleviation from your Lord and a mercy. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment. And there is life for you in legal retribution, O you of understanding, that you may become righteous.
2:180-182	It is prescribed for you, when death approaches any of you if he leaves goods, to make a bequest to parents and relatives according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous. But whoever alters it after he has heard it - then the sin is only upon those who have altered it. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing. But whoever fears injustice or sin on the part of a testator and brings about reconciliation between them - there is no sin upon him. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
2:183-186	O you who have believed, decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous. [Fasting] for a specified number of days. But whoever among you is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. And for those who can do it (with difficulty) - a ransom [is] the feeding of a poor person. But whoever volunteers good - it is better for him. And that you fast is better for you, if you only knew. The month of Ramadan is that in which was revealed the Qur’an, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs of guidance and criterion. So whoever sights the month - let him fast it. And whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days. Allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [that] you should complete the number and glorify Allah for having guided you; and perhaps you will be grateful. And when My servants ask you concerning Me - indeed I am near. I respond to the invocation of the supplicant when he calls upon Me. So let them respond to Me [by obedience] and believe in Me that they may be [rightly] guided.
2:187-187	Lawful to you on the night of the fast is the approach to your wives. They are your clothing and you are their clothing. Allah knows that you were deceiving yourselves, so He has turned to you in forgiveness and pardoned you. So now have intercourse with them and seek what Allah has ordained for you. And eat and drink until the white thread of dawn becomes distinct to you from the black thread [of night]. Then complete the fast until the nightfall. And do not have intercourse with them while you are staying for worship in the mosques. These are the limits set by Allah, so do not approach them. Thus does Allah make clear His verses to the people that they may fear Allah.
2:188-188	And do not consume one another's wealth unjustly or send it [in bribery] to the rulers in order to consume a portion of the wealth of the people in sin while you know.
2:189-189	They ask you about the new moons. Say, “They are measurements of time for the people and for Hajj. Righteousness is not that you enter houses from their backs, but righteousness is of him who fears God. And enter houses from their doors and fear God that you may be successful.”
2:190-194	And fight in the way of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress. Indeed. Allah does not like transgressors. And kill them wherever you overtake them and expel them from where they have expelled you, and persecution is worse than killing. And do not fight them at al-Masjid al-Haram until they fight you therein. But if they fight you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of disbelievers. But if they desist, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And fight them until there is no more persecution and religion is for Allah alone. But if they desist, then there is no aggression except against the wrongdoers. The sacred month is for the sacred month, and [there is] retribution for [all] sacred things. So whoever transgresses against you, transgress against him in proportion to his transgression against you. And fear Allah and know that Allah is with the righteous.
2:195-195	And spend in the cause of Allah and do not throw [yourselves] with your [own] hands into destruction [by refraining]. And do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good.
2:196-203	"And complete the Hajj and Umrah for Allah. But if you are prevented, then [sacrifice] whatever is feasible of sacrificial animals. And do not shave your heads until the sacrificial animals reach their destination. But whoever among you is ill or has an ailment of the head [must offer] a ransom of fasting or charity or sacrifice. But when you are secure, whoever performs the Umrah during the Hajj [must perform it], then whatever is feasible of sacrificial animals. But whoever cannot find [any] [obligatory], then a fast of three days during the Hajj and seven when you have returned. That is ten complete. That is for those whose families are not present at al-Masjid al-Haram. And fear Allah and know that Allah is severe in penalty. The Hajj is [during] well-known months. So whoever has made Hajj obligatory upon himself therein, there is no sexual relations nor disobedience nor disputing during Hajj. And whatever good you do - Allah knows it. And take provisions, but indeed, the best provision is fear of Allah. And fear Allah, O you of understanding. There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord. So when you depart from Arafat, remember Allah at al-Mash'ar al-Haram and remember Him as He has guided you, although you were before that among those who went astray. Then depart from where the people depart and ask forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. So when you have completed your rites, remember Allah as you remember your fathers or with a greater remembrance. Among the people is he who says, ""Our Lord, give us in this world,"" but he will have no share in the Hereafter. And among them is he who says, ""Our Lord, give us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter [that which is] good and protect us from the punishment of the Fire."" Those will have a share of what they have earned, and Allah is swift in account. And remember Allah during the appointed days. And whoever hastens [to do so] in two days - there is no sin upon him, and whoever delays - there is no sin upon him - for him who fears Allah. And fear Allah and know that to Him you will be gathered."
2:204-207	"Among the people is he whose speech pleases you in worldly life, and he calls Allah to witness as to what is in his heart, yet he is the most hostile of adversaries. And when he turns away, he strives throughout the land to cause corruption therein and destroy crops and animals. And Allah does not like corruption. And when it is said to him, ""Fear Allah,"" pride in his sin takes hold of him. Sufficient for him is Hell, and wretched is the resting place. And among the people is he who sells himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah. And Allah is Kind to His servants."
2:208-210	O you who have believed, enter into Islam completely and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy. But if you slip after the clear proofs have come to you, then know that Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. Do they await anything but that Allah should come to them in canopies of clouds and the angels and the matter has been decided? And to Allah are all matters returned.
2:211-212	Ask the Children of Israel how many clear signs We gave them. And whoever alters the favor of Allah after it has come to him - then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty. The life of this world has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they ridicule those who believe. But those who fear Allah will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah provides for whom He wills without account.
2:213-214	"Mankind was one community, then Allah sent the prophets as bringers of good tidings and warners, and He sent down with them the Scripture in truth to judge between the people concerning that in which they differed. And none differed therein except those who were given it after clear proofs had come to them, out of jealous animosity between themselves. So Allah guided those who believed to the truth concerning that in which they differed, by His permission. And Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path. Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while such [trial] has not yet come to you as came to those who passed on before you? They were afflicted with poverty and hardship and were shaken until the Messenger and those who believed with him said, ""When is the help of Allah?"" Unquestionably, the help of Allah is near."
2:215-215	They ask you, [O Muhammad], what they should spend. Say, “Whatever you spend of good is for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler. And whatever you do of good - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it.”
2:216-218	"Fighting has been enjoined upon you, though it is hateful to you. But perhaps you hate a thing and it is good for you; and perhaps you love a thing and it is bad for you. Allah knows, while you do not know. They ask you, [O Muhammad], about fighting therein. Say, ""Fighting therein is a great sin. But averting people from the way of Allah and disbelief in Him and al-Masjid al-Haram and expelling its people therefrom are greater sins in the sight of Allah. And persecution is greater than killing. And they will not cease to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able. And whoever of you reverts from his religion and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter. And those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. Indeed, those who have believed and those who have emigrated and striven in the cause of Allah - those are the ones who expect the mercy of Allah. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."""
2:219-219	They ask you about wine and gambling. Say, “In them is great sin and [yet, some] benefit for people. But their sin is greater than their benefit.” And they ask you, what they should spend. Say, “The excess.” Thus does God make clear to you the verses that you may give thought.
2:220-221	"In this world and in the Hereafter. And they ask you about orphans. Say, ""Improvement for them is best. But if you mix with them [orphans], they are your brothers. And Allah knows the corrupter from the reformer. And if Allah had willed, He could have made you suffer. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. And do not marry polytheistic women until they believe. And a believing slave woman is better than a polytheist, even if she pleases you. And do not marry polytheistic men until they believe. And a believing slave is better than a polytheist, even if he pleases you. Those invite [others] to the Fire, but Allah invites to Paradise and forgiveness, by His permission. And He makes clear His verses to the people that perhaps they will be reminded."
2:222-223	"They ask you about menstruation. Say, ""It is a harmful time, so keep away from women during menstruation and do not approach them until they are pure. And when they have purified themselves, then come to them from where Allah has ordained for you. Indeed, Allah loves those who are constantly repentant and loves those who purify themselves. Your women are as a tilth unto you, so come to your tilth when or how ye will, but put things forward for yourselves. And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him. And give good tidings to the believers."
2:224-225	And do not make Allah an excuse for your oaths to prevent you from being righteous and fearing Allah and making peace between people. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for what your hearts have earned. And Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing.
2:226-227	For those who swear off their wives, a waiting period of four months is required. If they return, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. But if they decide on divorce, then indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
2:228-230	Divorced women shall wait concerning themselves three menstrual periods. It is not lawful for them to conceal what Allah has created in their wombs if they believe in Allah and the Last Day. Their husbands have more right to take them back in that period if they desire reconciliation. And women are similar to those against them according to what is equitable, but men have a degree over them. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. Divorce is twice, then either keep [her] in an acceptable manner or release [her] with good treatment. And it is not lawful for you to take back anything of what you have given them unless both fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah. But if you fear that they will not be able to keep within the limits of Allah, then there is no blame upon them for what she gives herself in ransom. These are the limits of Allah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah - it is those who are the wrongdoers. But if he divorces her, then she is not lawful to him afterward until she marries a husband other than him. But if he divorces her again, there is no blame upon them if they return to each other if they think that they can keep within the limits of Allah. And these are the limits of Allah which He makes clear for a people who know.
2:231-232	And when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term, either keep them according to acceptable terms or release them according to acceptable terms. And do not keep them to cause harm in order to transgress. And whoever does that has certainly wronged himself. And do not take the verses of Allah in jest. And remember the favor of Allah upon you and what He has sent down to you of the Book and wisdom by which He instructs you. And fear Allah and know that Allah is Knowing of all things. And when you divorce women and they have fulfilled their term, do not prevent them from marrying their [former] husbands if they agree among themselves on an acceptable basis. This is instructed to whoever among you believes in Allah and the Last Day. That is purer for you and cleaner. And Allah knows, while you do not know.
2:233-233	Mothers shall breastfeed their children two complete years for him who wishes to complete the nursing. The father shall bear the cost of their food and clothing on an equitable basis. No soul shall be charged except [with that within] its capacity. Neither shall a mother be made to suffer harm on account of her child, nor a father on account of his child. And the same is incumbent upon the heir. But if they both desire weaning by mutual consent and consultation, there is no blame upon them. But if you wish to have nurses for your children, there is no blame upon you as long as you pay what you have given in an equitable manner. And fear Allah and know that Allah, of what you do, is Seeing.
2:234-237	And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they shall wait concerning themselves four months and ten days. Then when they have fulfilled their term, there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an acceptable manner. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do. And there is no blame upon you for that which you expressly propose to women or conceal within yourselves. Allah knows that you will mention them, but do not make an appointment with them in secret unless you say a proper word. And do not determine to tie the marriage knot until the prescribed term has been fulfilled. And know that Allah knows what is within your souls, so beware of Him, and know that Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing. There is no blame upon you if you divorce women before you have touched them or specified for them an obligation. And give them a provision, the wealthy according to his ability and the poor according to his ability - a provision according to what is acceptable - a duty upon those who do good. And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have specified for them an obligation, then give half of what you specified, unless they forego it or he in whose hand is the marriage contract foregoes it. And to forgive is closer to righteousness. And do not forget graciousness between you. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of what you do.
2:238-239	Guard strictly the prayers, especially the middle prayer, and stand before God, devoutly obedient. And if you fear [Allah], [then] on foot or riding. But when you are secure, then remember God as He has taught you that which you did not know.
2:240-242	And those of you who die and leave wives behind them, they shall bequeath to their wives a maintenance period of one year without turning them out. But if they go out, there is no blame upon you for what they do with themselves in an honorable manner. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. And for divorced women there is a provision according to what is acceptable - a duty upon the righteous. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may understand.
2:243-245	"Have you not considered those who went forth from their homes, by the thousands, for fear of death? But Allah said to them, ""Die."" Then He revived them. Indeed, Allah is full of bounty to the people, but most of the people do not give thanks. And fight in the cause of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearing and Knowing. Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over? And Allah withholds and grants abundance, and to Him you will be returned."
2:246-246	"Have you not considered the assembly of the Children of Israel after Moses, when they said to a prophet of theirs, ""Send us a king, and we will fight in the cause of God."" He said, ""Is it possible that if fighting is prescribed for you, you will not fight?"" They said, ""And why should we not fight in the cause of God while we have been expelled from our homes and our children?"" But when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned back, except for a few of them. And God is Knowing of the wrongdoers."
2:247-248	"And their prophet said to them, ""Indeed, Allah has sent you Saul as a king."" They said, ""How can he have kingship over us when we are more deserving of kingship than he and he has not been given abundance of wealth?"" He said, ""Indeed, Allah has chosen him over you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills, and Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing."" And their prophet said to them, ""Indeed, the sign of his kingship is that there will come to you the Ark, in which is reassurance from your Lord and a remnant of what the family of Moses and the family of Aaron left behind, carried by angels. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers."""
2:249-252	"When Saul set out with the soldiers, he said, ""Indeed, Allah will test you with a river. So whoever drinks from it is not of me, and whoever does not taste it - indeed, he is of me, except for he who scoops a handful with his hand."" So they drank from it, except for a few of them. But when he and those who believed with him had crossed it, they said, ""We have no power today against Goliath and his soldiers."" Those who thought that they would meet Allah said, ""How often has a small company overcome a large one by Allah's permission. And Allah is with the patient."" And when they came forward to face Goliath and his soldiers, they said, ""Our Lord, pour upon us patience and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people."" So they defeated them by Allah's permission, and David killed Goliath. And Allah gave him kingship and wisdom and taught him whatever he willed. And had Allah not repelled some people by means of others, the earth would have been corrupted. But Allah is full of bounty to the worlds. These are the verses of Allah which We recite to you in truth, and indeed, you are of the messengers."
2:253-254	These messengers - We preferred some of them over others. Among them were those to whom Allah spoke, and He raised some of them in degree. And We gave Jesus, the son of Mary, clear proofs and supported him with the Holy Spirit. And if Allah had willed, those after them would not have fought one another after the clear proofs had come to them, but they differed - and among them were those who believed and among them were those who disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought one another, but Allah does what He intends. O you who have believed, spend from what We have provided you before there comes a Day in which there will be no exchange or friendship or intercession. And the disbelievers - it is they who are the wrongdoers.
2:255-255	Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is before them and what is behind them, but they encompass not a thing of His knowledge save what He wills. His Kursi extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation does not tire Him. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.
2:256-256	There is no compulsion in religion. The right way has become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing.
2:257-257	God is the protector of those who believe. He brings them out from darknesses into the light. But as for those who disbelieve, their protectors are false gods. They bring them out from the light into darknesses. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.
2:258-258	Have you not considered him who argued with Abraham concerning his Lord because God had given him kingship? When Abraham said, “My Lord is He who gives life and causes death,” he said, “I give life and cause death.” Abraham said, “Then God brings the sun from the east, so bring it from the west.” So the disbeliever was confounded. And God does not guide the wrongdoing people.
2:259-259	"Or like the one who passed by a town and it was desolate upon its roofs. He said, ""How will Allah revive this after its death?"" So Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up. He said, ""How long did you remain?"" He said, ""I remained a day or part of a day."" He said, ""Rather, you have remained a hundred years. So look at your food and your drink - it has not become stale. And look at your donkey, and We will make you a sign to the people. And look at the bones - how We raise them up and then cover them with flesh."" But when it became clear to him, he said, ""I know that Allah is over all things competent."""
2:260-260	"And when Abraham said, ""My Lord, show me how You give life to the dead."" He said, ""Do you not believe?"" He said, ""Yes, but [O Muhammad], that my heart may be reassured."" He said, ""Then take four birds and bring them to you, then place a portion of them on every mountain, then call them, and they will come to you running. And know that God is Exalted in Might and Wise."""
2:261-264	The parable of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah is that of a grain [of corn]: it grows seven ears; in each ear is a hundred grains. And Allah multiplies [His favor] for whom He wills. And Allah is All-Encompassing and Knowing. Those who spend their wealth in the way of Allah and do not follow up what they have spent with [reproach] or injury will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve. A kind word and forgiveness are better than charity followed by injury. And Allah is Free of need and Forbearing. O you who have believed, do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury. Like one who spends his wealth [only] to be seen by people and does not believe in Allah and the Last Day. His example is like that of a smooth rock upon which is soil, then a downpour strikes it and leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
2:265-266	The parable of those who spend their wealth seeking the pleasure of Allah and to strengthen themselves is that of a garden on a height which is struck by heavy rain, so it produces its fruit double. But if heavy rain does not strike it, then a drizzle. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing. Would any of you like to have a garden of palm trees and grapevines, beneath which rivers flow, for him therein are all kinds of fruits, and he is afflicted with old age while he has weak offspring, and then a whirlwind with fire in it strikes it and it is burned? Thus does Allah make clear to you the verses that you may give thought.
2:267-269	O you who have believed, spend from the good things which you have earned and from that which We have produced for you from the earth. And do not aim toward the defective therefrom, spending while you would not take it [in charity] unless you close your eyes to it. And know that Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy. Satan threatens you with poverty and orders you to immorality, while Allah promises you forgiveness from Him and bounty. And Allah is All-Encompassing and Knowing. He grants wisdom to whom He wills. And whoever has been granted wisdom has certainly been granted much good. And none will remember except those of understanding.
2:270-271	Whatever you spend or vow, Allah knows it. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers. If you disclose your charitable expenditures, they are good, but if you conceal them and give them to the poor, it is better for you. And He will remove from you some of your misdeeds. And Allah, with what you do, is Acquainted.
2:272-274	It is not against you to guide them, but Allah guides whom He wills. And whatever you spend of good is for yourselves, and you do not spend except seeking the countenance of Allah. And whatever you spend of good will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged. [It is] for the poor who are restricted in the cause of Allah, unable to move about in the land. The ignorant think them rich because of their abstinence. You will know them by their mark. They do not ask people insistently. And whatever you spend of good - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it. [It is] for those who spend their wealth by night and by day, secretly and publicly - they will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve.
2:275-276	"Those who consume interest cannot stand [on the Day of Resurrection] except as one stands who is being beaten by Satan into insanity. That is because they say, ""Trade is [just] like interest."" But God has permitted trade and has forbidden interest. So whoever has received an admonition from his Lord and desists may have what is past, and his affair rests with God. But whoever returns [to it] - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. God destroys interest and gives increase for charities. And God does not like every disbelieving sinner."
2:277-281	Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds and established prayer and given zakah will have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve. O you who have believed, fear Allah and give up what remains [due to] interest, if you should be believers. But if you do not, then be informed of war from Allah and His Messenger. But if you repent, you will have your principal sums - [so] deal [not] unjustly, nor will you be dealt with unjustly. But if [the debtor] is in hardship, then postponement until [a time of] ease, but to remit [your debt] by charity is better for you, if you only knew. And fear a Day when you will be returned to Allah. Then every soul will be fully compensated for what it earned, and they will not be treated unjustly.
2:282-283	O you who believe! When you contract a debt for a specified term, write it down. And let a scribe write it down between you in justice. And let not the scribe refuse to write as Allah has taught him. So let him write, and let the one upon whom the debt is owed dictate. And let him fear Allah, his Lord, and not withhold from it anything. But if the one upon whom the debt is owed is foolish or weak or cannot dictate himself, then let his heir dictate in justice. And bring to witness two witnesses from among your men. But if there are not two men, then a man and two women from among those whom you accept as witnesses - so that if one of the two errs, the other can remind her. And let not the witnesses refuse when they are called upon. And do not be weary of writing it down, whether it is small or large, for its term. That is more just in the sight of Allah and more suitable for testimony and more likely to prevent you from doubting. Unless it is a present trade which you carry on among yourselves, then there is no blame upon you if you do not write it down. And bring to witness when you transact, and let not the scribe or the witness be harmed. But if you do, then indeed, it is an act of disobedience on your part. And fear Allah, and Allah teaches you. And Allah is Knowing of all things. And if you are on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge taken in possession. But if one of you entrusts another, then let him who is entrusted discharge his trust. And let him fear God, his Lord. And do not conceal testimony. And whoever conceals it - indeed, his heart is sinful. And God is Knowing of what you do.
2:284-286	"To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And if you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will bring you to account for it. Then He will forgive whom He wills and punish whom He wills. And Allah is over all things competent. The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and [so have] the believers. All of them have believed in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers. ""We make no distinction between any of His messengers,"" and they say, ""We hear and we obey. [We seek] Your forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the final destination."" Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. It will have whatever it has earned, and it will bear whatever it has earned. Our Lord, do not impose blame upon us if we have forgotten or erred. Our Lord, and lay not upon us a burden like that which You laid upon those before us. Our Lord, and burden us not with that which we have no ability to bear. And pardon us; forgive us; and have mercy upon us. You are our Protector, so give us victory over the disbelieving people."
3:1-7	"Alif, Laam, Meem. Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of [all] existence. He has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what was before it. And He sent down the Torah and the Gospel before as guidance for the people, and He sent down the Criterion. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah will have a severe punishment, and Allah is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution. Indeed, nothing on earth or in heaven is hidden from Allah. It is He who shapes you in the wombs however He wills. There is no deity except Him, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. It is He who has sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book. In it are verses that are precise - they are the foundations of the Book - and others that are unspecific. As for those in whose hearts is deviation, they follow that of it that is unspecific, seeking discord and seeking an interpretation of it. And none knows its interpretation except Allah. And those firmly rooted in knowledge say, ""We believe in it. All is from our Lord."" And none will remember except those of understanding."
3:8-9	Our Lord, let not our hearts deviate after You have guided us and grant us from Yourself mercy. Indeed, You are the Bestower. Our Lord, indeed You will gather the people for a Day about which there is no doubt. Indeed, Allah does not fail in His promise.
3:10-13	"Indeed, those who disbelieve - neither their wealth nor their children will avail them at all against Allah. And those are the fuel of the Fire. [Likewise] was the way of the people of Pharaoh and those before them. They denied Our signs, so Allah seized them for their sins, and Allah is severe in penalty. Say to those who disbelieve, ""You will surely be overcome and gathered together to Hell, and wretched is the resting place."" There was already a sign for you in the two companies that met - one fighting in the cause of Allah and the other disbelieving. They saw them twice their number with their own eyes. And Allah supports with His victory whom He wills. Indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision."
3:14-17	"Adorned for people is the love of desires - of women and children and heaped-up sums of gold and silver and branded horses and livestock and tilth. That is the enjoyment of worldly life, and Allah has with Him the best return. Say, ""Shall I inform you of [something] better than that?"" For those who fear Allah are gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and purified spouses and approval from Allah. And Allah is Seeing of His servants. Those who say, ""Our Lord, indeed we have believed, so forgive us our sins and protect us from the punishment of the Fire."" [These are] the patient, the truthful, the obedient, the spenders, and those who seek forgiveness in the hours before dawn."
3:18-20	"Allah bears witness that there is no god except Him, and [so do] the angels and those of knowledge - maintaining justice. There is no god except Him - the Exalted in Might, the Wise. Indeed, the religion in the sight of Allah is Islam. And those who were given the Scripture did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And whoever disbelieves in the verses of Allah - then indeed, Allah is swift in account. So if they argue with you, say, ""I have submitted myself [to Allah], and so have those who follow me."" And say to those who were given the Scripture and to the unlearned, ""Have you submitted [to Allah]?"" And if they have submitted, then they are [rightly] guided. But if they turn away - then upon you is only the conveyance [of the message]. And Allah is Seeing of His servants."
3:21-22	Indeed, those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah and kill the prophets without right and kill those who enjoin justice among the people - give them tidings of a painful punishment. Those are the ones whose deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers.
3:23-25	"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They are invited to the Book of Allah to judge between them; then a party of them turns away while they are averse. That is because they say, ""The Fire will not touch us except for a few days."" And what they used to invent deceived them in their religion. But how will it be when We assemble them for a Day about which there is no doubt and every soul is fully compensated for what it earned, and they will not be wronged?"
3:26-27	Say: O God, Owner of the Kingdom, You give the kingdom to whom You will and You take the kingdom away from whom You will. You exalt whom You will and You abase whom You will. In Your hand is all good. Indeed, You are over all things competent. You merge the night into the day and merge the day into the night. You bring the living out of the dead and bring the dead out of the living. And You provide for whom You will without account.
3:28-30	"Let not believers take disbelievers as allies rather than believers. And whoever does that has nothing to do with Allah, unless you fear them out of fear. And Allah warns you of Himself, and to Allah is the final destination. Say, ""Whether you conceal what is in your hearts or reveal it, Allah knows it. And He knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And Allah is over all things competent."" The Day every soul will find present whatever it has done of good and whatever it has done of evil, and it will wish that between it and that was a great distance. And Allah warns you of Himself, and Allah is Kind to His servants."
3:31-32	"Say, ""If you love Allah, then follow me, and Allah will love you and forgive you your sins. Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" Say, ""Obey Allah and the Messenger."" But if they turn away, then indeed, Allah does not love the disbelievers."
3:33-41	"Indeed, Allah chose Adam, Noah, the family of Abraham, and the family of Imran above the worlds. Offspring, some from others, and Allah is Hearing and Knowing. When the wife of Imran said, ""My Lord, indeed I have vowed to You what is in my womb to be dedicated [to Your service], so accept this from me. Indeed, You are the Hearing, the Knowing."" But when she delivered her, she said, ""My Lord, indeed I have delivered a female, and Allah is most knowing of what she delivered. And the male is not like the female. And I have named her Mary, and I seek refuge for her and her offspring in You from Satan, the accursed."" So her Lord accepted her with gracious acceptance and caused her to grow in a good manner and put her under the care of Zachariah. Every time Zachariah entered upon her in the sanctuary, he found with her provision. He said, ""O Mary, from where did you get this?"" She said, ""It is from Allah. Indeed, Allah provides for whom He wills without account."" At that point, Zachariah called upon his Lord. He said, ""My Lord, grant me from Yourself good offspring. Indeed, You are the Hearer of supplication."" So the angels called to him while he was standing in prayer in the sanctuary, ""Allah gives you good tidings of John, confirming a word from Allah and [who will be] noble, chaste, and a prophet from among the righteous."" He said, ""My Lord, how will I have a boy when I have reached old age and my wife is barren?"" He said, ""Thus does God do what He wills."" He said, ""My Lord, appoint for me a sign."" He said, ""Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three days except by gesture. And remember your Lord often and glorify Him in the evening and the morning."""
3:42-44	"And [mention] when the angels said, ""O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the worlds. O Mary, be devoutly obedient to your Lord and prostrate and bow with those who bow. That is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad]. And you were not with them when they cast their pens as to which of them should be responsible for Mary. Nor were you with them when they disputed."""
3:45-51	"When the angels said, ""O Mary, indeed Allah gives you good tidings of a Word from Him, whose name will be the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary - distinguished in this world and the Hereafter and among those brought near [to Allah]. He will speak to the people in the cradle and in maturity and will be among the righteous."" She said, ""My Lord, how will I have a son while no man has touched me?"" He said, ""Thus does Allah create what He wills. When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, ""Be,"" and it is. And He taught him the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel. And [also] a messenger to the Children of Israel. [He said], ""Indeed, I have come to you with a sign from your Lord in that I design for you from clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, then I breathe into it and it becomes a bird by Allah's permission. And I heal the blind and the leper and bring the dead to life by Allah's permission. And I inform you of what you eat and what you store in your houses. Indeed in that is a sign for you, if you are believers. And confirming what came before me of the Torah and to make lawful for you some of what was forbidden to you. And I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear Allah and obey me. Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path."""
3:52-53	"And when Jesus perceived disbelief on their part, he said, ""Who will be my helpers for the cause of Allah?"" The disciples said, ""We are helpers of Allah. We have believed in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims [in submission]. Our Lord, we have believed in what You revealed and have followed the Messenger, so register us among the witnesses."""
3:54-58	And they planned, and Allah planned, and Allah is the best of planners. When Allah said, “O Jesus, indeed I will take you and raise you to Myself and purify you from those who disbelieve and make those who follow you superior to those who disbelieve until the Day of Resurrection. Then to Me is your return, and I will judge between you concerning that over which you used to differ. As for those who disbelieve, I will punish them with a severe punishment in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have no helpers. As for those who believe and do righteous deeds, He will pay them their reward in full, and Allah does not like the wrongdoers. That We recite to you of the verses and the wise remembrance.
3:59-61	Indeed, the example of Jesus before God is as that of Adam. He created Him from dust and then said to him, “Be,” and he was. The truth is from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters. But whoever disputes with you concerning him after what has come to you of knowledge, say, “Come, let us call our sons and your sons, our women and your women, ourselves and yourselves, then supplicate earnestly and invoke the curse of God upon the liars.”
3:62-68	"Indeed, this is the true story. And there is no god except Allah, and indeed, Allah is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. But if they turn away - then indeed, Allah is Knowing of the corrupters. Say, ""O People of the Scripture, come to a word that is equitable between us and you - that we will not worship except Allah and not associate anything with Him and not take one another as lords instead of Allah."" But if they turn away, then say, ""Bear witness that we are Muslims [in submission]."" O People of the Scripture, why do you argue about Abraham, while the Torah and the Gospel were not revealed until after him? Then will you not reason? Here you are! You have argued about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you argue about that of which you have no knowledge? And Allah knows, while you do not know. Abraham was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was one inclining toward truth, a Muslim [submitting to Allah]. And he was not of the polytheists. Indeed, the people most worthy of Abraham are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe. And Allah is the ally of the believers."
3:69-74	"A faction of the People of the Scripture wish they could mislead you, but they mislead only themselves, and they perceive [it] not. O People of the Scripture, why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah while you are witnessing? O People of the Scripture, why do you mix truth with falsehood and conceal the truth while you know? And a faction of the People of the Scripture say, ""Believe in that which has been revealed to those who believe at the beginning of the day and disbelieve at its end that perhaps they will return."" And do not believe except for one who follows your religion. Say, ""Indeed, the guidance is the guidance of Allah - that anyone should be given the like of what you have been given or that they should dispute with you before your Lord."" Say, ""Indeed, bounty is in Allah's hand. He bestows it on whom He wills. And Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing. He chooses for His mercy whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty."""
3:75-77	"And among the People of the Scripture is he who, if you entrust him with a great amount, he will return it to you. And among them is he who, if you entrust him with a dinar, he will not return it to you unless you stand over him. That is because they say, ""We have no responsibility for the unlettered ones."" And they tell a lie about Allah while they know. But whoever fulfills his covenant and fears Allah - then indeed, Allah loves the righteous. Indeed, those who exchange the covenant of Allah and their oaths for a small price - those will have no portion in the Hereafter, and Allah will not speak to them or look at them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He purify them. And theirs is a painful punishment."
3:78-80	And indeed, among them is a party who distort the Scripture with their tongues so that you may think it is from the Scripture, but it is not from the Scripture. And they say, “It is from God,” but it is not from God. And they tell a lie about God while they know. It is not for a human being that God should give him the Scripture and wisdom and prophethood and then he should say to the people, “Be servants to me instead of God.” But “Be devout scholars of the Lord because you have taught the Scripture and because you have studied it.” And he does not command you to take the angels and the prophets as lords. Would he command you to disbelieve after you have been Muslims?
3:81-83	And [mention] when Allah took a covenant from the prophets, “Whatever I give you of the Book and wisdom and then there comes to you a messenger confirming what is with you, you must believe in him and support him.” He said, “Have you acknowledged and taken upon yourself My commitment?” They said, “We acknowledge.” He said, “Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses.” But whoever turns away after that - then those are the defiantly disobedient. Is it then that they seek other than the religion of Allah while to Him have submitted [all] those within the heavens and earth, willingly or by compulsion, and to Him they will be returned?
3:84-85	"Say, ""We believe in God and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and in what was given to Moses, Jesus, and the prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him. And whoever desires other than Islam as religion - never will it be accepted from him, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers."""
3:86-91	How can Allah guide a people who disbelieved after their belief and had testified that the Messenger was true and clear proofs had come to them? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. For those - their recompense is that upon them is the curse of Allah and of the angels and of the people, all together. They will abide therein. The punishment will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved. Except for those who repent after that and reform - then, indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Indeed, those who disbelieve after their belief and then increase in disbelief - never will their repentance be accepted, and it is those who are the ones who are astray. Indeed, those who disbelieve and die while they are disbelievers - never will the earth full of gold be accepted from one of them, even if he were to ransom himself with it. For those is a painful punishment, and they will have no helpers.
3:92-94	"You will not attain righteousness until you spend out of that which you love. And whatever you spend - indeed, Allah is Knowing of it. All food was lawful to the Children of Israel except what Israel had forbidden to himself before the Torah was revealed. Say, ""Then bring the Torah and recite it, if you should be truthful."" But whoever invents a lie against Allah after that - it is those who are the wrongdoers."
3:95-97	"Say, ""Allah has spoken the truth, so follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah. Indeed, the first House [of worship] established for mankind was that at Bakkah - blessed and a guidance for the worlds. In it are clear signs [such as] the standing place of Abraham. And whoever enters it shall be safe. And Hajj to the House is a duty that mankind owes to Allah - those who can afford the expenses [for the journey] to it. And whoever disbelieves - then indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds."""
3:98-101	"Say, ""O People of the Scripture, why do you disbelieve in the verses of Allah while Allah is Witness over what you do?"" Say, ""O People of the Scripture, why do you avert from the way of Allah those who have believed, seeking to make it crooked while you are witnesses? And Allah is not unaware of what you do?"" O you who have believed, if you obey a party of those who were given the Scripture, they would turn you back after your belief to disbelief. And how can you disbelieve while the verses of Allah are recited to you and among you is His Messenger? And whoever holds fast to Allah has certainly been guided to a straight path."
3:102-109	"O you who have believed, fear Allah as He should be feared and do not die except as Muslims. And hold fast, all together, to the rope of Allah, and be not divided. And remember Allah's favor upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together so that you became, by His favor, brethren - and you were on the brink of a pit of Fire, and He saved you from it. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided. And let there arise out of you a community inviting to good, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong. And those will be the successful. And do not be like those who became divided and differed after clear proofs had come to them. And those will have a great punishment. The Day when some faces will turn white and some faces will turn black. As for those whose faces will turn black - [it will be said], ""Did you disbelieve after your belief? Then taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve."" And as for those whose faces will turn white - they will be in the mercy of Allah; they will abide therein eternally. These are the verses of Allah We recite to you in truth. And Allah does not intend injustice to the worlds. And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and to Allah are matters returned."
3:110-115	You are the best nation produced for mankind. You enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah. And if the People of the Scripture had believed, it would have been better for them. Among them are believers, but most of them are defiantly disobedient. They will not harm you except with a slight annoyance. And if they fight you, they will show you their backs; then they will not be aided. Abasement has been imposed upon them wherever they are overtaken, except by a rope from Allah and a rope from the people. And they incurred wrath from Allah, and poverty has been imposed upon them. That is because they disbelieved in the verses of Allah and killed the prophets without right. That is because they disobeyed and were transgressors. They are not all alike. Among the People of the Scripture is a community standing [in prayer], reciting the verses of Allah during periods of the night and prostrating. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, enjoining what is right and forbidding what is wrong, and hastening to good deeds. And those are among the righteous. And whatever good they do - never will it be denied them. And Allah is Knowing of the righteous.
3:116-117	Indeed, those who disbelieve - never will their wealth or their children avail them at all against Allah. And those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. The parable of what they spend in this worldly life is that of a wind in which is a cold wind which strikes the crops of a people who wronged themselves and destroys them. It is not Allah who wrongs them, but it is themselves that they wrong.
3:118-120	O you who have believed, do not take as intimates those other than yourselves, for they will spare no ruin for you. They wish you would suffer. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, and what their breasts conceal is greater. We have certainly made clear to you the verses, if you should use reason. Here you are: you love them, but they do not love you, and you believe in the Book, all of it. And when they meet you, they say, “We believe,” but when they are alone, they bite their fingertips at you out of rage. Say, “Die in your rage. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts.” If good touches you, it distresses them, but if evil befalls you, they rejoice in it. But if you are patient and fear Allah, not will their plot harm you at all. Indeed, Allah is encompassing of what they do.
3:121-129	"And when you left your family to station the believers in their stations for battle, and Allah is Hearing and Knowing. When two parties among you were about to lose heart, and Allah was their Protector, and in Allah let the believers put their trust. And Allah had already given you victory at Badr when you were weak, so fear Allah that you may be grateful. When you said to the believers, ""Is it not sufficient for you that your Lord should reinforce you with three thousand angels sent down?"" But yes, if you are patient and fear Allah and they come upon you at once, your Lord will reinforce you with five thousand angels marked with marks. And Allah did not make it except as good tidings for you and that your hearts might be reassured thereby. And victory is not except from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. That He may cut off a portion of those who disbelieve or subdue them so they return disappointed. You have no part in the matter, whether He turns to them in mercy or punishes them, for they are wrongdoers. And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills, and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
3:130-132	O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, and fear Allah that you may be successful. And fear the Fire, which has been prepared for the disbelievers. And obey Allah and the Messenger that you may receive mercy.
3:133-136	And hasten to forgiveness from your Lord and a Paradise as wide as the heavens and earth, prepared for the righteous. Those who spend [in charity] during ease and hardship and who restrain anger and pardon the people - and Allah loves the doers of good. And those who, when they have committed an immorality or wronged themselves, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins - and who can forgive sins except Allah - and do not persist in what they have done while they know. For those, their reward is forgiveness from their Lord and gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. And excellent is the reward of the workers.
3:137-144	Indeed, there have been examples before you, so travel through the land and see what was the end of those who denied. This is a clear statement for the people and guidance and instruction for the righteous. And do not weaken and do not grieve, and you will be superior if you are [true] believers. If a wound should touch you, a wound similar to it has already touched the [righteous] people. And these days We alternate among the people that Allah may make evident those who believe and take from among you martyrs - and Allah does not like wrongdoers - and that Allah may purify those who believe and destroy the disbelievers. Or do you think that you will enter Paradise while Allah has not yet made evident those among you who strive hard and made evident the steadfast? And you used to wish for death before you met it. But now you have seen it while you were looking on. And Muhammad is no more than a messenger; [other] messengers have passed away before him. So if he dies or is killed, will you turn back on your heels? And whoever turns back on his heels will not harm Allah at all. And Allah will reward the grateful.
3:145-148	"No soul can die except by Allah's permission at a predetermined time. And whoever desires the reward of this world, We will give him thereof; and whoever desires the reward of the Hereafter, We will give him thereof. And We will reward the grateful. And how many a prophet fought with whom were many pious men. But they did not lose heart for what afflicted them in the cause of Allah, nor did they weaken, nor did they humble themselves. And Allah loves the patient. And their only saying was that they said, ""Our Lord, forgive us our sins and our transgression in our conduct and plant firmly our feet and give us victory over the disbelieving people."" So Allah gave them the reward of this world and the best reward of the Hereafter. And Allah loves the doers of good."
3:149-151	O you who have believed, if you obey those who disbelieve, they will turn you back on your heels, and you will become losers. Rather, Allah is your Protector, and He is the best of helpers. We will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve because they have associated with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority. And their refuge is the Fire, and wretched is the residence of the wrongdoers.
3:152-155	"And Allah had already fulfilled His promise to you when you were killing them by His permission until, when you lost heart and disputed about the matter and disobeyed after He had shown you what you love - among you were those who desired this world and among you were those who desired the Hereafter. Then He turned you away from them that He might test you. And He has certainly pardoned you, and Allah is full of bounty to the believers. When you were ascending and not turning back to anyone while the Messenger was calling you to your rear, He rewarded you with grief for grief - that you might not grieve for what escaped you or for what befell you. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do. Then He sent down upon you, after the grief, security - a drowsiness that overcame a party of you and another party who were concerned about themselves, assuming about Allah other than the truth - the assumption of the times of ignorance. They said, ""Do we have any part in the matter?"" Say, ""Indeed, the matter is Allah's."" They conceal within themselves that which they do not reveal to you. They say, ""If we had any part in the matter, we would not have been killed here."" Say, ""If you had been in your houses, those for whom killing was decreed would have come forth to their beds so that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purify what is in your hearts."" And Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts. Those of you who turned back on the day the two armies met - it was Satan who caused them to slip because of some of what they had earned. But God has pardoned them. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Forbearing."
3:156-158	"O you who have believed, do not be like those who disbelieved and said about their brothers when they traveled throughout the land or were engaged in war, ""If they had been with us, they would not have died, nor were they killed,"" [so that] Allah may make that a regret within their hearts. And Allah gives life and causes death, and Allah, of what you do, is Seeing. And if you are killed in the way of Allah or die - forgiveness from Allah and mercy are better than what they accumulate. And if you die or are killed - to Allah you will be gathered."
3:159-160	So it is part of mercy from Allah that you are lenient with them. Had you been rude [in speech] and harsh in heart, they would have disbanded from about you. So pardon them and ask forgiveness for them and consult them in the matter. And when you have decided, then rely upon Allah. Indeed, Allah loves those who rely [upon Him]. If Allah helps you, none can overcome you; but if He forsakes you, who is there that can help you after Him? And upon Allah let the believers rely.
3:161-163	It is not for a prophet to take spoils of war. And whoever takes spoils of war will bring what he took on the Day of Resurrection. Then every soul will be fully compensated for what it earned, and they will not be treated unjustly. Is he who pursues the pleasure of Allah like he who draws down upon himself the wrath of Allah? His refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination? They are of degrees of status with Allah, and Allah is Seeing of what they do.
3:164-165	"Allah has conferred a great favor upon the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom - although they were before in clear error. And when a disaster struck you - although you had struck twice as much - you said, ""From where is this?"" Say, ""It is from yourselves."" Indeed, Allah is over all things competent."
3:166-168	"And whatever befell you on the day the two armies met was by permission of Allah, and that He might make evident those who were hypocrites and were told, ""Come, fight in the cause of Allah or defend yourselves."" They said, ""If we had known [about] fighting, we would have followed you."" They were nearer to disbelief that day than to faith. They say with their mouths what is not in their hearts. And Allah is most knowing of what they conceal. Those who said to their brothers while they sat back, ""If they had obeyed us, they would not have been killed."" Say, ""Then avert death from yourselves, if you should be truthful."""
3:169-175	"And never think that those who are killed in the way of Allah are dead. Rather, they are alive with their Lord, and they are provided for. Rejoicing in what Allah has given them of His bounty and receiving good tidings for those who have not yet joined them from behind them that there is no fear for them, nor will they grieve. Rejoicing in favor from Allah and bounty and that Allah does not allow the reward of the believers to be lost. Those who responded to Allah and the Messenger after the wound had afflicted them - for those among them who did good and feared Allah is a great reward. Those to whom the people said, ""Indeed, the people have gathered against you, so fear them,"" but it only increased them in faith, and they said, ""Sufficient for us is Allah, and [He is] the best Disposer of affairs."" So they returned with favor from Allah and bounty. No harm had touched them, and they pursued the approval of Allah. And Allah is the possessor of great bounty. That is only Satan frightening his allies, so fear them not but fear Me, if you are believers."
3:176-180	And let not those who hasten into disbelief grieve you. Indeed, they will never harm Allah at all. Allah intends not to grant them any share in the Hereafter, and they will have a great punishment. Indeed, those who purchase disbelief in exchange for faith will never harm Allah at all, and they will have a painful punishment. And let not those who disbelieve think that Our granting them respite is better for themselves. We only grant them respite so that they may increase in sin, and they will have a humiliating punishment. It is not for Allah to leave the believers in that state you are in until He distinguishes the wicked from the good. And it is not for Allah to inform you of the unseen, but Allah chooses from among His messengers whom He wills. So believe in Allah and His messengers. And if you believe and fear Allah, then for you is a great reward. And let not those who withhold what Allah has given them of His bounty think that it is good for them. Rather, it is bad for them. They will be surrounded by what they withheld on the Day of Resurrection. And to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth, and Allah, with what you do, is Acquainted.
3:181-184	"Allah has heard the statement of those who said, ""Allah is poor, and we are rich."" We will record what they said and their killing of the prophets without right, and We will say, ""Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire."" That is for what your hands have put forth, and because Allah is not unjust to His servants. Those who said, ""Allah has enjoined upon us that we should not believe in a messenger until he brings us an offering consumed by fire."" Say, ""There have come to you messengers before me with clear proofs and with what you have said. So why did you kill them, if you should be truthful?"" But if they deny you, then messengers before you were denied who came with clear proofs and scriptures and the enlightening Book."
3:185-186	Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your full compensation on the Day of Resurrection. So he who is drawn away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise has attained [his desire]. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion. You will surely be tested in your possessions and your lives, and you will hear from those who were given the Scripture before you and from those who associate others with God much abuse. But if you are patient and fear God - indeed, that is of the matters [worthy] of determination.
3:187-189	"And [mention] when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Scripture, ""Make it clear to the people and do not conceal it."" But they threw it behind their backs and exchanged for it a small price. How evil is that which they exchange. Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done - do not think that they are beyond the reach of punishment. And they will have a painful punishment. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is over all things competent."
3:190-195	Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the alternation of the night and the day are signs for those of understanding. [They say], “Our Lord, You have not created this in vain; glory be to You! Protect us from the punishment of the Fire.” [They say,] “Our Lord, indeed he whom You admit to the Fire - You have disgraced him, and for the wrongdoers there are no helpers.” [They say,] “Our Lord, indeed we have heard a caller calling to faith, ‘Believe in your Lord,’ and we have believed. Our Lord, so forgive us our sins and remove from us our misdeeds and take us in death with the righteous. Our Lord, and give us what You promised us through Your messengers and do not disgrace us on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, You do not fail in Your promise.” So their Lord responded to them, “Never will I allow to be lost the work of a worker among you, whether male or female. You are of one another. So those who emigrated and were expelled from their homes and were harmed in My cause and fought and were killed - I will surely remove from them their misdeeds and admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow - a reward from Allah. And Allah has with Him the best reward.”
3:196-198	Let not the free movement of those who disbelieve throughout the land deceive you. [It is] a brief enjoyment; then their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place. But those who feared their Lord will have gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, as provision from God. And what is with God is best for the righteous.
3:199-200	And indeed, among the People of the Scripture are those who believe in Allah and in what was revealed to you and what was revealed to them, humbly submissive to Allah. They do not exchange the verses of Allah for a small price. Those will have their reward with their Lord. Indeed, Allah is swift in account. O you who have believed, be patient and endure and remain stationed and fear Allah that you may be successful.
4:1-1	O mankind, fear your Lord, who created you from one soul and created from it its mate and dispersed from both of them many men and women. And fear God, through whom you ask one another, and the wombs. Indeed, God is ever, over you, an Observer.
4:2-6	And give orphans their property and do not exchange the bad for the good, and do not consume their property into your own property; indeed, that is a great sin. And if you fear that you will not deal justly with orphan girls, then marry women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you will not be just, then only one or those your right hands possess. That is more suitable that you will not incur injustice. And give women their dowries as a free gift; but if they give up willingly to you any part of it, then take it in enjoyment and right. And do not give the foolish your property which Allah has made a means of support for you. But provide for them from it and clothe them and speak to them words of appropriate kindness. And test orphans until they reach the age of marriage; then if you perceive in them sound judgment, release their property to them. And do not consume it extravagantly or hastily, lest they grow up. And whoever is rich, let him abstain; and whoever is poor, let him eat in reasonable measure. And when you release their property to them, bring witnesses over them, and sufficient is Allah as Accountant.
4:7-10	For men is a share of what parents and near relatives leave, and for women is a share of what parents and near relatives leave, be it little or much - an obligatory share. And when relatives, orphans, and the needy are present at the division, provide for them from it and speak to them words of appropriate kindness. And let those fear who, if they left behind them weak offspring, would fear for them. So let them fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice. Indeed, those who consume the property of orphans unjustly are only consuming fire into their bellies, and they will burn in a Blaze.
4:11-12	Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. If there are women, more than two, they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves. If there is only one, she shall have half. And for his parents, to each one of them shall be a sixth of what he leaves if he has a child. But if he has no child and his parents inherit him, then his mother shall have a third. But if he has brothers, then his mother shall have a sixth after any bequest he may have made or any debt owed by your fathers and your sons - you know not which of them is nearer to you in benefit. An ordinance from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Wise. And for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child. But if they have a child, then for you is a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may have made or any debt. And for them is a fourth of what you leave if you have no child. But if you have a child, then for them is an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may have made or any debt. And if a man leaves no descendants, whether male or female, and has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. But if there are more than that, then they are partners in a third after any bequest he may have made or any debt that is not harmful. An ordinance from Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Forbearing.
4:12-14	And for you is half of what your wives leave if they have no child. But if they have a child, then for you is a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may have bequeathed or debt. And for them is a fourth of what you leave if you have no child. But if you have a child, then for them is an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may have bequeathed or debt. And if a man or a woman leaves no descendants but has a brother or a sister, then for each one of them is a sixth. But if there are more than that, then they share in a third after any bequest they may have bequeathed or debt, not to the detriment of others. A bequest from Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Forbearing. These are the limits set by Allah. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger - He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein. That will be the great attainment. But whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger and transgresses His limits - He will put him into a Fire to abide therein, and he will have a humiliating punishment.
4:15-16	And those of your women who commit lewdness, bring against them four witnesses from among you. And if they testify, confine them to houses until death takes them or Allah ordains for them a way out. And those of you who commit it, punish them both. But if they repent and amend, then leave them alone. Indeed, Allah is ever Accepting of repentance and Merciful.
4:17-18	Repentance is only for those who do evil in ignorance and then repent soon after. It is those to whom Allah will turn in forgiveness. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. But repentance is not for those who do evil deeds until, when death approaches one of them, he says, “Indeed, I repent now,” nor for those who die while they are disbelievers. For them We have prepared a painful punishment.
4:19-21	O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. Nor prevent them in order to take away part of what you have given them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good. And if you desire to replace one wife with another and you have given one of them a great amount [of wealth], do not take back from it anything. Would you take it back by slander and manifest sin? And how could you take it while you have gone in unto one another and they have taken from you a solemn covenant?
4:22-24	And do not marry those women whom your fathers married, except what has already occurred. Indeed, it was immorality and hateful and an evil way. Forbidden to you are your mothers, your daughters, your sisters, your paternal aunts, your maternal aunts, your brother's daughters, your sister's daughters, your mothers who have suckled you, your foster sisters, the mothers of your wives, your stepdaughters under your guardianship born of your women to whom you have gone in - but if you have not gone in to them, there is no blame upon you - [so do] the wives of your sons who are from your loins, and [for marrying] two sisters together, except for what has already occurred. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And chaste women, except those your right hands possess - this is Allah's decree upon you. And lawful to you are all beyond that - that you seek [marriage] with your wealth, in chastity, not in unlawful sexual intercourse. So whatever of them you have enjoyed, give them their due compensation as an obligation. And there is no blame upon you for what you mutually agree upon after the obligation. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise.
4:25-25	And whoever among you cannot afford to marry free, believing women, then from those whom your right hands possess of your believing slave girls. And Allah knows best about your faith, you are one from another. So marry them with the permission of their people and give them their dowries according to what is acceptable - chaste, not fornicators nor taking paramours. But when they have become chaste, then if they commit an immorality, then upon them is half of that upon the free women of the punishment. That is for him among you who fears hardship. But to be patient is better for you. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
4:26-28	Allah desires to make clear to you and guide you to the ways of those before you and to turn to you in forgiveness. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. And Allah desires to turn to you in forgiveness. And those who follow their lusts desire that you should deviate with a great deviation. Allah desires to lighten your burden, for man was created weak.
4:29-30	O you who have believed, do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only [in lawful] business by mutual consent. And do not kill yourselves. Indeed, Allah is to you ever Merciful. And whoever does that in aggression and injustice - We will drive him into a Fire. And that, for Allah, is easy.
4:31-31	If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden, We will remove from you your lesser sins and admit you to a noble entrance.
4:32-33	And do not wish for that by which Allah has given some of you more than others. Men shall have a share of what they have earned, and women shall have a share of what they have earned. And ask Allah of His bounty. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing of all things. And for everyone We have appointed heirs of that which parents and near relatives leave. And those with whom you have made a covenant, so give them their share. Indeed, Allah is, over all things, Witness.
4:34-35	Men are the maintainers of women, because Allah has given one more (strength) than the other, and because they spend (for maintenance) from their means. So the righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband's] absence what Allah would have them guard. But as for those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them and forsake them in the beds and strike them. But if they obey you, seek not against them a way. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand. And if you fear a breach between the two, appoint an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people. If they both desire reconciliation, Allah will cause it between them. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Acquainted.
4:36-40	And worship Allah and associate nothing with Him, and to parents do good, and to relatives, orphans, the needy, the neighbor who is a relative and the neighbor who is a stranger, the companion at your side, the traveler, and those whom your right hands possess. Indeed, Allah does not like anyone who is arrogant and boastful. Those who are stingy and enjoin stinginess on people and conceal what Allah has given them of His bounty - and We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. And those who spend their wealth [only] to be seen by people and do not believe in Allah or the Last Day. And he to whom Satan is a companion - then evil is he [as] a companion. And what would they have suffered if they had believed in Allah and the Last Day and spent from what Allah has provided for them? And Allah is Knowing of them. Indeed, Allah does not wrong by as much as an atom's weight. And if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.
4:41-42	How [will it be] when We bring from every nation a witness and We bring you, [O Muhammad], as a witness over these? That Day those who disbelieved and disobeyed the Messenger will wish that the earth were leveled with them, and they will not conceal from Allah a word.
4:43-43	O you who have believed, do not approach prayer while you are intoxicated until you know what you are saying or in a state of janabah, except those passing through, until you have bathed. And if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the relieving himself or you have contacted women and do not find water, then seek clean earth and wipe over your faces and your hands. Indeed, Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving.
4:44-46	"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They purchase error and wish you to go astray from the way. And Allah is most knowing of your enemies. And sufficient is Allah as an ally, and sufficient is Allah as a helper. Among those who are Jews are those who distort words from their [proper] usages and say, ""We hear and disobey"" and ""Hear, but do not hear"" and ""Pay attention to us,"" twisting their tongues and attacking the religion. And if only they had said, ""We hear and obey"" and ""Hear and unzurna,"" it would have been better for them and more upright. But Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe, except for a few."
4:47-48	O you who have been given the Scripture, believe in what We have revealed confirming that which is with you, before We obliterate faces and turn them backwards or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers. And the command of Allah is ever accomplished. Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whom He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah has certainly fabricated a tremendous sin.
4:49-50	Have you not considered those who claim themselves to be pure? Rather, it is Allah who purifies whom He wills, and they are not wronged a thread. See how they invent falsehood against Allah, and sufficient is that as a manifest sin.
4:51-55	"Have you not seen those who were given a portion of the Scripture? They believe in jibt and taghut and say of those who disbelieve, ""These are better guided than those who believe in the way."" Those are the ones cursed by Allah. And he whom Allah curses - you will never find for him a helper. Or do they have a portion of the kingdom? Then they would not give the people so much as a speck on a date stone. Or do they envy the people for what Allah has given them of His bounty? But We had given the family of Abraham the Scripture and wisdom and conferred upon them a great kingdom. But among them were those who believed in it, and among them were those who turned away from it. And sufficient is Hell as a Blaze."
4:56-57	Indeed, those who disbelieve in Our verses - We will drive them into a Fire. Every time their skins are roasted through, We will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. They will have therein purified spouses, and We will admit them to deep shade.
4:58-59	Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to those to whom they are due, and when you judge between people, to judge with justice. Indeed, Allah instructs you well. Indeed, Allah is ever Hearing and Seeing. O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you. And if you disagree over anything, refer it to Allah and the Messenger, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. That is the best and most suitable outcome.
4:60-63	"Have you not seen those who claim that they have believed in what was revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you? They wish to refer judgment to false deities, although they have been commanded to disbelieve in them. Satan wishes to lead them far astray. And when it is said to them, ""Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger,"" you see the hypocrites turning away from you in aversion. So how will it be when a disaster befalls them for what their hands have put forth and then they come to you swearing by Allah, ""We intended nothing but good and reconciliation."" Those are the ones whose hearts Allah knows, so turn away from them and admonish them and speak to them a far-reaching word about themselves."
4:64-65	And We did not send any messenger except to be obeyed by Allah's permission. And if they, when they wronged themselves, had come to you, [O Muhammad], and asked forgiveness of Allah and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them, they would have found Allah Forgiving and Merciful. But no, by your Lord, they will not [truly] believe until they make you, [O Muhammad], judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in [full, willing] submission.
4:66-70	"And if We had prescribed for them, ""Kill yourselves"" or ""Leave your homes,"" they would not have done it, except for a few of them. And if they had done what they were instructed to do, it would have been better for them and a firmer position. And then We would have given them from Ourselves a great reward. And We would have guided them to a straight path. And whoever obeys Allah and the Messenger - those will be with the ones upon whom Allah has bestowed favor of the prophets, the steadfast affirmers of truth, the martyrs and the righteous. And excellent are those as companions. That is the bounty from Allah, and sufficient is Allah as Knower."
4:71-73	O you who have believed, take your precautions and either go forth in companies or go forth all together. And indeed, among you is he who tarries [to defend himself]. If disaster strikes you, he says, “Indeed, Allah has bestowed favor upon me in that I was not present with them.” But if bounty from Allah comes to you, he will surely say, as if there had never been between you and him any affection, “Oh, I wish I had been with them; then I would have achieved a great attainment.”
4:74-76	"Let those fight in the cause of Allah who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter. And whoever fights in the cause of Allah and is killed or is victorious - We will surely give him a great reward. And what is [the matter] with you that you fight not in the cause of Allah and of the oppressed among men, women, and children who say, ""Our Lord, take us out of this city whose people are oppressors and appoint for us from Yourself a protector and appoint for us from Yourself a helper."" Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of false gods. So fight against the allies of Satan. Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak."
4:77-79	"Have you not considered those to whom it was said, ""Restrain your hands and establish prayer and give zakah?"" But when fighting was prescribed for them, at once a party of them feared the people as they feared Allah or even more, and they said, ""Our Lord, why did You decree fighting upon us? Why did You not delay us for a short term?"" Say, ""The enjoyment of this world is little, and the Hereafter is better for him who fears Allah. And you will not be wronged a thread."" Wherever you may be, death will overtake you, even if you were within lofty towers. And if good befalls them, they say, ""This is from Allah,"" but if evil befalls them, they say, ""This is from you."" Say, ""All is from Allah."" So what is the matter with these people that they can hardly understand a word? Whatever good befalls you is from Allah, and whatever evil befalls you is from yourself. And We have sent you to the people as a messenger, and sufficient is Allah as a Witness."
4:80-84	"Whoever obeys the Messenger has obeyed Allah, but whoever turns away - then We have not sent you over them as a guardian. And they say, ""We obey."" But when they depart from you, a party of them plans something other than what you say. And Allah records what they plan, so turn away from them and rely upon Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs. Do they not then consider the Qur'an carefully? Had it been from other than Allah, they would have found therein much discrepancy. And when there comes to them information about security or fear, they broadcast it. But if they had referred it to the Messenger or to those in authority among them, then those who are able to extract it would have known about it. And had it not been for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy, you would have followed Satan, except for a few. So fight in the cause of Allah; you are not charged except with yourself, and urge the believers on. Perhaps Allah will restrain the violence of those who disbelieve. And Allah is stronger in violence and stronger in punishment."
4:85-87	Whoever intercedes with a good intercession will have a share of it, and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession will have a share of it. And ever is Allah, over all things, Watchful. And when you are greeted with a greeting, greet in return with one better than it, or (at least) return it equally. Indeed, Allah is ever, over all things, a Taker of Account. Allah - there is no deity except Him - He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt. And who is more truthful than Allah in statement?
4:88-89	What is the matter with you that you are two parties concerning the hypocrites while Allah has driven them back for what they have earned? Do you wish to guide one whom Allah has sent astray? And whomever Allah sends astray - you will never find for him a way. They wish that you would disbelieve as they disbelieved so you would be alike. So do not take from among them allies until they emigrate in the cause of Allah. But if they turn away, then seize them and kill them wherever you find them. And do not take from among them any friend or helper.
4:90-91	Except for those who join a people between you and whom there is a treaty, or who come to you, their hearts constrained from fighting you or fighting their people. And if Allah had willed, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you. But if they withdraw from you and do not fight you and offer you peace, then Allah has not given you a way against them. You will find others who desire security from you and security from their people. Every time they are returned to persecution, they plunge into it. But if they do not withdraw from you and offer you peace and restrain their hands, then seize them and kill them wherever you overtake them. And over those We have given you a clear authority.
4:92-93	It is not for a believer to kill a believer except by mistake. And whoever kills a believer by mistake, then the freeing of a believing slave and a compensation payment to be made to his family unless they give up. But if he is from a people hostile to you, and he is a believer, then the freeing of a believing slave. And if he is from a people between whom and you there is a treaty, then a ransom payment to his family and the freeing of a believing slave. But whoever cannot find [any] [means] then a fast of two consecutive months as repentance from Allah. And ever is Allah Knowing and Wise. And whoever kills a believer intentionally - his recompense is Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah has become angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a great punishment.
4:94-94	"O you who have believed, when you go forth in the cause of Allah, investigate and do not say to one who offers you peace, ""You are not a believer,"" seeking the goods of worldly life. But with Allah are many gains. Thus were you before, but Allah has conferred favor upon you, so investigate. Indeed, Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted."
4:95-96	Not equal are those believers who sit (at home), other than those who have a disability, and those who strive in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives. Allah has preferred those who strive with their wealth and their lives over those who sit (at home), by a degree. But to all Allah has promised good, but Allah has preferred those who strive over those who sit (at home) with a great reward. Degrees from Him and forgiveness and mercy. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
4:97-100	"Indeed, those whom the angels take in death while they are wronging themselves - they will say, ""In what condition were you?"" They will say, ""We were oppressed on the earth."" They will say, ""Was not the earth of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?"" For those, their refuge is Hell, and evil it is as a destination. Except for the oppressed among men, women and children who are unable to devise a plan nor are they shown a way. For them it is hoped that Allah will pardon them. And Allah is Forgiving and Forgiving. And whoever emigrates for the cause of Allah will find on the earth many [alternative] locations and abundance. And whoever emigrates for the sake of Allah and His Messenger and then death overtakes him - his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."
4:101-103	And when you travel throughout the land, there is no blame upon you for shortening the prayer if you fear that those who disbelieve may harm you. Indeed, the disbelievers are to you a clear enemy. And when you are among them and lead them in prayer, let one party of them stand with you and take their arms. And when they prostrate, let them be behind you and let another party come up who have not prayed and let them pray with you and take their precautions and their arms. Those who disbelieve wish that you would neglect your weapons and your baggage so that they could attack you with a single attack. And there is no blame upon you, if you are troubled by rain or you are ill, for you to lay down your weapons and take your precautions. Indeed, Allah has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. So when you have completed the prayer, remember Allah standing, sitting, or [lying] on your sides. And when you are secure, then establish prayer. Indeed, prayer has been decreed upon the believers a decree of specified times.
4:104-104	And do not weaken in pursuit of the enemy. If you should be suffering, they are suffering as you are. And you hope from Allah that which they do not hope for. And ever is Allah Knowing and Wise.
4:105-105	Indeed, We have sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth so that you may judge between the people by that which Allah has shown you, and do not be an advocate for the deceitful.
4:106-109	And seek forgiveness of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Indeed, Allah does not like anyone who is a treacherous sinner. They hide from the people but do not hide from Allah, and He is with them when they spend the night in speech that which does not please Him. And ever is Allah encompassing of what they do. Here you are - you argued on their behalf in worldly life. But who will argue on their behalf with Allah on the Day of Resurrection, or who will be a guardian over them?
4:110-112	And whoever does evil or wrongs himself but then seeks forgiveness from Allah will find Allah Forgiving and Merciful. And whoever earns a sin only earns it against himself. And ever is Allah Knowing and Wise. And whoever earns a sin or a crime and then attributes it to an innocent person has certainly taken upon himself a slander and a manifest sin.
4:113-113	And had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, a party of them would have resolved to mislead you. But they mislead only themselves, and they will not harm you at all. And Allah has sent down upon you the Book and wisdom and taught you that which you did not know. And ever has the grace of Allah upon you been great.
4:114-115	There is no good in much of their private conversation, except for [those] who enjoin charity or righteousness or conciliation between people. And whoever does that seeking means to the approval of Allah - then We are going to give him a great reward. And whoever contradicts the Messenger after guidance has become clear to him and follows other than the way of the believers - We will give him what he has taken and drive him into Hell, and evil it is as a destination.
4:116-116	Indeed, Allah does not forgive association with Him, but He forgives what is less than that for whomever He wills. And whoever associates others with Allah has certainly gone far astray.
4:117-121	"They invoke not besides Him except female deities, and they invoke not but a rebellious devil. Allah has cursed him and said, ""I will surely take from among Your servants a specified portion. And I will mislead them and arouse in them false desires. And I will command them to slit the ears of cattle and I will command them to change the creation of Allah. And whoever takes Satan as an ally instead of Allah has certainly sustained a clear loss. He makes promises to them and arouses false desires in them, but Satan does not promise them except delusion. For those, their refuge is Hell, and they will find no escape from it."
4:122-126	And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. The promise of Allah is truth. And who is more truthful than Allah in statement? It is not according to your desires, nor according to the desires of the People of the Scripture. Whoever does evil will be recompensed for it, and he will not find besides Allah any protector or helper. And whoever does righteous deeds, whether male or female, while he is a believer - those will enter Paradise and will not be wronged, [even] as much as the speck on a date seed. And who is better in religion than one who submits himself to Allah while being a doer of good and follows the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth? And Allah took Abraham as a friend. And to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and ever is Allah encompassing of all things.
4:127-127	"They ask you concerning women. Say, ""Allah gives you a legal opinion concerning them and what is recited to you in the Book concerning orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed for them and whom you desire to marry, and concerning the weak and oppressed among children, and concerning you acting justly toward orphans. And whatever good you do - indeed, Allah is ever Knowing of it."""
4:128-130	And if a woman fears on her husband's part ill-treatment or desertion, there is no blame upon them if they make terms of settlement between themselves - and settlement is best. But souls are inclined to stinginess. But if you do good and fear God - then indeed, God is ever, with what you do, Acquainted. And you will never be able to be equal between wives, even if you should strive to do so. So do not incline completely [toward one] and leave her hanging. But if you make terms of settlement and fear God - then indeed, God is ever Forgiving and Merciful. And if they separate, God will enrich each of them from His abundance. And ever is God Encompassing and Wise.
4:131-134	To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And We have enjoined upon those who were given the Scripture before you and upon you that you fear God. But if you disbelieve - then to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And ever is God Free of need and Praiseworthy. And to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is God as Disposer of affairs. If He wills, He can do away with you, O mankind, and bring forth others. And ever is God over that competent. Whoever desires the reward of this world - then with God is the reward of this world and the Hereafter. And ever is God Hearing and Seeing.
4:135-136	O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm in justice, witnesses for Allah, even if it be against yourselves or parents and relatives. Whether one is rich or poor, Allah is more worthy of both. So follow not [your] own desire, lest you be just. And if you distort [your speech] or turn aside, then indeed, Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted. O you who have believed, believe in Allah and His Messenger and the Book which He revealed to His Messenger and the Book which He revealed before. And whoever disbelieves in Allah and His angels and His books and His messengers and the Last Day has certainly strayed far astray.
4:137-139	Indeed, those who believed, then disbelieved, then believed, then disbelieved, and then increased in disbelief - never will Allah forgive them, nor will He guide them to a way. Give tidings to the hypocrites that they will have a painful punishment. Those who take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers - do they seek honor with them? But indeed, honor belongs to Allah entirely.
4:140-143	"And it has been revealed to you in the Book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and ridiculed, then do not sit with them until they engage in another conversation. Indeed, in that case, you would be like them. Indeed, Allah will gather the hypocrites and the disbelievers in Hell all together. Those who lie in wait for you - if you have a victory from Allah, they say, ""Were we not with you?"" But if the disbelievers have a share, they say, ""Did we not gain control over you and protect you from the believers?"" So Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection. And Allah will never grant the disbelievers a way over the believers. Indeed, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allah, but it is He who will deceive them. And when they stand up for prayer, they stand with laziness, showing off to the people and not remembering Allah except a little. Wavering between that, neither with these nor with those. And he whom Allah sends astray - you will not find for him a way."
4:144-145	O you who have believed, do not take the disbelievers as allies instead of the believers. Do you wish to give Allah a clear authority over you? Indeed, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the Fire. And never will you find for them a helper.
4:146-147	Except for those who repent and reform and hold fast to Allah and devote their religion to Allah alone - those will be with the believers. And Allah will give the believers a great reward. What would Allah do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe? And ever is Allah Appreciative and Knowing.
4:148-149	Allah does not like the public mention of evil except by one who has been wronged. And ever is Allah Hearing and Knowing. Whether you disclose good or conceal it or pardon an offense - indeed, Allah is ever Pardoning and Competent.
4:150-152	"Indeed, those who disbelieve in Allah and His messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His messengers and say, ""We believe in some and disbelieve in others,"" and wish to adopt a way in between - those are the disbelievers, truly. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating punishment. But those who believe in Allah and His messengers and make no distinction between any of them - those - He will give them their reward. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful."
4:153-161	The People of the Scripture ask you to bring down to them a book from the heaven. And they asked Moses even greater than that, saying, “Show us Allah plainly.” So the thunderbolt seized them for their wrongdoing. Then they took the calf after clear proofs had come to them, so We pardoned that and gave Moses clear authority. And We raised the Mount above them with their covenant and said to them, “Enter the gate prostrating.” And We said to them, “Do not transgress on the Sabbath.” And We took from them a solemn covenant. Then because they broke their covenant and disbelieved in the signs of Allah and killed the prophets without right and said, “Our hearts are covered.” Rather, Allah has set a seal upon them because of their disbelief, so they will not believe except a few. And because of their disbelief and their saying against Mary a great slander and their saying, “Indeed, we killed the Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, the Messenger of Allah.” But they killed him not, nor did they crucify him, but it appeared so to them. And those who differ therein are in doubt about it. They have no knowledge thereof except the following of assumptions. And they killed him not, for certain. Rather, Allah raised him up to Himself. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. There is none from the People of the Scripture but that he will surely believe in him before his death. And on the Day of Resurrection he will be against them a witness. But because of the wrongdoing of those who are Jews, We prohibited to them [certain] good things which had been lawful to them, and because of their averting many from the way of Allah, and because of their taking interest although they had been forbidden it, and their consuming the wealth of people unjustly. And We have prepared for the disbelievers among them a painful punishment.
4:162-162	But those among them who are firm in knowledge and the believers believe in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what was revealed before you, and those who establish prayer and give zakah and believe in God and the Last Day - those - We will give them a great reward.
4:163-166	Indeed, We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], just as We revealed to Noah and the prophets after him. And We revealed to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, and the Tribes, and Jesus, Job, Jonah, Aaron, and Solomon. And We gave David the Psalms. And messengers We have mentioned to you before and messengers We have not mentioned to you. And God spoke to Moses directly - messengers as bearers of good tidings and warners - so that mankind will have no argument against God after the messengers. And ever is God Exalted in Might and Wise. But God bears witness to what He has revealed to you. He has sent it down with His knowledge, and the angels bear witness. And sufficient is God as Witness.
4:167-169	Indeed, those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of Allah have certainly strayed far astray. Indeed, those who disbelieve and wrong - Allah will not forgive them, nor will He guide them to a way except the way of Hell, wherein they will abide forever. And that, for Allah, is easy.
4:170-170	O mankind, there has come to you the Messenger with the truth from your Lord, so believe - it is better for you. But if you disbelieve - then to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. And ever is God Knowing and Wise.
4:171-172	"O People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion and do not say about Allah except the truth. The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was only the Messenger of Allah and His Word which He directed to Mary and a spirit from Him. So believe in Allah and His messengers and do not say, ""Three."" Desist; it is better for you. Allah is only one God. Exalted is He above having a son. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs. The Messiah will not disdain to be a servant of Allah, nor will the angels brought near (to Him). And whoever disdains His worship and is arrogant - He will gather them all together."
4:173-175	As for those who believed and did righteous deeds, He will pay them their reward in full and increase them from His bounty. But as for those who disdained and were arrogant, He will punish them with a painful punishment, and they will not find for themselves besides Allah any protector or helper. O mankind, there has come to you a proof from your Lord, and We have sent down to you a clear light. But as for those who believed in Allah and held fast to Him, He will admit them to mercy from Him and bounty and guide them to Himself on a straight path.
4:176-176	They ask you for a legal opinion. Say, “Allah gives you a legal opinion concerning those who are not inherited from others. If a man dies and leaves no child, but has a sister, she shall have half of what he leaves, and he shall inherit from her. If he leaves no child, then if there are two sisters, they shall have two-thirds of what he leaves. If there are brothers and sisters, the male shall have the share of two females. Allah makes clear to you, lest you go astray. And Allah is Knowing of all things.”
5:1-2	O you who have believed, fulfill [all] contracts. Lawful to you are the beast of grazing livestock, except what is recited to you, excluding game while you are in a state of ihram. Indeed, Allah decrees what He intends. O you who have believed, do not violate the rites of Allah or the sacred month or the offerings or the garlands or those entering the Sacred House, seeking bounty from their Lord and approval. And when you are in ihram, then hunt. And do not let hatred of a people because they have prevented you from al-Masjid al-Haram incite you to transgress. And cooperate in righteousness and piety, but do not cooperate in sin and aggression. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.
5:3-3	Forbidden to you are dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah, and the strangled, or the beaten, or the fallen, or the gored, and that which a wild animal has eaten, except that which you slaughter, and that which is slaughtered on stone altars, and that you seek lots with arrows - that is grave disobedience. Today those who disbelieve have despaired of [defeating] your religion, so fear them not, but fear Me. Today I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion. But whoever is forced by severe hunger with no inclination to sin - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
5:4-5	They ask you, [O Muhammad], what is lawful for them. Say, “Lawful to you are [all] good [things] and what you have trained of hunting dogs, training them from what Allah has taught you. So eat of what they catch for you and mention the name of Allah over it and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is swift in account. This day [all] good [things] are lawful for you, and the food of those who were given the Scripture is lawful for you and your food is lawful for them. [And] chaste women from among the believers and chaste women from among those who were given the Scripture before you, when you have given them their due compensation, chastely, not fornicating nor taking [secret] lovers. And whoever disbelieves in the faith - his work has become worthless, and he, in the Hereafter, will be among the losers.”
5:6-6	O you who have believed, when you rise to [perform] prayer, wash your faces and your forearms to the elbows and wipe over your heads and your feet to the ankles. And if you are in a state of major ritual impurity, then purify yourself. But if you are ill or on a journey or one of you comes from the relieving himself or you have contacted women and you find no water, then seek clean earth and wipe your faces and your hands therewith. Allah does not intend to place difficulty on you, but He intends to purify you and complete His favor upon you that you may be grateful.
5:7-8	"And remember the favor of Allah upon you and His covenant which He bound you when you said, ""We hear and we obey."" And fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts. O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness. And fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do."
5:9-10	Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds forgiveness and a great reward. But those who disbelieve and deny Our verses - those are the companions of Hellfire.
5:11-11	O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when a people intended to extend their hands against you, but He withheld their hands from you and fear Allah; and upon Allah let the believers rely.
5:12-13	"And Allah had already taken a covenant from the Children of Israel, and We raised up from among them twelve leaders. And Allah said, ""Indeed, I am with you. If you establish prayer and give zakah and believe in My messengers and support them and loan Allah a goodly loan, I will surely remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever disbelieves after that among you has certainly strayed from the right path."" So because they broke their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts hard. They distort words from their [proper] usages and have forgotten a portion of that of which they were reminded. And you will not cease to uncover treachery among them, except for a few of them. So pardon them and overlook. Indeed, Allah loves the doers of good."
5:14-14	"And among those who said, ""We are Christians,"" We took their covenant, but they forgot a portion of that of which they were reminded. So We stirred up among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. And God will inform them about what they used to do."
5:15-17	O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture and overlooking much. There has come to you from Allah a light and a clear Book. By it Allah guides those who pursue His pleasure to the ways of peace and brings them out from darknesses into the light, by His permission, and guides them to a straight path. They have certainly disbelieved who say, “Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.” Say, “Then who could have control over Allah at all if He had willed to destroy the Messiah, the son of Mary, and his mother, and whoever is on the earth entirely?” To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. He creates what He wills, and Allah is over all things competent.
5:18-19	"The Jews and the Christians say, ""We are the children of God and His beloved."" Say, ""Then why does He punish you for your sins?"" Rather, you are human beings from among those He created. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And to God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and to Him is the final destination. O People of the Scripture, there has come to you Our Messenger making clear to you much [more] after a period of messengers, lest you say, ""There came to us no bringer of good tidings or a warner."" But there has come to you a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and God is over all things competent."
5:20-26	"And remember [mention] when Moses said to his people, ""O my people, remember the favor of Allah upon you when He made among you prophets and made you kings and gave you that which He had not given to anyone else in the worlds. O my people, enter the Holy Land which Allah has assigned to you and do not turn back [from it] and [thus] become losers."" They said, ""O Moses, indeed within it is a people of tyrants, and we will never enter it until they leave it. But if they leave it, then we will enter."" Two men from among those who feared, upon whom Allah had bestowed favor, said, ""Enter upon them through the gate, and when you have entered it, you will be predominant. And upon Allah rely, if you should be believers."" They said, ""O Moses, indeed we will never enter it as long as they are within it. So go, you and your Lord, and fight. Indeed, we will remain right here."" He said, ""My Lord, indeed I do not control except myself and my brother, so separate us from the defiantly disobedient people."" He said, ""Indeed, it will be forbidden to them for forty years while they wander throughout the land. So do not grieve over the defiantly disobedient people."""
5:27-31	"And recite to them the news of the two sons of Adam in truth, when they offered a sacrifice, and it was accepted from one of them but not from the other. He said, ""I will surely kill you."" He said, ""Allah only accepts from those who fear Him. If you should stretch out your hand against me to kill me, I will not stretch out my hand against you to kill you. Indeed, I fear Allah, Lord of the worlds. Indeed, I want you to bear my sin and your sin and be among the companions of the Fire. And that is the recompense of the wrongdoers."" But his soul prompted him to kill his brother, so he killed him and became among the losers. Then Allah sent a raven, scratching the ground to show him how to hide the shame of his brother. He said, ""Woe to me! Am I unable to be like this raven and hide the shame of my brother?"" So he became among the regretful."
5:32-34	For that reason We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption done in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves a life - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. And Our messengers had certainly come to them with clear proofs; then indeed, many of them after that were transgressors upon the earth. The only reward of those who wage war upon Allah and His Messenger and strive after corruption upon the earth is that they shall be killed or crucified or their hands and feet shall be cut off on alternate sides or they shall be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter theirs is a great punishment - Except for those who repent before you have them in your power. Then know that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
5:35-37	O you who have believed, fear Allah and seek the means of approach to Him and strive in His cause that you may succeed. Indeed, those who disbelieve - if they had all that is in the earth and as much more with it to ransom themselves thereby from the punishment of the Day of Resurrection - it would not be accepted from them, and they will have a painful punishment. They desire to get out of the Fire, but they will never get out of it, and they will have an enduring punishment.
5:38-40	As for the thief, male or female, cut off their hands as a punishment for what they have committed, an exemplary punishment from Allah. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. But whoever repents after his wrongdoing and amends, then indeed, Allah will turn to him in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Do you not know that to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth? He punishes whom He wills and forgives whom He wills. And Allah is over all things competent.
5:41-43	"O Messenger, let not those grieve you who hasten into disbelief - from among those who say, ""We believe"" with their mouths, but whose hearts do not believe - and from among the Jews - listeners to falsehood, listeners to another people who have not come to you, distorting words from their [proper] usages, saying, ""If you are given this, then take it, but if you are not given it, then beware."" And he whom Allah intends to test, you will not possess for him anything from Allah. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah did not intend to purify. For them is disgrace in this world, and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment. They listeners to falsehood, devourers of unlawful things. So if they come to you, then judge between them or turn away from them. But if you turn away from them, they will not harm you at all. And if you judge, then judge between them with justice. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. And how can they make you judge while they have the Torah, in which is the judgment of Allah? Then they turn away after that. And those are not believers."
5:44-47	Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who submitted [to God] judged by it for those who were Jews, and [so did] the rabbis and the scholars by what they were entrusted with of the Scripture of God and were witnesses thereto. So do not fear the people, but fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for a small price. And whoever does not judge by what God has revealed - then those are the disbelievers. And We ordained for them therein: A life for a life, an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose, an ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and for wounds there is retaliation. But whoever gives charity therein, it will be an expiation for him. And whoever does not judge by what God has revealed - then those are the wrongdoers. And We followed in their footsteps with Jesus, the son of Mary, confirming that which came before him of the Torah. And We gave him the Gospel, in which was guidance and light and confirming that which came before it of the Torah and a guidance and instruction for the righteous. And let the People of the Gospel judge by what God has revealed therein. And whoever does not judge by what God has revealed - then those are the defiantly disobedient.
5:48-50	And We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, confirming what preceded it of the Scripture and as a criterion over it. So judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations away from the truth that has come to you. To each of you We prescribed a law and a method. Had Allah willed, He would have made you one community, but [that He might] test you in what He has given you, so race to [all] good things. To Allah is your return all together, and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ. And judge between them by what Allah has revealed and do not follow their inclinations and beware of them, lest they tempt you away from some of what Allah has revealed to you. But if they turn away, then know that Allah only intends to afflict them for some of their sins. And indeed, many of the people are defiantly disobedient. Is it the judgment of [the time of] ignorance that they seek? And who is better than Allah in judgment for a people who are certain [in faith].
5:51-53	"O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are [in fact] allies of one another. And whoever takes them as allies among you - then indeed, he is [one] of them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. Then you will see those in whose hearts is disease hastening into them, saying, ""We fear that a misfortune may strike us."" But perhaps Allah will bring about victory or a decision from Him, and they will become, over what they concealed within themselves, regretful. And those who believed will say, ""Are these the ones who swore by Allah with their most solemn oaths that they were with you?"" Their deeds have become worthless, and they have become losers."
5:54-56	O you who have believed, whoever of you should revert from his religion - Allah will bring forth [in place of them] a people He will love and who will love Him [who are] humble toward the believers, powerful against the disbelievers; they strive in the cause of Allah and do not fear the blame of a critic. That is the bounty of Allah which He bestows upon whom He wills, and Allah is all-Encompassing and Knowing. Your ally is only Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed - those who establish prayer and give zakah, while they bow in prayer. And whoever takes Allah and His Messenger and those who have believed as allies - then indeed, the party of Allah - it is they who will be predominant.
5:57-58	O you who have believed, do not take as allies those who take your religion in ridicule and amusement among those who were given the Scripture before you or the disbelievers. And fear Allah, if you are believers. And when you call to prayer, they take it in ridicule and amusement. That is because they are a people who do not reason.
5:59-60	"Say, ""O People of the Scripture, do you blame us for anything except that we believe in Allah and in what was revealed to us and what was revealed before and that most of you are defiantly disobedient?"" Say, ""Shall I inform you of [someone] worse than that as a reward from Allah? Those whom Allah has cursed and with whom He became angry and made of them apes and pigs and who worshipped false gods. Those are worse in position and further astray from the right way."""
5:61-64	"And when they come to you, they say, ""We believe,"" while they entered in disbelief, and they have already exited it. And Allah is most knowing of what they were concealing. And you will see many of them hastening into sin and aggression and their consuming of what is unlawful. Evil is that which they do. Why do not the rabbis and the scholars forbid them from their sinful speech and their consuming of what is unlawful? Evil is that which they do. And the Jews say, ""The hand of Allah is chained."" Chained are their hands, and cursed are they for what they say. Rather, His hands are extended; He spends as He wills. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. And We have cast among them animosity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection. Whenever they kindle the fire of war, Allah extinguishes it. And they strive to cause corruption in the land, and Allah does not like corrupters."
5:65-66	And if only the People of the Scripture had believed and feared Allah, We would have removed from them their misdeeds and admitted them to gardens of pleasure. And if they had upheld the Torah and the Gospel and what was revealed to them from their Lord, they would have consumed from above them and from beneath their feet. Among them is a community moderate, but many of them - evil is what they do.
5:67-69	"O Messenger, announce that which has been revealed to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. And Allah will protect you from the people. Indeed, Allah does not guide the disbelieving people. Say, ""O People of the Scripture, you are not upon anything until you uphold the Torah and the Gospel and what has been revealed to you from your Lord. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord will surely increase many of them in transgression and disbelief. So do not grieve over the disbelieving people. Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans - those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and do righteousness - no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve."
5:70-71	We took a covenant from the Children of Israel and sent to them messengers. Every time there came to them a messenger with what their souls did not desire, a party they denied and a party they killed. And they thought that there would be no trial, so they became blind and deaf. Then Allah turned to them in forgiveness; then many of them became blind and deaf. And Allah is Seeing of what they do.
5:72-73	They have certainly disbelieved who say, “God is the Messiah, the son of Mary.” And the Messiah said, “O Children of Israel, worship God, my Lord and your Lord.” Indeed, whoever associates others with God - God has forbidden him Paradise, and his refuge is the Fire. And there are not for the wrongdoers any helpers. They have certainly disbelieved who say, “God is the third of three.” And there is no god except one God. And if they do not desist from what they are saying, there will surely afflict those who disbelieve among them a painful punishment.
5:74-77	Will they not then repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. The Messiah, son of Mary, was no more than a messenger; [other] messengers passed away before him. His mother was a woman of truth. They both used to eat food. See how We make clear to them the signs; then see how they are deluded. Say, “Do you worship besides Allah that which has no power to harm you or to benefit you?” And Allah is the Hearing, the Knowing. Say, “O People of the Scripture, do not exceed limits in your religion beyond the truth and do not follow the inclinations of a people who had gone astray before and misled many and strayed from the right way.”
5:78-81	Cursed were those who disbelieved among the Children of Israel by the tongue of David and Jesus, the son of Mary. That was because they disobeyed and were ever transgressors. They used not to forbid one another from the evil they did. Evil was that which they were doing. You will see many of them taking as allies those who disbelieved. Evil is that which their souls have put forward for them - that Allah is angry with them, and in the punishment they will abide eternally. And if they had believed in Allah and the Prophet and what was revealed to him, they would not have taken them as allies. But many of them are wicked.
5:82-86	"You will surely find the most intense of the people in animosity toward the believers to be the Jews and those who associate others with God. And you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers to be those who say, ""We are Christians."" That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant. And when they hear what has been revealed to the Messenger, you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of what they have recognized of the truth. They say, ""Our Lord, we have believed, so register us among the witnesses."" And why should we not believe in Allah and what has come to us of the truth and hope that our Lord will admit us with the righteous people? So Allah rewarded them for what they said with gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the reward of the doers of good. But those who disbelieved and denied Our verses - those are the companions of Hellfire."
5:87-88	O you who have believed, do not prohibit the good things which Allah has made lawful to you and do not transgress. Indeed, Allah does not like transgressors. And eat of what Allah has provided for you [which is] lawful and good, and fear Allah, in whom you are believers.
5:89-89	Allah will not impose blame upon you for what is unintentional in your oaths, but He will impose blame upon you for your deliberate oaths. For its expiation, feed ten needy persons from the average of that with which you feed your own families, or clothe them, or free a slave. But whoever cannot find [a slave] - then a fast of three days. That is the expiation for your oaths when you have sworn. But guard your oaths. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be grateful.
5:90-93	O you who have believed, indeed, intoxicants, gambling, [sacrificing on] stone alters [to other than God], and divining arrows are but defilement from the work of Satan, so avoid it that you may be successful. Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicants and gambling and avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayer. So will you not desist? And obey Allah and obey the Messenger and beware. But if you turn away - then know that upon Our Messenger is only the clear notification. There is no blame upon those who believe and do righteous deeds for what they have eaten as long as they fear Allah and believe and do righteous deeds and then fear Allah and believe and then fear Allah and do good - and Allah loves the doers of good.
5:94-95	O you who have believed, Allah will surely test you with something of the game that your hands and spears reach that He may make evident who fears Him unseen. But whoever transgresses after that will have a painful punishment. O you who have believed, do not kill game while you are in a state of ihram. And whoever among you kills it intentionally - the penalty is an equivalent of what he killed from sacrificial animals, as judged by two just men among you, as an offering delivered to the Kaaba, or an expiation - the feeding of poor people, or the equivalent of that in fasting - so that he may taste the evil consequences of his deed. Allah has pardoned what is past, but whoever returns [to the religion] - Allah will take retribution from him. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution.
5:96-100	Lawful to you is game from the sea and its food as provision for you and for the travelers, but forbidden to you is game from the land as long as you are in the state of ihram. And fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered. Allah has made the Kaaba, the Sacred House, a means of support for the people, and the sacred month, and the offerings, and the garlands. That is so that you may know that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and that Allah is Knowing of all things. Know that Allah is severe in penalty, and that Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. The Messenger’s duty is only to convey [the message], and Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal. Say, “Not equal are the bad and the good, even though the abundance of the bad impresses you.” So fear Allah, O you of understanding, that you may succeed.
5:101-102	O you who have believed, do not ask about things which, if they are made known to you, will distress you. But if you ask about them when the Qur’an is being revealed, they will be made known to you. Allah has pardoned them. And Allah is Forgiving and Forbearing. A people before you did ask about them; then they became disbelievers therein.
5:103-105	Allah has not ordained any Bahīrah, nor Ṣa’ibah, nor wasīlah, nor Ḥām. But those who disbelieve invent falsehood about Allah, and most of them do not reason. And when it is said to them, “Come to what Allah has revealed and to the Messenger,” they say, “Sufficient for us is that upon which we found our fathers.” Even though their fathers did not know anything, nor were they guided? O you who have believed, upon you is yourselves. He who strays will not harm you if you are guided. To Allah is your return all together, and He will inform you about what you used to do.
5:106-108	"O you who have believed, let there be testimony among you when death approaches one of you at the time of making a will - two just men from among you, or two others from outside you. If you travel through the land and the disaster of death befalls you, detain them after the prayer and let them swear by God if you have doubts, ""We will not exchange him for a price, even if he were a relative, nor will we conceal the testimony of God. Indeed, in that case we would be among the sinners."" But if it is found that they have deserved a sin, then two others from among those against whom the first two have deserved a sin should take their place and let them swear by God, ""Our testimony is more valid than their testimony, and we have not transgressed. Indeed, in that case we would be among the wrongdoers."" That is more likely that they will give testimony properly or fear that oaths will be rejected after their oaths. And fear God and listen. And God does not guide the wicked people."
5:109-109	The Day when God will gather the messengers and say, “What was your answer?” They will say, “We have no knowledge. Indeed, it is You who is the Knower of the unseen.”
5:110-111	When God said, “O Jesus, son of Mary, remember My favor upon you and upon your mother when I supported you with the Holy Spirit so that you spoke to the people in the cradle and in maturity, and when I taught you the Book and wisdom and the Torah and the Gospel, and when you created from clay, [as it were] the figure of a bird, with My permission, and breathed into it and it became a bird with My permission, and you healed the blind and the leper with My permission, and when you brought forth the dead with My permission, and when I held back the Children of Israel from you when you came to them with clear proofs, but those who disbelieved among them said, “This is not but obvious magic.” And when I inspired to the disciples, “Believe in Me and in My Messenger,” they said, “We believe, and bear witness that we are Muslims [in submission].”
5:112-115	"When the disciples said, ""O Jesus, son of Mary, can your Lord send down to us a table spread with food from the heaven?"" He said, ""Fear Allah, if you should be believers."" They said, ""We want to eat from it and our hearts will be reassured and we will know that you have told us the truth and we will be among its witnesses."" Jesus, son of Mary, said, ""O Allah, our Lord, send down to us a table spread with food from the heaven that it may be for us a celebration for the first of us and the last of us and a sign from You. And provide for us, for You are the best of providers."" Allah said, ""Indeed, I will send it down to you. But whoever among you disbelieves thereafter - then I will punish him with a punishment by which I have punished no one among the worlds."""
5:116-120	"And remember when Allah said, ""O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to the people, 'Take me and my mother as gods besides Allah?'"" He said, ""Glory be to You! It is not for me to say that which I have no right to. If I had said it, You would have known it. You know what is within myself, and I do not know what is within Yourself. Indeed, You are the Knower of the unseen. I said to them nothing except what You commanded me, 'Worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord.' And I was a witness over them as long as I was among them. But when You took me up, You were the Observer over them, and You are, over all things, Witness. If You should punish them - indeed, they are Your servants; but if You forgive them - indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" Allah said, ""This is a Day when the truthful will benefit from their truthfulness. For them are gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is the great attainment. To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is in them, and He is over all things competent."
6:1-3	Praise be to Allah, Who created the heavens and the earth and made darkness and light. Then those who disbelieve equate others with their Lord. It is He who created you from clay and then decreed a term and a specified term is with Him, then you are in doubt. And He is Allah in the heavens and on the earth. He knows your secret and your public and knows what you earn.
6:4-7	"And there does not come to them a sign from the signs of their Lord but they turn away from it. They have denied the truth when it came to them. So there will come to them news of that which they used to ridicule. Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them? We established them upon the earth as We have not established you. And We sent down upon them abundant rain and made rivers flow beneath them. Then We destroyed them for their sins and brought forth after them another generation. And if We had sent down to you a book on paper and they had touched it with their hands, those who disbelieved would have said, ""This is not but obvious magic."""
6:8-11	"And they said, ""Why was an angel not sent down to him?"" And if We had sent down an angel, the matter would have been decided, and then they would not have been reprieved. And if We had made him an angel, We would have made him a man, and We would have confused for them what they confuse. And messengers before you were mocked, but that which they used to mock encompassed those who ridiculed them. Say, ""Travel through the land and observe what was the end of those who denied."""
6:12-18	"Say, ""To whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth?"" Say, ""To God! He has decreed upon Himself mercy that He will surely gather you together on the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt."" Those who have lost themselves - they will not believe. And to Him belongs whatever dwells in the night and the day, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing. Say, ""Shall I take as a protector other than God, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, while He feeds and is not fed?"" Say, ""Indeed, I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit [to God], and do not be of those who associate others with God."" Say, ""Indeed, I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day."" He from whom it is averted that Day - indeed, He has mercy. And that is the clear attainment. And if God should touch you with adversity, there is no remover of it except Him; and if He touches you with good - then He is over all things competent. And He is the Prevailing, above His servants. And He is the Wise, the Acquainted."""
6:19-21	"Say, ""What is greater in testimony?"" Say, ""Allah is witness between me and you, and this Qur'an has been revealed to me that I may warn you thereby and whomever it reaches. Do you indeed bear witness that there are other deities with Allah?"" Say, ""I do not bear witness."" Say, ""He is only One God, and indeed, I am innocent of what you associate with Him."" Those to whom We have given the Scripture recognize him as they recognize their own sons. Those who have lost themselves - so they will not believe. And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah or denies His verses? Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed."
6:22-26	"And the Day We will gather them all together, then We will say to those who associated others with Allah, ""Where are your associates whom you used to claim?"" Then their only trial was that they said, ""By God, our Lord, we were not polytheists."" See how they lied about themselves, and what they used to invent has gone astray from them. And among them are those who listen to you, but We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if they see every sign, they will not believe in it until, when they come to you, they argue with you. Those who disbelieve say, ""This is not but legends of the former peoples."" And they forbid it and keep away from it. And they destroy none but themselves, and they perceive not."
6:27-32	"And if you could but see when they are made to stand before the Fire and say, ""Oh, would that we could be sent back and not deny the signs of our Lord and be among the believers."" Rather, that which they concealed before will become apparent to them. And if they were returned, they would surely return to what they were forbidden, and indeed, they are liars. And they will say, ""There is not but our worldly life, and we will not be resurrected."" And if you could but see when they are made to stand before their Lord. He will say, ""Is this not the truth?"" They will say, ""Yes, by our Lord."" He will say, ""Then taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve."" Indeed, those who denied the meeting with Allah have lost out until, when the Hour comes upon them suddenly, they will say, ""Oh, [O Muhammad], how we regret what we neglected therein."" And they will bear their burdens on their backs. Unquestionably, evil is that which they bear. And what is the life of this world except play and amusement? But the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Then will you not reason?"
6:33-35	We certainly know that what they say grieves you - but it is not you they deny, but it is the verses of Allah that the wrongdoers reject. And messengers were denied before you, but they were patient over being denied and harmed until Our victory came to them. And there is no changing the words of Allah. And there has certainly come to you of the news of the messengers. And if their aversion is hard on you, then if you are able to seek a tunnel into the earth or a ladder into the heaven in order to bring them a sign. And if Allah had willed, He could have gathered them together upon guidance. So never be among the ignorant.
6:36-41	"Only those who listen respond, and the dead - Allah will resurrect them, then to Him they will be returned. And they say, ""Why was a sign not sent down to him from his Lord?"" Say, ""Indeed, Allah is able to send down a sign,"" but most of them do not know. And there is no creature on earth or bird that flies with its wings except that they are communities like you. We have not neglected anything in the Book; then to their Lord they will be gathered. And those who deny Our signs are deaf and dumb, within darknesses. Whom Allah wills - He sends astray, and whom He wills - He puts him on a straight path. Say, ""Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah should come upon you or the Hour should come upon you - would you call upon other than Allah, if you should be truthful?"" Rather, it is Him you call upon, and He will remove that to which you call upon Him, if He wills, and you will forget what you associate with Him."
6:42-45	And We had certainly sent to nations before you, and We seized them with poverty and hardship that perhaps they might humble themselves. But why, when Our punishment came to them, did they not humble themselves? But their hearts became hardened, and Satan made pleasing to them what they were doing. But when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We opened to them the doors of every [good] thing until, just as they rejoiced in that which they had been given, We seized them suddenly, and at once they were in despair. So He eliminated the root of the people who did wrong. And praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.
6:46-50	"Say, ""Have you considered, if Allah took away your hearing and your sight and set a seal upon your hearts, who is a god other than Allah who could bring them to you? See how We diversify the signs; yet they turn away."" Say, ""Have you considered, if the punishment of Allah should come upon you suddenly or openly, would any be destroyed except the wrongdoing people?"" And We send the messengers only as bringers of good tidings and warners. So whoever believes and reforms - no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve. But those who deny Our signs - the punishment will touch them because they used to commit wickedness. Say, ""I do not say to you, 'I have the treasures of Allah,' nor do I know the unseen, nor do I say to you, 'I am an angel.' I only follow what is revealed to me."" Say, ""Are the blind and the seeing equal? ​​Then will you not reflect?"""
6:51-52	And warn with it those who fear that they will be gathered before their Lord - they will have besides Him no protector or intercessor - that they may become righteous. And do not repel those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His countenance. You are not responsible for their account at all, nor are they responsible for your account at all, lest you drive them away and thus become among the wrongdoers.
6:53-58	And thus We have tried some of them by others that they may say, “Are these upon whom Allah has bestowed favor from among us?” Is not Allah most knowing of the grateful? And when those who believe in Our verses come to you, say, “Peace be upon you. Your Lord has decreed upon Himself mercy. That whoever of you does evil in ignorance and then repents after that and corrects himself - then indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful.” And thus do We explain the verses in detail, and that the way of the criminals may become clear. Say, “Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you invoke other than Allah.” Say, “I will not follow your desires. I would have gone astray then, and I would not be of the [rightly] guided.” Say, “Indeed, I am upon clear evidence from my Lord, and you have denied him. I do not have that which you are hastening upon. Judgment belongs only to Allah. He relates the truth, and He is the best of judges.” Say, “If I had that which you are hastening upon, the matter would have been decided between me and you. And Allah is most knowing of the wrongdoers.”
6:59-59	And with Him are the keys of the unseen, none knows them but He. And He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls but that He knows it. And no grain is there within the darknesses of the earth and no moist or dry [thing] but that it is [written] in a clear register.
6:60-62	It is He who takes your souls by night and knows what you have committed by day. Then He raises you up therein that a specified term may be fulfilled. Then to Him is your return. Then He will inform you of what you used to do. And He is the Prevailing over His servants. And He sends over you guardians until, when death comes to one of you, Our messengers take him, and they do not fail [in their duties]. Then they will be returned to Allah, their True Master. Unquestionably, His is the judgement, and He is the swiftest of reckoners.
6:63-67	"Say, ""Who saves you from the darknesses of the land and the sea? You call upon Him humbly and secretly, ""If He saves us from this, we will surely be among the grateful."" Say, ""Allah saves you from it and from every distress; then you associate [anything]."" Say, ""He is able to send upon you a punishment from above you or from beneath your feet or to confuse you into sects and make you taste the violence of one another."" See how We diversify the verses that they may understand. But your people have denied it, while it is the truth. Say, ""I am not a guardian over you. For every news there is a term [of time], and you are going to know."""
6:68-70	And when you see those who engage in [offensive] discourse concerning Our verses, then turn away from them until they engage in another conversation. And if Satan should cause you to forget, then do not remain after the reminder with the wrongdoing people. And there is not upon those who fear Allah any account [of their deeds], but [there is] a reminder that perhaps they will become righteous. And leave those who take their religion as play and amusement and whom the worldly life deceives, and remind thereby that a soul will perish for what it has earned. It will have not besides Allah any protector or intercessor. And if it should render all compensation, it will not be taken from it. Those are the ones who will perish for what they have earned. For them is a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment because they used to disbelieve.
6:71-73	"Say, ""Shall we call upon besides God that which neither benefits us nor harms us, and turn back on our heels after God has guided us, like one whom the devils have seduced upon the earth, bewildered. He has companions who invite him to guidance, [saying], 'Come to us.' Say, 'Indeed, the guidance of God - that is the [only] guidance, and He has commanded us to submit to the Lord of the worlds, and to establish prayer and fear Him - and it is to Him you will be gathered.' And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in truth. And on the Day He says, 'Be,' and it is - His is the word of truth. And His is the dominion on the Day the Trumpet is blown. He is the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed. And He is the Wise, the Acquainted.'"
6:74-79	"And remember when Abraham said to his father Azar, ""Do you take idols as gods? Indeed, I see you and your people in manifest error."" Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might be of the certain [in faith]. And when the night covered him, he saw a star. He said, ""This is my Lord."" But when it set, he said, ""I do not like those that set."" And when he saw the moon rising, he said, ""This is my Lord."" But when it set, he said, ""Unless my Lord guides me, I will surely be among the people gone astray."" And when he saw the sun rising, he said, ""This is my Lord. This is greater."" But when it set, he said, ""O my people, indeed I am disassociated from what you associate with God. Indeed, I have turned my face toward He who created the heavens and the earth, inclining toward truth, and I am not of those who associate others with God."""
6:80-83	"And he argued with his people. He said, ""Do you argue with me about Allah while He has guided me? And I do not fear what you associate with Him unless my Lord should will a thing? My Lord encompasses all things in knowledge. Then will you not remember? And how should I fear what you associate with Him while you do not fear that you have associated with Allah that for which He has not sent down to you authority? Then which of the two parties has more right to security, if you should know? Those who have believed and have not mixed their belief with injustice - those will have security, and they are [rightly] guided. And that was Our argument which We gave Abraham against his people. We raise by degrees whom We will. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing."""
6:84-90	"And We gave him Isaac and Jacob, each of them We guided, and Noah We guided before. And among his descendants were David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the doers of good. And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias, all were among the righteous. And Ishmael and Elisha and Jonah and Lot - each of them We preferred above the worlds. And from their fathers and their descendants and their brothers. And We chose them and guided them to a straight path. That is the guidance of Allah by which He guides whom He wills of His servants. And if they had associated others with Him, all that they used to do would have been in vain for them. Those are the ones to whom We have given the Scripture and wisdom and prophethood. But if these disbelieve in it - then We have entrusted it to a people who are not disbelievers in it. Those are the ones whom Allah has guided, so follow their guidance. Say, ""I do not ask of you any reward for it. It is not but a reminder to the worlds."""
6:91-92	They did not estimate God with His true estimate when they said, “God has not sent down anything to any human being.” Say, “Who sent down the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance for the people? You make it into sheets, some of which you show and much of which you conceal. And you have been taught that which you did not know, neither you nor your fathers.” Say, “God.” Then leave them in their false discourse, playing. And this is a blessed Book We have sent down, confirming what was before it, and that you may warn the Mother of Towns and those around it. And those who believe in the Hereafter believe in it, and they maintain their prayers.
6:93-94	"And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah or says, ""It has been revealed to me,"" while nothing has been revealed to him, and who says, ""I will send down the like of what Allah has revealed."" And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are in the overwhelming pangs of death while the angels are stretching forth their hands, ""Delivere [Allah's souls]! Today you will be recompensed with the punishment of humiliation for what you used to say about Allah other than the truth and were, toward His signs, arrogant."" And you have certainly come to Us alone, just as We created you the first time, and you have left behind your backs what We gave you. And We do not see with you your intercessors whom you claimed were partners among you. Relations between you have been severed, and lost from you is that which you used to claim."
6:95-99	Indeed, Allah is the Cleaver of the seed and the date stone. He brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living. That is Allah, so how are you deluded? He is the Cleaver of the dawn and made the night for rest and the sun and the moon for reckoning. That is the determination of the Almighty, the Knowing. And it is He who made for you the stars that you may be guided by them in the darknesses of the land and the sea. We have detailed the verses for a people who know. And it is He who produced you from a single soul, then a place of settlement and a place of storage. We have detailed the verses for a people who understand. And it is He who sent down water from the sky, and We produced thereby vegetation of all kinds, and We produced from it green produce, from which We bring forth grain arranged in layers. And from the palm trees, from their spathes, come clusters hanging low, and gardens of grapevines and olives and pomegranates, similar yet dissimilar. Look at its fruit when it bears fruit and ripens. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
6:100-105	"And they have attributed to Allah partners the jinn, although He created them, and they have fabricated for Him sons and daughters without knowledge. Glory be to Him, and He is far above what they describe. Originator of the heavens and the earth. How could He have a son when He has no wife? He created all things, and He is Knowing of all things. That is Allah, your Lord. There is no deity except Him, the Creator of all things, so worship Him. And He is Disposer of all things. Vision does not grasp Him, but He grasps all vision. He is the Subtle, the Acquainted. There have come to you clear insights from your Lord. So whoever sees, it is for his own soul, and whoever is blind, it is to his own detriment. And I am not a guardian over you. And thus do We diversify the verses that they may say, ""You have studied."" And We will make it clear to a people who know."
6:106-108	Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord - there is no god except Him - and turn away from those who associate others with God. And if God had willed, they would not have associated others with Him. And We have not made you a guardian over them, nor are you a disposer of affairs over them. And do not insult those they invoke other than God, lest they insult God in enmity without knowledge. Thus have We made pleasing to every nation their deeds. Then to their Lord is their return, and He will inform them about what they used to do.
6:109-111	"And they swear by God with their most solemn oaths that if a sign came to them, they would believe in it. Say, ""The signs are only with God. And what makes you perceive that when it comes, they will not believe?"" And We will turn away their hearts and their eyes, just as they did not believe in it the first time, and We will leave them wandering blindly in their transgression. And even if We sent down to them angels and the dead spoke to them and We gathered together before them all things in plain sight, they would not believe unless God willed, but most of them are ignorant."
6:112-113	And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy - devils from mankind and jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech in delusion. And if your Lord had willed, they would not have done it. So leave them and that which they invent and that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter will listen to it and be pleased with it and commit what they are committing.
6:114-117	Should I seek other than Allah as a judge while it is He who has revealed to you the Book detailed? And those to whom We gave the Scripture know that it is sent down from your Lord in truth, so never be among the doubters. And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and justice. None can change His words, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing. And if you obey most of those on the earth, they will mislead you from the way of Allah. They follow not except assumption, and they do not but guess. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who goes astray from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided.
6:118-121	So eat of that upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned, if you are believers in His verses. And what is [the matter] with you that you do not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has been mentioned while He has detailed to you what He has forbidden you, excepting that to which you are compelled? And indeed many mislead [others] by their [own] inclinations without knowledge. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of the transgressors. And abandon sin, both outward and inward. Indeed, those who earn sin will be recompensed for what they used to do. And do not eat of that upon which the name of Allah has not been mentioned, for indeed, it is grave disobedience. And indeed, the devils inspire their allies to dispute with you. And if you obey them, then indeed, you are polytheists.
6:122-124	"Or is he who was dead and We gave him life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people like one whose example is in darkness, never to emerge from it? Thus is made attractive to the disbelievers that which they have been doing. And thus We have appointed in every city the greatest of its criminals that they may plot therein. But they plot not except against themselves and perceive [it] not. And when a sign comes to them, they say, ""We will not believe until we are given the like of that which was given to the messengers of Allah."" Allah knows best with whom He places His message. Those who commit crimes will soon be struck by humiliation before Allah and a severe punishment for what they have been plotting."
6:125-127	So whomever Allah intends to guide, He expands his breast to [contain] Islam. And whomever He intends to misguide, He makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky. Thus does Allah place defilement upon those who do not believe. And this is the straight path of your Lord. We have detailed the verses for a people who remember. For them is the home of peace with their Lord, and He is their Protector for what they used to do.
6:128-131	"And the Day He will gather them all together, ""O company of jinn, you have taken too much advantage of mankind."" And their allies among mankind will say, ""Our Lord, some of us enjoyed one another, and we have reached our term which You appointed for us."" He will say, ""The Fire will be your residence, wherein you will abide eternally, except for what Allah wills. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing."" And thus do We let some of the wrongdoers have dominion over others because of what they used to earn. ""O company of jinn and mankind, did there not come to you messengers from among you, relating to you My verses and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?"" They will say, ""We bear witness against ourselves,"" and the worldly life deluded them. And they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers. That is because your Lord would not destroy the cities unjustly while their people were heedless."
6:132-135	"And for all are degrees according to what they have done. And your Lord is not unaware of what they do. And your Lord is the Free of need, the Possessor of mercy. If He wills, He can do away with you and replace you with whomever He wills, just as He produced you from the descendants of another people. Indeed, that which you are promised is coming, and you will not escape. Say, ""O my people, work according to your position. Indeed, I am working. And you will soon know who will have the final home. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed."""
6:136-137	"And they have assigned to Allah a portion of what He has created of tilth and livestock, saying, ""This is for Allah,"" according to their claim, and ""this is for our associates."" But whatever is for their associates does not reach Allah, and whatever is for Allah reaches their associates. Evil is that which they judge. And thus their associates have made attractive to many of the polytheists the killing of their children, that they may lead them astray and confuse them with their religion. And if Allah had willed, they would not have done it. So leave them and that which they invent."
6:138-140	"And they say, ""These are cattle and fields which are forbidden; none shall eat them except whom We will,"" according to their claim. And cattle whose backs are forbidden, and cattle over which they do not mention the name of Allah, inventing a lie against Him. He will recompense them for what they used to invent. And they say, ""What is in the bellies of these cattle is exclusively for our males and forbidden to our wives, but if it should be dead, then they will share in it."" He will recompense them for their description. Indeed, He is Wise and Knowing. Indeed, they have lost who killed their children foolishly without knowledge and forbade what Allah has provided for them, inventing a lie against Allah. They have gone astray and were not [rightly] guided."
6:141-142	And it is He who produced gardens, trellised and untrellised, and palm trees and crops of varying taste, and olives and pomegranates, some similar and some dissimilar. Eat of its fruit when it bears fruit and give its due on the day of its harvest, and be not excessive. Indeed, He does not like those who commit excess. And of the grazing livestock are burdens and beds. Eat of what Allah has provided for you and do not follow the footsteps of Satan. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy.
6:143-144	"Eight pairs of sheep, two, and of goats, two. Say, ""Have He forbidden the two males, or the two females? Or what the wombs of the two females contain? Inform Me with knowledge, if you should be truthful."" And of camels, two, and of cattle, two. Say, ""Have He forbidden the two males, or the two females? Or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when Allah enjoined this upon you?"" Then who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah to lead people astray without knowledge? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people."
6:145-147	"Say, ""I do not find within what has been revealed to me anything forbidden to one who would eat it unless it be dead animals, or blood poured forth, or the flesh of swine - for indeed, it is impure - or an abomination dedicated to other than God. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limits] - then indeed, your Lord is Forgiving and Merciful. And We prohibited to those who were Jews every animal with claws, and of the cattle and the sheep We prohibited to them their fat, except what adhered to their backs or the entrails or what was mixed with a bone. That is We recompensed them for their transgression, and indeed, We are truthful."" But if they deny you, then say, ""Your Lord is full of mercy, and His punishment is not averted from the criminal people."""
6:148-150	"Those who associate others with God will say, ""If God had willed, we would not have associated [others], nor would our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything."" Thus did those before them deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, ""Have you any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but guessing."" Say, ""Then God has the conclusive argument. If He had willed, He could have guided you all."" Say, ""Bring your witnesses who testify that God has forbidden this."" But if they testify, do not testify with them and do not follow the inclinations of those who deny Our verses and those who do not believe in the Hereafter and set equals with their Lord."
6:151-153	"Say, ""Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited to you: Do not associate anything with Him, and to parents, good treatment. And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will provide for you and for them. And do not approach immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right. This He has enjoined upon you that you may understand. And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in a way that is best, until he reaches maturity. And give full measure and weight in justice. We charge no soul except [with that within] its capacity. And when you speak, be just, even if it concerns a relative. And fulfill the covenant of Allah. This He has enjoined upon you that you may remember. And [O Muhammad], this is My path, which is straight, so follow it, and do not follow [other] paths, for they will separate you from His path. This He has enjoined upon you that you may become righteous."""
6:154-158	"Then We gave Moses the Scripture, perfecting for him who does good and detailing all things and a guidance and a mercy that they may believe in the meeting with their Lord. And this is a Book We have sent down as a blessing, so follow it and fear Allah that you may receive mercy. Lest you say, ""The Scripture was only sent down to two groups before us, and we were, of their study, unaware."" Or that you say, ""If only the Scripture had been sent down to us, we would have been better guided than they."" But there has come to you clear evidence from your Lord and guidance and mercy. So who is more unjust than he who denies the verses of Allah and turns away from them? We will recompense those who turn away from Our verses with an evil punishment for what they used to turn away. Do they await anything but that the angels should come to them or your Lord should come or some of the signs of your Lord should come? The Day some of the signs of your Lord come, no soul will benefit from its faith if it did not believe before or earned good through its faith. Say, ""Wait; we are waiting."""
6:159-160	Indeed, those who have divided their religion and become sects - you are not of them in anything. Their affair is only with Allah. Then He will inform them about what they used to do. Whoever brings a good deed will have ten times the like thereof, and whoever brings an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof, and they will not be wronged.
6:161-163	"Say, ""Indeed, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who associate others with God."" Say, ""Indeed, my prayer, my sacrifice, my life, and my death are for God, Lord of the worlds. He has no partner. And this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims."""
6:164-165	"Say, ""Shall I seek other than God as a lord while He is the Lord of all things? And no soul earns except against itself, and no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you concerning that over which you used to differ. And it is He who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees that He may test you through what He has given you. Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful."""
7:1-3	The Book has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], so let not your breast feel any discomfort therefrom, that you may warn thereby and as a reminder to the believers. Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow other protectors besides Him. Little do you remember.
7:4-7	"And how many a town have We destroyed, and Our punishment came to it by night or while they were asleep. But their only prayer when Our punishment came to them was that they said, ""Indeed, we were wrongdoers."" So We will surely question those to whom messages were sent, and We will surely question the messengers. And We will narrate to them with knowledge. And We were not absent."
7:8-10	And the weighing on that Day will be true. So those whose scales are heavy - it is those who will be the successful. And those whose scales are light - it is those who will lose themselves because they used to wrong Our verses. And We have established you in the land and provided for you therein means of livelihood. Little do you give thanks.
7:11-18	"And We had certainly created you, then formed you, then said to the angels, ""Prostrate to Adam,"" and they prostrated, except for Iblis. He was not of those who prostrated. He said, ""What prevented you from prostrating when I commanded you?"" He said, ""I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay."" He said, ""Then get down from it, for it is not for you to be arrogant therein. So get out, for you are of the debased."" He said, ""Reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected."" He said, ""Indeed, you are of those reprieved."" He said, ""Then because you have put me in error, I will surely sit in wait for them on Your straight path. Then I will come to them from before them and behind them and on their right and on their left, and You will not find most of them grateful."" He said, ""Get out of it, disgraced and expelled. Whoever of them follows you - I will surely fill Hell with you, all of you."""
7:19-25	"And O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise and eat from wherever you will, but do not approach this tree, lest you be among the wrongdoers. But Satan whispered to them, that he might make apparent to them that which was concealed from them of their private parts, and said, ""Your Lord did not forbid you from this tree except that you should become angels or become of the immortals."" And he swore to them, ""Indeed, I am to you one of the sincere advisers."" But he led them astray by deception. But when they tasted of the tree, their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And their Lord called to them, ""Did I not forbid you from that tree and tell you that Satan is to you a clear enemy?"" They said, ""Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers."" He said, ""Go down, some of you an enemy to one another. And you will have upon the earth a settlement and provision for a time."" He said, ""Therein you will live, and therein you will die, and from it you will be brought forth."""
7:26-27	O children of Adam, We have bestowed upon you clothing to conceal your private parts and adornment. But the clothing of righteousness - that is best. That is from the signs of Allah that perhaps they will be reminded. O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe.
7:28-30	"And when they commit an immorality, they say, ""We found our fathers doing it, and God has commanded us to do it."" Say, ""Indeed, God does not command immorality. Do you say about God that which you do not know?"" Say, ""My Lord has commanded justice. And direct your faces toward every masjid and call upon Him, sincere to Him in religion. Just as He began you, you will return."" A party He has guided, and a party upon whom error is justly decreed. Indeed, they have taken the devils as allies instead of God and think that they are guided."
7:31-34	"O children of Adam, take your adornment at every masjid, and eat and drink, but be not excessive. Indeed, He does not like those who commit excess. Say, ""Who has forbidden the adornment of Allah which He has produced for His servants and the good things of provision?"" Say, ""They are for those who believe in worldly life and exclusively for the Day of Resurrection."" Thus do We detail the verses for a people who know. Say, ""My Lord has only forbidden immoralities - what is apparent of them and what is concealed - and sin, and oppression without right, and that you associate with Allah that for which He has not sent down authority, and that you say about Allah that which you do not know. And every nation is appointed a term; so when their term comes, they will not remain behind an hour, nor will they precede it."""
7:35-37	"O children of Adam, if there come to you messengers from among you relating to you My verses - then whoever fears Allah and reforms - no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve. But those who deny Our verses and are arrogant toward them - those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. So who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah or denies His verses? Those will receive their portion of the Book until, when Our messengers come to them, taking them in death, they will say, ""Where were those you used to invoke besides Allah?"" They will say, ""They have gone astray from Us,"" and they will bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers."
7:38-41	"He said, ""Enter among nations that have passed on before you of jinn and men into the Fire. Every time a nation enters, it curses its sister until, when they have all overtaken therein, the last of them will say to the first of them, ""Our Lord, these misled us, so give them a double punishment in the Fire."" He will say to each double, but you do not know. And the first of them will say to the last of them, ""You had no superiority over us, so taste the punishment for what you used to earn."" Indeed, those who deny Our verses and are arrogant toward them - the gates of heaven will not be opened for them, nor will they enter Paradise until a camel passes through the eye of a needle. Thus do We recompense the criminals. For them is a bed of Hell, and above them are coverings. And thus do We recompense the wrongdoers."
7:42-43	"And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - We charge no soul except [with that within] its capacity. Those are the companions of Paradise, wherein they will abide eternally. And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment; beneath them rivers flow, and they will say, ""Praise be to God, who has guided us to this."" And we would not have been guided had God not guided us. The messengers of our Lord had certainly brought the truth. And they will be called, ""This is Paradise which you have inherited because of what you used to do."""
7:44-45	"And the companions of Paradise will call out to the companions of the Fire, ""We have found what our Lord promised us to be true. Have you found what your Lord promised to be true?"" They will say, ""Yes."" Then a crier will proclaim among them, ""The curse of God is upon the wrongdoers - those who avert [people] from the way of God and seek to make it crooked while they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers."""
7:46-49	"And between them is a veil, and on the heights are men who know all by their mark. And they will call to the companions of Paradise, ""Peace be upon you."" They will not enter it, while they were yearning. But when their eyes are turned toward the companions of the Fire, they will say, ""Our Lord, do not place us with the wrongdoing people."" And the companions of the heights will call to men whom they recognize by their mark, ""Your multitude and your being arrogant did not avail you. Are these the ones about whom you swore that Allah would not extend mercy? Enter Paradise; no fear will there be concerning you, nor will you grieve."
7:50-51	"And the companions of the Fire will call out to the companions of Paradise, ""Pour upon us some water or from whatever Allah has provided you."" They will say, ""Indeed, Allah has forbidden both of them to the disbelievers - [who] took their religion as amusement and diversion, and whom the worldly life deluded. So this Day We will forget them as they forgot the meeting with this Day of theirs, and they used to deny Our verses."""
7:52-53	"And We have certainly brought them a Book which We have detailed with knowledge, as guidance and mercy for a people who believe. Do they await aught but its interpretation? The Day its interpretation comes, those who had forgotten it before will say, ""The messengers of our Lord had already come with the truth. So are there for us any intercessors who will intercede for us, or can we be sent back so we can do other than what we used to do?"" They have lost themselves, and lost from them is that which they used to invent."
7:54-56	Your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then established Himself on the Throne. He covers the night with the day, pursuing it rapidly. And the sun, the moon, and the stars are subjected by His command. Unquestionably, His is the creation and the command. Blessed be Allah, Lord of the worlds. Call upon your Lord in humility and in secret. Indeed, He does not like transgressors. And do not cause corruption on the earth after its reformation, and call upon Him in fear and hope. Indeed, the mercy of Allah is near to the doers of good.
7:57-58	And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy. Until, when they carry heavy clouds, We drive them to a dead land and send down water therein and bring forth thereby all kinds of fruits. Thus do We bring forth the dead that you may remember. And the good land - its vegetation emerges by permission of its Lord, but that which is bad emerges only with difficulty. Thus do We diversify the signs for a people who are grateful.
7:59-64	"We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, ""O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day."" The eminent among his people said, ""Indeed, we see you in manifest error."" He said, ""O my people, there is no error in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. I convey to you the messages of my Lord and advise you, and I know from Allah that which you do not know. Or do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your Lord through a man from among you, that he may warn you and that you may fear Allah and that you may receive mercy?"" But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and We drowned those who denied Our signs. Indeed, they were a blind people."
7:65-72	"And to Aad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said, ""O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Will you not then fear Allah?"" The eminent ones who disbelieved among his people said, ""Indeed, we see you in foolishness, and indeed, we think you are of the liars."" He said, ""O my people, there is no foolishness in me, but I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. I convey to you the messages of my Lord, and indeed, I am to you a trustworthy adviser. Do you wonder that a message has come to you from your Lord through a man from among you to warn you? And remember when He made you successors after the people of Noah and increased you in abundance in creation. So remember the favors of Allah that you may be successful."" They said, ""Have you come to us so that we may worship Allah alone and abandon what our fathers used to worship? Then bring upon us what you promise us, if you should be of the truthful."" He said, ""Indeed, there has fallen upon you from your Lord defilement and wrath. Do you dispute with me over names you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority? Then wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait."" So We saved him and those with him by mercy from Us, and We eliminated the root of those who denied Our verses, and they were not believers."
7:73-79	"And to Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said, ""O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord. This is the she-camel of Allah as a sign for you, so leave her to graze in the land of Allah and do not touch her with harm, lest a painful punishment seize you. And remember when He made you successors after 'Aad and settled you in the land, you taking for yourself palaces from its plains and carving out homes in the mountains. So remember the favors of Allah and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption."" The eminent ones who were arrogant among his people said to those who were deemed weak among them who believed, ""Do you know that Salih is a messenger from his Lord?"" They said, ""Indeed, we are believers in that with which he has been sent."" Those who were arrogant said, ""Indeed, we are disbelievers in that in which you have believed."" So they hamstrung the she-camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord and said, ""O Salih, bring us what you threaten us with, if you should be of the messengers."" So the earthquake seized them, and they became within their home fallen down. But he turned away from them and said, ""O my people, I have indeed conveyed to you the message of my Lord and given you sincere advice, but you do not like sincere advisers."""
7:80-84	"And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, ""Do you commit such immorality as no one has ever done before you among the worlds? Indeed, you approach men with desire instead of women. Rather, you are a transgressing people."" And the answer of his people was only that they said, ""Drive them out of your city. Indeed, they are people who keep themselves pure."" So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; she was among those who remained behind. And We rained down upon them a rain. Then see how was the end of the criminals."
7:85-93	"And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu`ayb. He said, ""O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. There has come to you clear evidence from your Lord, so give full measure and weight and do not deprive people of their due rights and do not cause corruption on the earth after its reformation. That is best for you, if you should be believers. And do not sit on every path, threatening and averting from the way of Allah those who believe in Him, seeking to make it crooked. And remember when you were few and He made you many, and see what was the end of those who corrupted. And if a party among you believes in that with which I have been sent and a party does not believe, then be patient until Allah judges between us. And He is the best of judges."" The eminent ones among his people who were arrogant said, ""We will surely expel you, Shu`ayb, and those who have believed with you from our city, or you must return to our religion."" He said, ""Even if we were averse?"" We would have certainly invented a lie against Allah if we returned to your religion after Allah has saved us from it. And it is not for us to return to it unless Allah wills. Our Lord! Our Lord encompasses all things in knowledge. In Allah we have relied. Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth, for You are the best of judges. And the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people said, ""If you follow Shu`ayb, indeed, you will be losers."" So the earthquake seized them, and they became within their homes fallen down. Those who denied Shu`ayb - it was as if they had never prospered therein. Those who denied Shu`ayb - they were the losers. But he turned away from them and said, ""O my people, I have indeed conveyed to you the messages of my Lord and given you good advice. So how can I grieve for a disbelieving people?"""
7:94-95	"And We did not send to any city a prophet except that We seized its people with poverty and hardship that perhaps they would humble themselves. Then We substituted good for evil until they repented and said, ""Indeed, our fathers were touched by hardship and prosperity."" Then We seized them suddenly while they did not perceive."
7:96-102	And if only the people of the towns had believed and feared Allah, We should have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and the earth. But they denied, so We seized them for what they used to earn. Have the people of the towns felt secure that Our punishment would not come to them at night while they were asleep? Have the people of the towns felt secure that Our punishment would not come to them at noon while they were playing? Have they felt secure from the plan of Allah? But none feels secure from the plan of Allah except the losing people. Have it not been shown to those who inherit the earth after its people that, if We willed, We could afflict them for their sins and seal their hearts so they would not hear? These towns - We relate to you, [O Muhammad], of their news. And there had already come to them Their messengers with clear proofs, but they were not to believe in what they denied before. Thus does Allah set a seal upon the hearts of the disbelievers. And We found for most of them no covenant, and indeed We found most of them to be wicked.
7:103-108	"Then after them We sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they wronged them. So see how was the end of the corrupters. And Moses said, ""O Pharaoh, indeed I am a messenger from the Lord of the worlds. It is incumbent upon me not to say about Allah except the truth. I have come to you with clear evidence from your Lord, so send with me the Children of Israel."" He said, ""If you have come with a sign, then produce it, if you should be of the truthful."" So he threw down his staff, and behold, it was a clear serpent. And he withdrew his hand, and behold, it was white to the observers."
7:109-112	"The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, ""Indeed, this is a skilled magician. He wants to expel you from your land. So what do you advise?"" They said, ""Put him and his brother off, and send gatherers into the cities. They will bring you every skilled magician."""
7:113-126	"And the magicians came to Pharaoh. They said, ""Surely we will have a reward if we are the victors."" He said, ""Yes, and indeed, you will be among those brought near."" They said, ""O Moses, either you throw or we will be the ones who throw."" He said, ""Throw."" And when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them and produced a great magic. And We inspired Moses, ""Throw down your staff,"" and at once it devoured what they were fabricating. So the truth occurred, and nullified what they were doing. So they were defeated there, and they turned back in humiliation. And the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, ""We have believed in the Lord of the worlds - the Lord of Moses and Aaron."" Pharaoh said, ""You have believed in him before I gave you permission. Indeed, this is a plot you have plotted in the city to expel from it its people, and you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides; then I will crucify you all."" They said, ""Indeed, to our Lord we will return. And you do not resent us except that we believed in the signs of our Lord when they came to us. Our Lord, pour upon us patience and take us in death as Muslims."""
7:127-129	"The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said, ""Will you leave Moses and his people to cause corruption in the land and abandon you and your gods?"" He said, ""We will surely kill their sons and spare their women, and indeed, we are over them dominant."" Moses said to his people, ""Seek help from Allah and be patient. Indeed, the earth belongs to Allah. He causes it to inherit whom He wills of His servants. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous."" They said, ""We were harmed before you came to us and after you came to us."" He said, ""Perhaps your Lord will destroy your enemy and make you successors in the land and see how you act."""
7:130-136	"And We seized the people of Pharaoh with years of drought and loss of fruits that perhaps they would remember. But when good came to them, they said, ""This is ours""; but when evil befell them, they ascribed an evil omen to Moses and those with him. Unquestionably, their evil omen is only with Allah, but most of them do not know. And they said, ""No matter what sign you bring us to bewitch us with, we will not believe in you."" So We sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the lice and the frogs and the blood as distinct signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people. And when the punishment fell upon them, they said, ""O Moses, call upon your Lord for us according to what He has promised you. If you remove the punishment from us, we will surely believe in you, and we will send with you the Children of Israel."" But when We removed the punishment from them for a term they were to reach, at once they broke their promise. So We took retribution from them and drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them."
7:137-137	And We caused the people who were oppressed to inherit the eastern and western regions of the land which We had blessed. And the good word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of their patience. And We destroyed what Pharaoh and his people had made and what they had built.
7:138-140	"And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and they came upon a people devoted to their idols. They said, ""O Moses, make for us a god as they have gods."" He said, ""Indeed, you are a people behaving ignorantly. Indeed, what these people are doing is ruined, and what they have been doing is futile."" He said, ""Shall I seek for you a god other than God while He has favored you over the worlds?"""
7:141-141	And when We delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst of torment, killing your sons and sparing your women. And in that was a great trial from your Lord.
7:142-143	"And We appointed for Moses thirty nights, and completed them with ten, so the term of his Lord was completed as forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron, ""Take my place among my people, and do right, and follow not the way of the corrupters."" And when Moses came to Our appointed time, and his Lord spoke to him, he said, ""My Lord, show me [yourself], that I may look at You."" He said, ""You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it remains in its place, then you will see Me."" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. But when he regained consciousness, he said, ""Glory be to You! I repent to You, and I am the first of the believers."""
7:144-145	"He said, ""O Moses, indeed I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My speech, so take what I have given you and be among the grateful."" And We wrote for him on the tablets of all things an admonition and a detailed explanation of all things, so take it with determination and enjoin upon your people the best of it. I will show you the home of the wicked."
7:146-147	I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right. And if they see every sign, they will not believe in it. And if they see the path of right guidance, they will not take it as a path, and if they see the path of error, they will take it as a path. That is because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them. And those who deny Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter - their deeds have become worthless. Are they recompensed except for what they used to do?
7:148-149	"And the people of Moses took after him from their ornaments a calf, a body that lowed. Did they not see that it did not speak to them, nor guide them to a way? They took it, and they were wrongdoers. And when it fell into their hands and they saw that they had gone astray, they said, ""If our Lord does not have mercy on us and forgive us, we will surely be among the losers."""
7:150-153	"And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, ""Evil is that which you have left me after me! Did you hasten the command of your Lord?"" And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by the head, dragging him toward him. He said, ""Son of my mother, indeed the people oppressed me and were about to kill me. So let not the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me with the wrongdoing people."" He said, ""My Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the Most Merciful of the merciful."" Indeed, those who took the calf - upon them will be overtaken by wrath from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world. Thus do We recompense the slanderers. But as for those who committed evil deeds and then repented thereafter and believed - indeed, your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful."
7:154-156	"And when Moses' anger subsided, he took up the tablets; and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who fear their Lord. And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointed time. But when the earthquake seized them, he said, ""My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed them and me before. Will You destroy us for what the fools among us have done? It is not but Your trial by which You send astray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Protector, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, for You are the best of forgivers. And decree for us in this world [that which is] good and in the Hereafter. Indeed, we have turned [back] to You."" He said, ""My punishment - I afflict with it whom I will, but My mercy encompasses all things, so I will decree it for those who fear Me and give zakah and those who believe in Our verses."""
7:157-158	"Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel. He enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them. So those who believe in him, honor him, support him, and follow the light which has been sent down with him - those are the successful. Say, ""O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of Allah to you all, to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no deity except Him. He gives life and causes death. So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him that you may be guided."""
7:159-162	"And among the people of Moses was a community guiding with the truth and doing justice thereby. And We divided them into twelve tribes, nations. And We inspired Moses when his people asked him for water, ""Strike the rock with your staff,"" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs. Every people knew their drinking place. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails, ""Eat from the good things We have provided for you."" They did not wrong Us, but they were wronging themselves. And when it was said to them, ""Dwell in this city and eat from it wherever you wish and say, 'Forgiveness,' and enter the gate bowing down. We will forgive you your sins. We will increase the doers of good."" But those who did wrong among them substituted another statement other than that which was said to them, so We sent upon them a punishment from the sky because they were wronging."
7:163-163	And ask them about the town that was by the sea, when they transgressed the Sabbath, when their fish came to them on their Sabbath day lawfully, but on the day they did not observe the Sabbath, they did not come to them. Thus did We test them for what they were defiantly doing.
7:164-166	"And when a group of them said, ""Why do you preach to a people whom God is about to destroy or punish with a severe punishment?"" They said, ""An excuse before your Lord, and perhaps they will fear God."" But when they forgot that by which they had been reminded, We saved those who had forbidden evil, and We seized those who did wrong with a wretched punishment because they used to commit wickedness. But when they rebelled against that which they had been forbidden, We said to them, ""Be apes, despised."""
7:167-171	And [mention] when your Lord proclaimed that He would surely send against them until the Day of Resurrection those who would afflict them with the worst of punishment. Indeed, your Lord is swift in penalty; but indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful. And We divided them throughout the earth into nations, among them were the righteous and among them were less than that. And We tested them with good and evil that perhaps they would return. Then there came after them an evil generation who inherited the Scripture, taking the goods of this lower world and saying, “We will be forgiven.” But if a similar goods came to them, they would take it. Was not a covenant taken from them of the Scripture that they would not say about Allah except the truth? And they studied what was in it. And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who fear Allah. Then will you not reason? And [mention] those who hold fast to the Scripture and establish prayer - indeed, We do not allow to be lost the reward of the reformers. And [mention] when We made the mountain rise above them as if it were a canopy and they thought it was falling upon them, [saying], “Take what We have given you with strength and remember what is in it that you may fear Allah.”
7:172-174	"And [mention] when your Lord took from the children of Adam - from their loins - their descendants and made them testify of themselves, [saying], ""Am I not your Lord?"" They said, ""Yes, we testify."" - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection, ""Indeed, we were of this unaware."" Or you should say, ""Indeed, our fathers associated others with Allah before, and we were descendants after them. Will You then destroy us for what the falsifiers have done?"" And thus do We detail the verses that perhaps they will return."
7:175-178	And recite to them the news of the one to whom We gave Our signs, but he slipped out of them. So Satan pursued him, and he became of the deviators. And if We had willed, We could have elevated him thereby, but he clung to the earth and followed his own desire. So his example is that of the dog: if you chase him, he pants, or if you leave him, he pants, that is the example of the people who deny Our signs. So relate the story that perhaps they will give thought. Evil is the example of the people who deny Our signs and were wronging themselves. He whom Allah guides - he is the guided one, and he whom He sends astray - it is those who are the losers.
7:179-179	And We have certainly created for Hell many of the jinn and mankind. They have hearts with which they do not understand, they have eyes with which they do not see, and they have ears with which they do not hear. Those are like livestock, rather, they are more astray. It is those who are the heedless.
7:180-180	To God belong the best names, so invoke Him by them and leave those who deviate concerning His names. They will be recompensed for what they used to do.
7:181-186	And among those We have created is a nation who guide with the truth and establish justice thereby. And those who deny Our verses - We will gradually lead them on from where they do not know. And I will grant them respite. Indeed, My plan is firm. Have they not considered? There is no madness in their companion. He is only a clear warner. Have they not considered the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all things Allah has created and that perhaps their term has drawn near. So in what statement after that will they believe? He whom Allah sends astray - there is no guide for him. And He leaves them wandering blindly in their transgression.
7:187-187	"They ask you about the Hour: when will it come? Say, ""The knowledge thereof is only with my Lord. None can reveal its time except Him. It is heavy upon the heavens and the earth. It will not come upon you except suddenly."" They ask you as if you were anxious about it. Say, ""The knowledge thereof is only with God, but most people do not know."""
7:188-188	"Say, ""I do not possess for myself any benefit or harm except what God wills. And if I knew the unseen, I could have increased in good, and no harm would have touched me. I am only a warner and a bringer of good tidings to a people who believe."""
7:189-195	"It is He who created you from one soul and created from it its mate that he might dwell in security with her. But when he covered her, she carried a light burden and passed through it. But when she became heavy, they both cried out to Allah, their Lord, ""If You should give us a good [child], we will surely be among the grateful."" But when He gave them both a good [child], they attributed to Him partners in what He has given them. So exalted is Allah above what they associate with Him. Do they associate with Him that which does not create anything and is created? And they are not able to help them, nor can they help themselves. And if you invite them to guidance, they will not follow you - it is all the same for you whether you invite them or are silent. Indeed, those you invoke besides Allah are servants like you, so invoke them and let them respond to you, if you should be truthful. Do they have feet by which they walk, or do they have hands by which they strike, or do they have eyes by which they see, or do they have ears by which they hear? Say, ""Call upon your partners; then plot, and you will not be given respite."""
7:196-198	Indeed, my ally is Allah, who has revealed the Book, and He is the ally of the righteous. And those whom you invoke besides Him cannot help you, nor can they help themselves. And if you call them to guidance, they do not hear, and you will see them looking at you, but they do not see.
7:199-203	"Accept forgiveness, enjoin what is right, and turn away from the ignorant. But if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing. Indeed, those who fear Allah - when an impulse touches them from Satan, they remember [Allah] and at once they have insight. But their brothers extend them in error and then they do not stop short. And when you do not bring them a sign, they say, ""Why did you not choose it?"" Say, ""I only follow what is revealed to me from my Lord. These are insights from your Lord and guidance and mercy for a people who believe."""
7:204-206	And when the Qur'an is recited, listen to it and be silent that you may receive mercy. And remember your Lord within yourself in humility and fear and without being loud in speech in the mornings and the evenings, and do not be among the heedless. Indeed, those who are with your Lord are not too proud to worship Him, and they exalt Him and to Him they prostrate.
8:1-4	"They ask you, [O Muhammad], about the spoils of war. Say, ""The spoils belong to Allah and the Messenger. So fear Allah and amend that which is between you and obey Allah and His Messenger, if you are [true] believers. The believers are only those who, when Allah is mentioned, their hearts become fearful, and when His verses are recited to them, it increases them in faith; and upon their Lord they rely. Who establish prayer and spend out of what We have provided for them. Those are the believers, truly. For them are degrees of status with their Lord and forgiveness and noble provision."
8:5-8	As your Lord brought you out from your home with truth, although a party of the believers were averse. They dispute with you concerning the truth after it had become clear as if they were being driven to death while they were looking on. And when God promised you one of the two parties that it would be yours, and you wished that the one without power would be yours. And God intended to establish the truth with His words and to eliminate the disbelievers - that He might establish the truth and abolish falsehood, even though the criminals hate it.
8:9-14	"When you called upon your Lord, and He responded to you, ""I will reinforce you with a thousand angels, following one another."" And Allah did not make it except as good tidings and that your hearts might be reassured thereby. And victory is not but from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. When He covered you with drowsiness as a security from Him and sent down upon you from the sky water to purify you thereby and remove from you the defilement of Satan and to strengthen your hearts and plant firmly thereby your feet. When your Lord inspired to the angels, ""I am with you, so strengthen those who have believed. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieved, so strike [them] upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip."" That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger. And whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger - then indeed, Allah is severe in penalty. So taste it, and indeed, for the disbelievers is the punishment of the Fire."
8:15-16	O you who have believed, when you meet those who disbelieve advancing [against the enemy], do not turn to them your backs. And whoever turns his back to them that day, unless turning aside for battle or withdrawing to a company, has certainly drawn upon himself wrath from Allah, and his refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.
8:17-19	So you did not kill them, but Allah killed them. And you did not throw when you threw, but Allah threw that He might test the believers with a good test. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing. That is so, and indeed, Allah weakens the plot of the disbelievers. If you ask for victory, victory has already come to you. But if you desist, it is better for you. But if you return [to battle], We will return [to battle]. And your company will not avail you at all, even if it were large. And indeed, Allah is with the believers.
8:20-26	"O you who have believed, obey Allah and His Messenger and do not turn away from him while you hear. And do not be like those who say, ""We hear,"" and they do not hear. Indeed, the worst of living creatures in the sight of Allah are the deaf and dumb who do not use reason. And if Allah had known any good in them, He would have made them hear; and if He had made them hear, they would have turned away while they are averse. O you who have believed, respond to Allah and the Messenger when he calls you to that which gives you life. And know that Allah intervenes between a man and his heart and that to Him you will be gathered. And fear a trial which will not strike those who have wronged among you exclusively. And know that Allah is severe in penalty. And remember when you were few and oppressed in the land, fearing that people would abduct you, but He gave you shelter and supported you with His victory and provided for you of the good things that you might be grateful."
8:27-29	O you who have believed, do not betray Allah and the Messenger or betray your trusts while you know. And know that your possessions and your children are but a trial and that Allah has with Him a great reward. O you who have believed, if you fear Allah, He will grant you a criterion and will remove from you your misdeeds and forgive you. And Allah is the possessor of great bounty.
8:30-37	"And when those who disbelieved plotted against you to imprison you or kill you or expel you - and they plotted, and Allah plotted - and Allah is the best of plotters. And when Our verses are recited to them, they say, ""We have heard. If we willed, we could say the like of this. This is not but legends of the former peoples."" And when they said, ""O Allah, if this is the truth from You, then rain down upon us stones from the sky or bring us a painful punishment."" And Allah would not punish them while you are among them, nor would Allah punish them while they seek forgiveness. And why should Allah not punish them while they hinder [people] from al-Masjid al-Haram? And they were not its guardians. Its guardians are only the righteous, but most of them do not know. And their prayer at the House was nothing but whistling and clapping of hands. So taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve. Indeed, those who disbelieve spend their wealth to avert [people] from the way of Allah. So they will spend it; then it will be for them a cause of regret; then they will be overcome. And those who disbelieved will be gathered to Hell - that Allah may distinguish the wicked from the good and put the wicked one upon another and heap them all together and put them in Hell. Those are the losers."
8:38-40	"Say to those who disbelieve, ""If they cease, what has previously occurred will be forgiven them; but if they return [to disbelief], then the precedent of the former peoples has already passed."" And fight them until there is no more fitnah and religion is all for Allah. But if they cease, then indeed, Allah, of what they do, is Seeing. But if they turn away, then know that Allah is your Protector - an excellent Protector and an excellent Helper."
8:41-41	Know that whatever you gain, a fifth of it is for Allah and for the Messenger and for the near relatives and the orphans and the needy and the traveler, if you have believed in Allah and in what We revealed to Our Servant on the Day of Criterion, the day the two armies met. And Allah is over all things competent.
8:42-44	When you were on the nearer slope, and they were on the farther slope, and the caravan was below you. And if you had made an appointment, you would have differed concerning the appointment; but [it was] so that Allah might accomplish a matter [already] destined - that he who was to perish would perish by clear evidence, and he who was to live would live by clear evidence. And indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing. When Allah showed them to you in your dream as few. And had He shown them to you as many, you would have lost heart, and you would have disputed over the matter, but Allah saved. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts. And when He showed them to you, when you met, as few in your eyes and made you as few in their eyes - that Allah might accomplish a matter [already] destined. And to Allah are returned all matters.
8:45-49	"O you who have believed, when you meet an army, stand firm and remember Allah much that you may be successful. And obey Allah and His Messenger and do not dispute and [thus] lose courage and your strength departs, and be patient. Indeed, Allah is with the patient. And be not like those who went forth from their homes insolently and to be seen by people and avert [people] from the way of Allah. And Allah encompasses what they do. And [mention] when Satan made their deeds pleasing to them and said, ""No one from among the people can overcome you this day, and indeed, I am your protector."" But when the two companies came in sight of each other, he turned on his heels and said, ""Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I see what you do not see. Indeed, I fear Allah. And Allah is severe in penalty."" When the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said, ""Their religion has deluded these."" And whoever relies upon Allah - then indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise."
8:50-51	And if you could but see when the angels take the souls of those who disbelieved - they strike their faces and their backs, [saying], “Taste the punishment of the Burning Fire.” That is for what your hands have put forth, and because Allah is not unjust to His servants.
8:52-54	Like the way of the people of Pharaoh and those before them, they disbelieved in the signs of Allah, so Allah seized them for their sins. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and severe in penalty. That is because Allah would not change a favor which He had bestowed upon a people until they change what is in themselves. And indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing. Like the way of the people of Pharaoh and those before them, they denied the signs of their Lord, so We destroyed them for their sins and drowned the people of Pharaoh. And all of them were wrongdoers.
8:55-61	Indeed, the worst of beasts in the sight of Allah are those who disbelieve - for they will not believe. [They are] those among them with whom you made a treaty but then break their treaty every time, and they do not fear Allah. So if you overtake them in war, disperse by them those behind them that perhaps they will be reminded. But if you fear treachery from a people, throw back to them upon equal terms. Indeed, Allah does not like traitors. And let not those who disbelieve think that they will outpace them. Indeed, they will not escape. And prepare against them whatever you are able of power and of steeds of war by which you may terrify the enemy of Allah and your enemy and others besides them whom you do not know - Allah knows them. And whatever you spend in the cause of Allah - it will be fully repaid to you, and you will not be wronged. But if they incline to peace, then incline to it and rely upon Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing.
8:62-66	And if they intend to deceive you, [O Muhammad] - then sufficient for you is Allah. It is He who supported you with His victory and with the believers and brought their hearts together. If you had spent all that is in the earth, you could not have brought their hearts together; but Allah brought them together. Indeed, He is Exalted in Might and Wise. O Prophet, sufficient for you is Allah and those who follow you of the believers. O Prophet, urge the believers to fight. If there are twenty among you, patient, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are a hundred among you, they will overcome a thousand of those who disbelieve - because they are a people who do not understand. Now Allah has lightened your burden and knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are a hundred among you, patient, they will overcome two hundred. And if there are a thousand among you, they will overcome two thousand by permission of Allah. And Allah is with the patient.
8:67-71	"It is not for a prophet to have captives until he has inflicted a slaughter upon the land. You desire the goods of this world, but God desires the Hereafter. And God is Exalted in Might and Wise. Had it not been for a previous decree from God, a great punishment would have afflicted you for what you took. So eat of that which you have taken as lawful and good spoils, and fear God. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Merciful. O Prophet, say to those in your hands of the captives, ""If God knows any good in your hearts, He will give you better than what was taken from you and forgive you. And God is Forgiving and Merciful."" And if they intend to betray you - they betrayed God before, and He gave them power over you. And God is Knowing and Wise."
8:72-75	Indeed, those who have believed and emigrated and striven hard with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah, and those who have given shelter and aided - those are allies of one another. And those who have believed and not emigrated - you have no guardianship over them at all until they emigrate. And if they seek aid of you in religion, then aid is your duty, except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing. And those who disbelieve are allies of one another. If you do not do so, there will be fitnah on earth and great corruption. And those who have believed and emigrated and striven hard in the cause of Allah, and those who have given shelter and aided - those are the believers, truly; for them is forgiveness and noble provision. And those who believed afterwards and emigrated and striven hard with you - those are from you. And those of kinship are nearer to one another in the Book of Allah. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things.
9:1-6	A declaration from Allah and His Messenger to those of the polytheists with whom you made a treaty. So travel freely throughout the land for four months and know that you cannot escape Allah and that Allah will disgrace the disbelievers. And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger to the people on the day of the greater pilgrimage that Allah is free from the polytheists and so is His Messenger. So if you repent, it is better for you, but if you turn away, then know that you cannot escape Allah. And give tidings to those who disbelieve of a painful punishment. Except for those of the polytheists with whom you made a treaty and then they did not fail you in anything nor did they support anyone against you. So fulfill to them their treaty until their term. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous. So when the sacred months have passed, then kill the polytheists wherever you find them and capture them and besiege them and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush. But if they repent and establish prayer and give zakah, then let them go on their way. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And if any of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the word of Allah. Then escort him to a place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.
9:7-11	How can there be a treaty with Allah and with His Messenger, except for those with whom you made a treaty at al-Masjid al-Haram? So long as they are upright with you, be upright with them. Indeed, Allah loves the righteous. How can there be a treaty with the polytheists when they gain the upper hand over you? They do not observe concerning you any pact of kinship or covenant. They please you with their mouths, but their hearts refuse, and most of them are wicked. They exchange the verses of Allah for a small price and avert [people] from His way. Indeed, evil is that which they have been doing. They do not observe concerning a believer any pact of kinship or covenant. It is those who are the transgressors. But if they repent, establish prayer, and give zakah, then they are your brothers in religion. And We detail the verses for a people who know.
9:12-16	But if they break their oaths after their covenant and attack your religion, then fight the leaders of disbelief - for indeed, there are no oaths to them - that perhaps they will desist. Will you not fight a people who have broken their oaths and intended to expel the Messenger, and they initiated [the attack] against you the first time? Do you fear them? But Allah has more right that you should fear Him, if you are believers. Fight them; Allah will punish them by your hands and will disgrace them and give you victory over them and satisfy the breasts of a believing people and remove the anger of their hearts. And Allah turns in mercy to whom He wills. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. Or do you think that you will be left while Allah has not yet made evident those among you who strive and have not taken as allies other than Allah or His Messenger or the believers? And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.
9:17-18	It is not for the polytheists to maintain the mosques of Allah while they testify against themselves of disbelief. For those, their deeds have become worthless, and in the Fire they will abide eternally. The mosques of Allah shall be maintained only by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and establish prayer and give zakah and do not fear except Allah - it is expected that those will be among the [rightly] guided.
9:19-22	Have you considered the providing of water to the pilgrims and the maintenance of the Sacred Mosque equal to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day and strives in the cause of Allah? They are not equal in the sight of Allah, and Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. Those who have believed and emigrated and striven in the cause of Allah with their wealth and their lives are greater in degree in the sight of Allah. And it is those who are the successful. Their Lord gives them good tidings of mercy from Him and approval and gardens for them wherein is lasting pleasure. They will abide therein forever. Indeed, Allah has with Him a great reward.
9:23-24	"O you who have believed, do not take your fathers and your brothers as allies if they prefer disbelief over faith. And whoever allies with them among you - then those are the wrongdoers. Say, ""If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have acquired, the commerce in which you fear decline, and the dwellings in which you delight are dearer to you than Allah and His Messenger and striving in His cause, then wait until Allah brings about His decision. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people."""
9:25-27	Allah has already given you victory on many occasions, and on the day of Hunayn, when your great number pleased you, but it did not avail you at all, and the earth, vast as it is, became strait for you; then you turned back, fleeing. Then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers, and sent down soldiers you did not see, and punished those who disbelieved. That is the recompense of the disbelievers. Then Allah will turn in mercy after that to whom He wills. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
9:28-29	O you who have believed, indeed, the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach al-Masjid al-Haram after this year of theirs. But if you fear poverty, then Allah will enrich you from His bounty, if He wills. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Wise. Fight those who do not believe in Allah or the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth from among those who were given the Scripture - until they pay the jizyah with willing submission while they are subdued.
9:30-31	"The Jews said, ""Ezra is the son of God,"" and the Christians said, ""The Messiah is the son of God."" That is their statement from their mouths; they imitate the statement of those who disbelieved before. May God destroy them! How are they deluded? They have taken their rabbis and their monks as lords besides God, and the Messiah, the son of Mary. And they were commanded not except to worship one God; there is no deity except Him. Exalted is He above what they associate with Him."
9:32-33	They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it. It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although they who associate others with Allah dislike it.
9:34-35	"O you who have believed, indeed many of the scholars and the monks devour the wealth of people unjustly and avert [people] from the way of Allah. And those who hoard gold and silver and do not spend it in the way of Allah - give them tidings of a painful punishment. The Day when it will be heated in the fire of Hell and their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs will be branded with it, [it will be said], ""This is what you hoarded for yourselves, so taste what you used to hoard."""
9:36-37	Indeed, the number of months with Allah is twelve [lunar] months in the register of Allah [from] the day He created the heavens and the earth; of these, four are sacred. That is the right religion, so do not wrong yourselves during them. And fight the polytheists collectively as they fight you collectively. And know that Allah is with the righteous. The postponement is only an increase in disbelief by which those who disbelieve go astray. They make it lawful one year and forbid it another year in order to conform to the number of what Allah has forbidden. So they make lawful what Allah has forbidden. The evil of their deeds has been made pleasing to them. And Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
9:38-40	"O you who have believed, what is [the matter] with you that, when you are told to go forth in the cause of Allah, you adhere heavily to the earth? Are you satisfied with the life of this world rather than the Hereafter? But what is the enjoyment of the life of this world compared to the Hereafter except a little? If you do not go forth, He will punish you with a painful punishment and will substitute another people for you, and you will not harm Him at all. And Allah has power over all things. If you do not aid him - Allah has already aided him when those who disbelieved had expelled him, one of two, when they were in the cave and he said to his companion, ""Do not grieve; indeed Allah is with us."" So Allah sent down His tranquility upon him and supported him with soldiers you did not see and made the word of those who disbelieved the lowest, while the word of Allah - that is the highest. And Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise."
9:41-41	Go forth, whether light or heavy, and strive with your wealth and your lives in the cause of God. That is best for you, if you only knew.
9:42-49	"Had it been a near offer and a short journey, they would have followed you, but the distance was too great for them. And they will swear by Allah, ""If we could, we would have gone out with you."" They would destroy themselves, but Allah knows that they are liars. Allah has pardoned you. Why did you give them permission until it became clear to you who are truthful and you knew who are the liars? Those who believe in Allah and the Last Day do not ask your permission to wage jihad with their wealth and their lives. And Allah is Knowing of the righteous. It is only those who do not believe in Allah and the Last Day and whose hearts doubt, so in their doubt they waver. And if they had intended to go out, they would have made preparation for it, but Allah disliked their going out, so He held them back. And it was said, ""Stay with those who stay behind."" Had they gone out with you, they would not have increased you except in confusion, and they would have spread their influence among you, seeking to cause you discord. And among you are those who listen to them. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers. They sought discord before and distorted matters for you until the truth came and the command of Allah appeared, while they were averse. And among them is he who says, ""Give me permission and do not put me to trial."" Unquestionably, into trial they have fallen. And indeed, Hell will encompass the disbelievers."
9:50-52	"If good befalls you, it distresses them, but if disaster befalls you, they say, ""We took our decision beforehand,"" and they turn away while they are rejoicing. Say, ""Nothing will ever happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us. He is our protector, and in Allah let the believers put their trust."" Say, ""Do you await for us anything but one of the two best things while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with a punishment from Himself or at our hands? So await; indeed, we are with you awaiting."""
9:53-55	"Say, ""Spend willingly or unwillingly - it will never be accepted from you. Indeed, you are a defiantly disobedient people."" And nothing prevented their spending from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and they do not come to prayer except while they are lazy and they do not spend except while they are reluctant. So do not let their wealth or their children impress you. Allah only intends to punish them thereby in worldly life and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers."
9:56-59	They swear by God that they are of you, but they are not of you, but they are a people who are afraid. If they could find a refuge or caves or a place of entry, they would turn to it, rushing headlong. And among them is he who criticizes you concerning the charities. If they are given therefrom, they are pleased; but if they are not given therefrom, at once they become angry. And if they had been satisfied with what God and His Messenger have given them and said, “Sufficient for us is God; God will give us from His bounty, and [so will] His Messenger. Indeed, we are toward God desirous.”
9:60-61	"Alms are only for the poor and the needy and those employed to collect them and those whose hearts are to be reconciled and to free captives and those in debt and for the cause of Allah and for the wayfarer - an obligation imposed by Allah. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. And among them are those who annoy the Prophet and say, ""He is an ear."" Say, ""An ear of good for you. He believes in Allah and believes in the believers and is a mercy to those who have believed among you."" And those who annoy the Messenger of Allah will have a painful punishment."
9:62-66	"They swear to you by Allah to please you, but Allah and His Messenger have more right that they should please Him, if they are believers. Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger - for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he will abide eternally? That is the great disgrace. The hypocrites fear that a surah will be sent down about them informing them of what is in their hearts. Say, ""Mock on; indeed, Allah will bring out that which you fear."" And if you ask them, they will surely say, ""We were only conversing and joking."" Say, ""Was it at Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?"" Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon one party of you, We will punish another party because they were criminals."
9:67-68	The hypocrites, men and women, are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and withhold their hands. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them. Indeed, the hypocrites - they are the wicked. Allah has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the disbelievers the fire of Hell, wherein they will abide eternally. That is sufficient for them. Allah has cursed them, and for them is an enduring punishment.
9:69-70	Like those before you who were stronger than you in strength and had more wealth and children. So enjoy yourselves with them, and you enjoy yourselves with them as those before you enjoyed theirs, and you plunged into [a state of] vain [i.e., into] conflict as they plunged into conflict. Those - their deeds have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and it is those who are the losers. Has there not come to them the news of those before them - the people of Noah, Aad, and Thamud, the people of Abraham, the companions of Madyan, and the overthrown cities? Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. So it was not Allah who would wrong them, but they were wronging themselves.
9:71-72	The believing men and believing women are allies of one another. They enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong and establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Those - Allah will have mercy upon them. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Wise. Allah has promised the believing men and believing women gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and goodly dwellings in Gardens of Eden. But the approval of Allah is greater. That is what is the great attainment.
9:73-74	O Prophet, strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination. They swear by Allah that they did not say [the truth]. But they did say the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their Islam, and intended that which they did not attain. And they only resented Allah and His Messenger from His bounty. So if they repent, it will be better for them, but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And there will be for them upon the earth neither protector nor helper.
9:75-80	"And among them are those who made a covenant with Allah, ""If He should give us from His bounty, we will surely give in charity and be among the righteous."" But when He gave them from His bounty, they were stingy with it and turned away, averse. So He made hypocrisy follow them in their hearts until the Day they meet Him, because they broke what they promised Allah and because they used to lie. Do they not know that Allah knows their secrets and their private conversations and that Allah is the Knower of the unseen? Those who slander those among the believers who give voluntary charity and those who find only their effort, so they ridicule them - Allah will ridicule them, and they will have a painful punishment. Ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them - even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times - Allah will not forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people."
9:81-85	Those who stayed behind rejoiced at remaining behind the Messenger of Allah (PBUH) and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah. They said, “Do not go forth in the heat.” Say, “The fire of Hell is more intense in heat, if only they understood.” So let them laugh a little and weep much as recompense for what they used to earn. But if Allah returns you to a party of them and they ask your permission to go out, say, “You will never go out with me, nor will you fight an enemy with me. You were content to sit back the first time, so sit with those who stayed behind.” And do not pray over any of them who dies, nor stand at his grave. Indeed, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were wicked. And do not be impressed by their wealth and children. Allah only intends to punish them with them in this world and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers.
9:86-87	And when a surah is revealed, [saying], “Believe in Allah and strive with His Messenger,” those of wealth among them ask your permission and say, “Leave us to be with those who sit [at home].” They are content to be with those who stay behind, and their hearts are sealed so they do not understand.
9:88-89	But the Messenger and those who believed with him strove with their wealth and their lives. And it is those who will have the good things, and it is those who are the successful. God has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. That is the great attainment.
9:90-96	"And the excuse-makers among the bedouins came to be permitted to leave, while those who denied Allah and His Messenger sat back. A painful punishment will afflict those among them who disbelieved. There is no blame upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend if they are sincere in the interest of Allah and His Messenger. There is no blame upon the doers of good - and Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Nor upon those who, when they come to you that you may mount them, say, ""I find nothing upon which to mount you,"" they turn back while their eyes overflow with tears out of grief that they do not find anything to spend. The blame is only upon those who ask your permission while they are wealthy. They are content to be with those who stay behind, and Allah has set a seal upon their hearts so they do not know. They will make excuses to you when you return to them. Say, ""Do not make excuses. We will never believe you. Allah has already informed us of your news. And Allah will see your deeds and [so will] His Messenger. Then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you used to do."" They will swear to you by Allah when you return to them to turn away from them, so turn away from them. Indeed, they are unclean, and their refuge is Hell as recompense for what they used to earn. They swear to you that you may be pleased with them. But if you are pleased with them, then indeed, Allah is not pleased with the wicked people."
9:97-99	The desert Arabs are more extreme in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits set by Allah upon His Messenger. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. And among the desert Arabs are some who take what they spend as a loss and lie in wait for you to suffer misfortune. Upon them is the misfortune of evil. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. And among the desert Arabs are some who believe in Allah and the Last Day and take what they spend as means of drawing closer to Allah and invoking prayers of the Messenger. Unquestionably, it is a means of drawing closer to them. Allah will admit them into His mercy. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
9:100-100	And the first forerunners [in Islam] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him - and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment.
9:101-106	"And among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites and among the people of Medina are stubborn hypocrites. You do not know them - We know them. We will punish them twice; then they will be returned to a great punishment. And others have acknowledged their sins. They mixed a righteous deed with another evil. Perhaps Allah will turn to them in mercy. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Take from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and sanctify them, and pray for them. Indeed, your prayers are reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. Do they not know that it is Allah who accepts repentance from His servants and takes the charities? And that it is Allah who is the Accepter of repentance, the Merciful. And say, ""Work, and Allah will see your work and [so will] His Messenger and the believers. And you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you about what you used to do."" And others are awaiting the command of Allah - whether He will punish them or turn to them in mercy. And Allah is Knowing and Wise."
9:107-110	"And those who have taken a mosque [for worship] [to cause] harm and disbelief and division among the believers and [as] an ambush for those who had warred against Allah and His Messenger before - and they will surely swear, ""We intended only good"" - and Allah bears witness that they are liars. Never stand therein. A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand therein. Within it are men who love to purify themselves - and Allah loves those who purify themselves. Is he who laid the foundation of his structure on piety toward Allah and [His] approval better or he who laid the foundation of his structure on the brink of a crumbling precipice so it collapsed with him into the fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. The structure which they have constructed will continue to be a source of doubt in their hearts until their hearts are cut out. And Allah is Knowing and Wise."
9:111-112	Indeed, Allah has purchased from the believers their lives and their properties in exchange for that they will have Paradise. They fight in the cause of Allah, so they kill and are killed - a true promise binding upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur'an. And who is truer to his covenant than Allah? So rejoice in your transaction which you have contracted - and that is what is the great attainment. [Those who] repent, worship, praise, fast [in Ramadan], bow [in prayer], prostrate [in prayer], enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and observe the limits set by Allah. And give good tidings to the believers.
9:113-116	It is not for the Prophet and those who have believed to ask forgiveness for the polytheists, even if they were relatives, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of Hellfire. And Abraham's asking forgiveness for his father was only because of a promise he had made to him. But when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of Allah, he disassociated himself from him. Indeed, Abraham was most kind and forbearing. And Allah would never lead a people astray after He had guided them until He made clear to them what they should avoid. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things. Indeed, to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death. And you have not besides Allah any protector or helper.
9:117-121	Allah has indeed turned to the Prophet and the Muhajireen and the Ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship, after the hearts of a party of them had almost deviated; then He turned to them. Indeed, He is to them Kind and Merciful. And to the three who stayed behind until, when the earth became strait for them, vast as it is, and their souls became strait for them and they perceived that there is no refuge from Allah except in Him; then He turned to them in forgiveness that they might repent. Indeed, Allah is the Accepter of Repentance, the Merciful. O you who have believed, fear Allah and be with the truthful. It was not for the people of Madinah and those around them of the bedouins to stay behind the Messenger of Allah or to prefer themselves over himself. That is because they were not afflicted with thirst or fatigue or hunger in the cause of Allah, nor did they tread a path to rouse the anger of the disbelievers, nor did they attain any objective against the enemy, but a good deed was recorded for them because of it. Indeed, Allah does not allow the reward of the doers of good to be lost. And they did not spend a small amount or a large amount, nor did they cross a valley, but it was recorded for them that Allah might reward them with the best of what they used to do.
9:122-123	It is not for the believers to go forth all at once. Why should not a party from every division of them go forth to gain understanding in the religion and warn their people when they return to them that they may beware? O you who have believed, fight those of the disbelievers adjacent to you and let them find in you harshness and know that Allah is with the righteous.
9:124-127	"And when a surah is revealed, some of them say, ""Which of you has this increased in faith?"" As for those who believe, it increases them in faith, and they rejoice. But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it increases them defilement upon their defilement, and they die while they are disbelievers. Do they not see that they are tested once or twice every year, then they do not repent, nor do they remember? And when a surah is revealed, they look at one another, ""Does anyone see you?"" Then they turn away. Allah has turned their hearts away because they are a people who do not understand."
9:128-129	"There has certainly come to you a Messenger from among yourselves. Grievous to him is what you suffer; he is concerned over you and to the believers is kind and merciful. But if they turn away, then say, ""Sufficient for me is God; there is no deity except Him. In Him I have relied, and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne."""
10:1-2	"These are the verses of the Wise Book. Is it a wonder to the people that We inspired a man from among themselves, ""Warn the people and give good tidings to those who believe that they will have a sure footing with their Lord?"" The disbelievers say, ""Indeed, this is an obvious magician."""
10:3-6	Indeed, your Lord is Allah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then established Himself on the Throne. He directs the affair. There is no intercessor except after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him, then will you not be reminded? To Him is your return all together. The promise of Allah is truth. Indeed, He begins creation and then will repeat it, that He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds with justice. But as for those who disbelieve, they will have a drink of scalding water and a painful punishment for what they used to disbelieve. It is He who made the sun a radiance and the moon a light and determined for it phases - that you may know the number of years and account. Allah did not create this except in truth. He details the signs for a people who know. Indeed, in the alternation of the night and the day and in what Allah has created in the heavens and the earth are signs for a people who fear Allah.
10:7-10	"Indeed, those who do not expect the meeting with Us and are satisfied with the life of this world and feel secure in it and those who are heedless of Our signs - their refuge will be the Fire because of what they used to earn. Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - their Lord will guide them because of their faith. Beneath them rivers will flow in Gardens of Pleasure. Their prayer therein will be, ""Glory be to You, O Allah,"" and their greeting therein will be, ""Peace,"" and the final prayer will be, ""Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds."""
10:11-14	And if Allah were to hasten for people evil as they hasten for good, their term would have been ended for them. So We leave those who do not expect the meeting with Us, wandering blindly in their transgression. And when harm touches man, he invokes Us lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove his harm from him, he passes on as if he had never invoked Us for harm that has touched him. Thus has been made attractive to the transgressors what they used to do. And We had certainly destroyed generations before you when they did wrong and Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they were not to believe. Thus do We recompense the criminal people. Then We made you successors upon the earth after them that We may see how you will act.
10:15-17	"And when Our clear verses are recited to them, those who do not expect the meeting with Us say, ""Bring a Qur'an other than this or change it."" Say, ""It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow what is revealed to me. Indeed, I fear, if I disobeyed my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day."" Say, ""If God had willed, I would not have recited it to you, nor would He have made it known to you. I have remained among you a lifetime before it. Then will you not reason?"" So who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about God or denies His verses? Indeed, the criminals will not succeed."
10:18-20	And they worship besides Allah that which can neither harm them nor benefit them, and they say, “These are our intercessors with Allah.” Say, “Do you inform Allah of that which He does not know in the heavens or on the earth?” Glory be to Him and exalted be He above what they associate with Him. And mankind was not but one community, then they differed. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord, it would have been judged between them concerning that over which they differ. And they say, “Why was a sign not sent down to him from his Lord?” Say, “The unseen belongs only to Allah, so wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait.”
10:21-23	"And when We let the people taste mercy after adversity has touched them, at once they plot against Our verses. Say, ""Allah is swifter in plotting. Indeed, Our messengers record what you plot."" It is He who travels you on land and sea until, when you are in ships and they sail with them with a fair wind and they rejoice in it, there comes a storm wind and the waves come upon them from every side and they think that they are surrounded, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion, [saying], ""If You should save us from this, we will surely be among the grateful."" But when He saves them, at once they rebel upon the earth without right. ""O mankind, your rebellion is only against yourselves - the enjoyment of worldly life. Then to Us is your return, and We will inform you about what you used to do."""
10:24-25	The example of the life of this world is like water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it - from which men and livestock eat - until, when the earth has taken on its adornment and is beautified and its people think that they have control over it, Our command comes to it by night or by day, and We make it as a harvest, as if it had never flourished yesterday. Thus do We detail the verses for a people who give thought. And God invites to the home of peace and guides whom He wills to a straight path.
10:26-27	For those who do good is the best [reward] and even more. Neither darkness nor disgrace will cover their faces. Those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally. But as for those who have earned evil deeds, the recompense of evil will be equal to it, and disgrace will cover them. They will have from Allah no protector. It will be as if their faces were covered with pieces of the dark night. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally.
10:28-30	"And the Day We shall gather them all together, then We shall say to those who associated [others], ""Stay where you were, you and your associates."" Then We shall remove from them, and their associates will say, ""It was not us that you used to worship."" So sufficient is Allah as Witness between us and you, that we were, of your worship, unaware. There every soul will be tested for what it put forth, and they will be returned to Allah, their True Master, and lost from them is that which they used to invent."
10:31-33	"Say, ""Who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Or who controls hearing and sight? And who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living? And who directs the affair?"" They will say, ""God."" Say, ""Then will you not fear God?"" That is God, your Lord, the Truth. And what is there after the truth except error? So how are you averted? Thus has the word of your Lord come into effect upon those who defiantly disobey - that they will not believe."
10:34-36	"Say, ""Is there among your associates one who initiates creation and then repeats it?"" Say, ""Allah initiates creation and then repeats it, so how are you deluded?"" Say, ""Is there among your associates one who guides to the truth?"" Say, ""Allah guides to the truth. Is he who guides to the truth more worthy to be followed, or he who guides not unless he is guided? So what is the matter with you? How do you judge?"" Most of them follow nothing but conjecture. Conjecture avails nothing against the truth. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do."
10:37-44	This Qur’an could not have been invented by other than Allah, but it is a confirmation of what was before it and a detailed explanation of the Book - about which there is no doubt - from the Lord of the worlds. Or do they say, “He invented it”? Say, “Then produce a surah like it and call upon whomever you can besides Allah, if you should be truthful.” Rather, they have denied that of which they have no comprehensive knowledge, and its interpretation has not yet come to them. Thus did those before them deny. So see how was the end of the wrongdoers. And among them is he who believes in it and among them is he who does not believe in it. And your Lord is most knowing of the corrupters. But if they deny you, then say, “To me is my work, and to you is your work. You are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what you do.” And among them are those who listen to you, “Can you make the deaf hear, even though they do not reason?” And among them are those who look at you, so can you guide the blind, even though they do not see?” Indeed, Allah does not wrong the people at all, but it is people who wrong themselves.
10:45-53	"And on the Day He will gather them together as if they had not remained [in the world] except for an hour of a day, they will recognize one another. Indeed, those who denied the meeting with Allah and were not [rightly] guided have lost. And whether We show you some of what We promise them, or We cause you to die - to Us is their return. Then Allah is Witness over what they do. And for every nation is a messenger. So when their messenger comes, the matter will be judged between them in justice, and they will not be wronged. And they will say, ""When is this promise, if you should be truthful?"" Say, ""I do not control for myself any harm or benefit except what Allah wills."" For every nation is a term [determined] when their term comes, they will not delay an hour nor will they advance it. Say, ""Have you considered: if His punishment should come upon you by night or by day, what of it the criminals are impatient for? Then, when it comes, will you believe in it now, while you used to impress it?"" Then it will be said to those who did wrong, ""Taste the punishment of eternity. Are you being recompensed except for what you used to earn?"" And they ask you, ""Is it true?"" Say, ""Yes, by my Lord; it is the truth, and you will not escape."""
10:54-56	And if every soul that has wronged had all that is in the earth, it would offer it as ransom. And they will conceal their regret when they see the punishment, and it will be judged between them in justice, and they will not be wronged. Unquestionably, to God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Unquestionably, the promise of God is truth, but most of them do not know. It is He who gives life and causes death, and to Him you will be returned.
10:57-60	"O mankind, there has come to you instruction from your Lord and healing for what is in the breasts and guidance and mercy for the believers. Say, ""In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy - in that let them rejoice; it is better than what they accumulate."" Say, ""Have you considered what Allah has sent down to you of provision, then you made some of it lawful and some unlawful?"" Say, ""Has Allah permitted you, or do you invent a lie against Allah?"" And what will those who invent a lie against Allah think on the Day of Resurrection? Indeed, Allah is full of bounty to the people, but most of them are not grateful."
10:61-61	And you are not engaged in any affair, nor do you recite from it any Qur’an, nor do you do any deed, but We are witnesses over you when you are engaged in it. And not an atom’s weight is hidden from your Lord, whether on the earth or in the heaven, nor anything smaller than that or larger, but that it is in a clear register.
10:62-64	Verily, the allies of Allah have nothing to fear, nor shall they grieve. Those who believed and were fearing Allah. For them are good tidings in the worldly life and in the Hereafter. No change is there in the words of Allah. That is what is the great attainment.
10:65-70	"And let not their statement grieve you. Indeed, all honor belongs to Allah. He is the Hearing, the Knowing. Unquestionably, to Allah belongs whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth. And those they invoke besides Allah do not follow partners. They follow not except assumption, and they do not but guess. It is He who made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day to see. Indeed in that are signs for a people who listen. They say, ""Allah has taken a son."" Glory be to Him! He is the Free of need. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Indeed, you have any authority for this. Do you say about Allah that which you do not know? Say, ""Indeed, those who invent falsehood about Allah will not succeed."" [An enjoyment in this world; then to Us is their return. Then We will make them taste the severe punishment for what they used to disbelieve."
10:71-73	"And recite to them the news of Noah, when he said to his people, ""O my people, if my stay is burdensome to you and my reminding you of the verses of Allah, then upon Allah I have relied. So decide your plan, you and your associates, then let not your plan be in doubt for you. Then carry it out against me and do not give me respite. But if you turn away, then I have not asked you for any payment. My payment is only from Allah, and I have been commanded to be of the Muslims."" But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship and made them successors and drowned those who denied Our verses. So see how was the end of those who were warned."
10:74-78	"Then We sent after him messengers to their people, and they came to them with clear proofs. But they were not to believe in that which they had denied before. Thus do We seal the hearts of the transgressors. Then We sent after them Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his establishment with Our signs, but they were arrogant and were a criminal people. But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, ""Indeed, this is obvious magic."" Moses said, ""Do you say of the truth when it has come to you, 'Is this magic?'"" But magicians will not succeed. They said, ""Have you come to us to turn us away from what we found our fathers doing and so that you two may have greatness upon the earth? And we will not believe you."""
10:79-86	"And Pharaoh said, ""Bring me every learned magician."" So when the magicians came, Moses said to them, ""Throw down what you are casting."" And when they had cast, Moses said, ""What you have brought is magic. Indeed, Allah will nullify it. Indeed, Allah does not amend the work of corrupters."" And Allah establishes the truth by His words, although the criminals dislike it. But none believed in Moses except a few descendants of his people, for fear of Pharaoh and his chiefs, lest he should persecute them. And indeed, Pharaoh was exalted in the land, and indeed, he was of the transgressors. And Moses said, ""O my people, if you have believed in Allah, then rely upon Him, if you should be Muslims."" But they said, ""In Allah we have relied. Our Lord, do not make us a trial for the wrongdoing people. And save us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people."""
10:87-89	"And We inspired Moses and his brother, saying, ""Settle for your people in Egypt in houses and make your houses places of prayer and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believers."" And Moses said, ""Our Lord, indeed You have given Pharaoh and his establishment adornment and wealth in the life of this world. Our Lord, that they may mislead [others] from Your way. Our Lord, obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so they will not believe until they see the painful punishment."" He said, ""Your prayer has been answered, so be upright and do not follow the way of those who do not know."""
10:90-93	"And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in oppression and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, ""I believe that there is no god except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims [submitting], [O Muhammad]! Now [is this]? Although you disobeyed before and were of the corrupters. So this Day We shall save you with your body that you may be a sign to those who come after you. And indeed, many of the people, of Our signs, are heedless. And We had certainly settled the Children of Israel in a dwelling of truth and provided for them of the good things, but they did not differ until there came to them knowledge. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ."""
10:94-97	If you are in doubt about what We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], then ask those who have been reading the Scripture before you. The truth has certainly come to you from your Lord, so do not be among the doubters. And do not be among those who deny the signs of Allah and you will be among the losers. Indeed, those upon whom the Word of your Lord has come into effect will not believe, even if every sign should come to them until they see the painful punishment.
10:98-103	"Why was there not a city that believed, and its faith benefited it, except the people of Jonah? When they believed, We removed from them the punishment of disgrace in the worldly life and gave them enjoyment for a time. And if your Lord had willed, those on earth could have believed, all of them together. Then would you compel the people in order that they are believers? And it is not for a soul to believe except by permission of Allah. And He places defilement upon those who do not reason. Say, ""Look at what is in the heavens and the earth."" But neither signs nor warners avail a people who do not believe. Do they await except like the days of those who passed on before them? Say, ""Then wait; indeed, I am with you among those who wait."" Then We will deliver Our messengers and those who have believed. Thus is it incumbent upon Us to deliver the believers."
10:104-106	"Say, ""O mankind, if you are in doubt about my religion, then I do not worship those you worship besides Allah, but I worship Allah, who will cause you to die. And I have been commanded to be of the believers and to direct your face toward the religion, inclining toward truth, and do not be of those who associate others with Allah. And do not invoke besides Allah that which neither benefits you nor harms you. For if you did, then indeed you would be among the wrongdoers."""
10:107-109	"And if Allah should touch you with adversity, there is none who can remove it except Him. And if He intends for you good, there is none who can repel His favor. He causes it to reach whom He wills of His servants. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. Say, ""O mankind, the truth has come to you from your Lord. So whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever goes astray only goes astray to his detriment. And I am not a guardian over you. And follow what is revealed to you and be patient until Allah makes judgment. And He is the best of judges."""
11:1-5	The Book whose verses are perfected and then presented in detail from One Who is Wise and Acquainted. [This is] a ... whereby you worship none but Allah. Indeed, to you from Him I am a warner and a bringer of good tidings. And if you seek forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him, He will grant you good provision for a specified term and will bestow on every possessor of bounty his bounty. But if you turn away, then indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a great Day. To Allah is your return, and He is over all things competent. Indeed, they turn away their breasts to conceal themselves from Him. Indeed, when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they declare. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
11:6-7	"There is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its provision, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage. All is in a clear register. And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and His Throne was over the water - that He might test you [as to] which of you is best in deed. And if you say, ""Indeed, you will be resurrected after death,"" those who disbelieve will surely say, ""This is not but obvious magic."""
11:8-11	"And if We delay the punishment from them for a specified term, they will surely say, ""What is holding it back?"" Unquestionably, the Day it comes to them, it will not be averted from them, and that which they used to ridicule will encompass them. And if We let a man taste mercy from Us and then take it away from him, indeed, he is despairing and ungrateful. And if We let him taste favor after adversity has touched him, he will surely say, ""The bad times have departed from me."" Indeed, he is exultant and boastful. Except for those who are patient and do righteous deeds. For those is forgiveness and a great reward."
11:12-12	Perhaps you would abandon some of what is revealed to you and your chest would be constrained by it because they would say, “Why was a treasure not sent down to him or an angel not brought with him?” You are only a warner, and God is, over all things, Disposer of affairs.
11:13-14	Or do they say, “He has invented it?” Say, “Then bring ten surahs like it that have been invented and call upon whomever you can besides Allah, if you should be truthful.” But if they do not respond to you, then know that it was only revealed with the knowledge of Allah and that there is no deity except Him. So will you submit [to Allah]?
11:15-17	Whoever desires the life of this world and its adornments - We fully repay them for their deeds therein, and they therein will not be deprived. Those are the ones for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter except the Fire. And worthless is what they did therein, and void is what they used to do. Then is one who is upon clear evidence from his Lord and has a witness recited to him from Him, and before him was the Scripture of Moses as an guide and a mercy - those are the ones who believe in him. But whoever disbelieves in him from the factions - the Fire is his promised time, so be not in doubt about it. Indeed, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the people do not believe.
11:18-24	"And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie against Allah? Those will be brought before their Lord, and the witnesses will say, ""These are the ones who lied against their Lord."" Unquestionably, the curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers. Those who avert [people] from the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers. Those were never able to cause failure upon the earth, and they had no protectors other than Allah. The punishment will be doubled for them. They were not able to hear, nor were they able to see. Those are the ones who have lost their souls, and what they used to invent has gone astray from them. There is no doubt that, in the Hereafter, they will be the greatest losers. Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds and humbled themselves before their Lord - those are the companions of Paradise; they will abide therein eternally. The example of the two groups is like that of the blind and the deaf and the seeing and the hearing. Are they equal in comparison? Then will you not be reminded?"
11:25-31	"And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, [saying], ""Indeed, I am to you a clear warner, [saying], 'Worship none but Allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a painful Day.' But the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people said, 'We do not see you except as a human being like ourselves. And we do not see that you are followed except by those who are the lowest of us in outward opinion. And we do not see that you have any favor over us. Rather, we think you are liars.' He said, 'O my people, have you considered: if I have clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me mercy from Himself but it has become blind to you, should we force it upon you while you are averse to it?' And, 'O my people, I do not ask of you any wealth for it. My reward is only from Allah. And I will not drive away those who have believed. Indeed, they will meet their Lord. But I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly.' And, 'O my people, who will protect me from Allah if I drive them away? Then will you not be reminded?' And I do not say to you, 'With me are the treasures of Allah.' Nor do I know the unseen. Nor do I say that I am an angel. Nor do I say to those whom your eyes despise, 'Allah will never give them any good.' Allah knows best what is within their souls. Indeed, I would then be among the wrongdoers."
11:32-35	"They said, ""O Noah, you have disputed with us and prolonged the dispute with us, so bring us what you threaten us with, if you should be of the truthful."" He said, ""Only Allah will bring it to you if He wills, and you will not escape."" And my advice will not benefit you, if I intended to advise you, if Allah intended to mislead you - He is your Lord, and to Him you will be returned. Or do they say, ""He has invented it?"" Say, ""If I have invented it, upon me is my crime, and I am innocent of what you commit."""
11:36-37	"And it was revealed to Noah, ""None of your people will believe except those who have already believed, so do not be distressed by what they have been doing. And construct the ark under Our eyes and with Our inspiration, and do not address Me concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are to be drowned."""
11:38-40	"And he built the ark, and every time a group of his people passed by him, they ridiculed him. He said, ""If you ridicule us, then we will ridicule you as you ridicule. And you are going to know who will be afflicted with a punishment that will disgrace him and upon whom will be inflicted a lasting punishment. Until, when Our command came and the oven overflowed, We said, 'Load onto it of every kind two mates and your family, except for those against whom the word has already been decreed and for those who believe.' But none believed with him except a few."
11:41-44	"And he said, ""Embark therein, in the name of Allah is its course and its anchorage. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."" And it sailed with them through waves like mountains. And Noah called to his son, who was apart, ""O my son, embark with us and be not with the disbelievers."" He said, ""I will seek refuge on a mountain that will protect me from the water."" He said, ""There is no protector today from the decree of Allah except for him on whom He has mercy."" And the waves came between them, and he was among the drowned. And it was said, ""O earth, swallow your water, and O sky, refrain."" And the water subsided, and the matter was accomplished, and the ship came to rest on the Judiyy. And it was said, ""Away with the wrongdoing people."""
11:45-48	"And Noah called upon his Lord, and said, ""My Lord, indeed my son is of my family, and indeed, Your promise is true, and You are the Most Just of judges."" He said, ""O Noah, indeed he is not of your family. Indeed, he has done other than righteousness. So never ask Me about that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, I advise you, lest you be among the ignorant."" He said, ""My Lord, indeed I seek refuge in You from asking You about that of which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers."" It was said, ""O Noah, disembark with peace from Us and blessings upon you and upon nations from those with you. And nations We will grant enjoyment; then a painful punishment will touch them from Us."""
11:49-49	This is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad]. You knew it not, nor did your people, before this. So be patient. Indeed, the [best] outcome is for the righteous.
11:50-60	"And to Aad [We sent] their brother Hud. He said, ""O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. You are not but inventing things. O my people, I do not ask of you any payment for this. My payment is only from He who created me. Then will you not reason?"" And, O my people, ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in showers and add to your strength [to your strength]. And do not turn away, [being] criminals."" They said, ""O Hud, you have not brought us clear proof, nor will we abandon our gods because of what you say, nor will we believe in you. We only say that some of our gods have afflicted you with evil."" He said, ""Indeed, I call Allah to witness, and you to witness, that I am innocent of what you associate with Him. So plot against me all together and then do not respite. Indeed, I have put my trust in Allah, my Lord and your Lord. There is no creature but that He holds its forelock. Indeed, my Lord is on a straight path."" But if they turn away, I have already conveyed to you that with which I was sent to you. And my Lord will replace you with a people other than you, and you will not harm Him at all. Indeed, my Lord, over all things, is Guardian. And when Our command came, We saved Hud and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and We saved them from a severe punishment. And those were 'Aad. They denied the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers and followed the command of every obstinate tyrant. And a curse pursued them in this world and on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, 'Aad disbelieved in their Lord. So away with 'Aad, the people of Hud."
11:61-68	"And to Thamud [We sent] their brother Salih. He said, ""O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. He produced you from the earth and settled you in it. So ask forgiveness of Him and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is near and responsive."" They said, ""O Salih, you were among us a source of hope before this. Do you forbid us from worshipping what our fathers worshipped? And indeed, we are in disturbing doubt about that to which you invite us?"" He said, ""O my people, have you considered? If I am upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has given me mercy from Himself, then who can protect me from Allah if I disobey Him? You will only increase me in loss. And, O my people, this she-camel of Allah is a sign to you, so leave her to graze in Allah's earth and do not touch her with harm, lest a near punishment seize you."" But they hamstrung her. He said, ""Enjoy yourselves in your homes for three days. That is a promise unfaltering."" But when Our command came, We saved Salih and those who believed with him by mercy from Us and from the disgrace of that Day. Indeed, your Lord is the Powerful, the Exalted in Might. But the blast seized those who did wrong, and they became within their homes prostrate, as if they had never flourished therein. Unquestionably, Thamud disbelieved in their Lord. So away with Thamud."
11:69-76	"And Our messengers had already come to Abraham with good tidings. They said, ""Peace."" He said, ""Peace."" And he did not stay long before he brought a roasted calf. But when he saw that their hands did not reach it, he disliked them and felt fear of them. They said, ""Do not fear. Indeed, we have been sent to the people of Lot, and his wife was standing there, and she laughed. So We gave her good tidings of Isaac, and after Isaac, Jacob. She said, ""Woe to me! Shall I give birth while I am an old woman and my husband is an old man? Indeed, this is a strange thing."" They said, ""Do you wonder at the command of Allah? The mercy of Allah and His blessings be upon you, O people of the House. Indeed, He is Praiseworthy and Glorious."" So when the fear had departed from Abraham and the good tidings had come to him, he began to argue with Us concerning the people of Lot. Indeed, Abraham was forbearing, penitent, and frequently turning back [to Allah]. O Abraham, turn away from this. Indeed, the command of your Lord has come, and there will come upon them a punishment that cannot be averted."
11:77-83	"And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed by them and felt straitened for them and said, ""This is a difficult day."" And his people came to him running toward him, and before that they used to commit evil deeds. He said, ""O my people, these are my daughters; they are purer for you, so fear Allah and do not disgrace me regarding my guests. Is there not among you a man of reason?"" They said, ""Indeed, you know that we have no right to your daughters, and indeed, you know what we intend."" He said, ""If only I had power over you or could take refuge in a strong support."" They said, ""O Lot, indeed we are messengers of your Lord; they will never reach you. So set out with your family during a part of the night and do not look back from you anyone except your wife. Indeed, what has befallen them will strike her. Indeed, their appointed time is the morning. Is not the morning near?"" But when Our command came, We turned it upside down and rained upon it stones of hard clay, one after the other. Marked from your Lord, and not far from the wrongdoers."
11:84-88	"And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shu'ayb. He said, ""O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. And do not give short measure and weight. Indeed, I see you in prosperity, and indeed, I fear for you the punishment of an encompassing Day. And, O my people, give full measure and weight in justice and do not deprive people of their due rights and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption. What Allah has left is better for you, if you should be believers. And I am not a guardian over you."" They said, ""O Shu'ayb, does your prayer command you that we should forsake what our fathers worshipped or that we should do with our wealth as we please? Indeed, you are indeed the forbearing, the rightly guided."" He said, ""O my people, have you considered: if I am upon clear evidence from my Lord and He has provided me from Him a good provision - and I do not intend to go against you in that from which I forbid you - I only desire reform as much as I am able. And my success is not except through Allah. Upon Him I rely, and to Him I turn."""
11:89-95	"And, O my people, do not let my dissension prevent you from being afflicted with what afflicted the people of Noah or the people of Hud or the people of Salih. And the people of Lot are not far from you. And ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him. Indeed, my Lord is Merciful and Affectionate. They said, ""O Shu'aib, we do not understand much of what you say. And indeed, we see you weak among us. And were it not for your family, we would have stoned you, and you are not mighty over us."" He said, ""O my people, is my family more mighty to you than Allah? And you have taken Him as your backs. Indeed, my Lord is encompassing of what you do. And, O my people, act according to your position. Indeed, I am acting. You will soon know who will be afflicted with a punishment that will disgrace him and who is a liar. And wait. Indeed, I am with you, an Observer."" And when Our command came, We saved Shu'aib and those who believed with him by mercy from Us, and the blast seized those who did wrong, so they became within their homes fallen down, as if they had never flourished therein. Now away with Midian, as away with Thamud."
11:96-99	And We had certainly sent Moses with Our signs and clear authority to Pharaoh and his establishment, but they followed the command of Pharaoh - and Pharaoh's command was not right. He will lead his people on the Day of Resurrection and lead them into the Fire - and wretched is the destination. And they will be pursued in this [world] with a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection - wretched is the destination.
11:100-102	This is from the news of the towns We relate to you, [O Muhammad], some of them standing [in the mountains] and some [of them] harvested. And We wronged them not, but they wronged themselves. So their gods which they invoked besides God did not avail them at all when the command of your Lord came, and they only increased them in perdition. And such is the punishment of your Lord when He punishes the towns while they are wrongdoers. Indeed, His punishment is painful and severe.
11:103-108	Indeed in that is a sign for whoever fears the punishment of the Hereafter. That is a Day for which the people will be gathered, and that is a witnessed Day. And We do not delay it except for a specified term. The Day it comes, no soul will speak except by His permission. Then among them will be the wretched and the blessed. But as for those who are wretched, they will be in the Fire - for them there will be sighing and sobbing. They will abide therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except what your Lord wills. Indeed, your Lord is an Doer of what He intends. But as for those who are blessed, they will be in Paradise, abiding therein as long as the heavens and the earth endure, except what your Lord wills - a gift uninterrupted.
11:109-111	So be not in doubt about what these people worship. They do not worship except as their fathers worshipped before. And indeed, We will give them their share undiminished. And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture, but they differed therein. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord, it would have been judged between them. And indeed, they are in disquieting doubt about it. And indeed, your Lord will surely pay them in full their due reward. Indeed, He is Acquainted with what they do.
11:112-115	So stand firm as you have been commanded, and those who have repented with you, and do not transgress. Indeed, He is Seeing of what you do. And do not incline toward those who do wrong, lest the Fire touch you, and you will not have besides Allah any protectors; then you will not be helped. And establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night. Indeed, good deeds do away with misdeeds. That is a reminder for those who remember. And be patient; indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.
11:116-117	Why were there not among the generations before you people of intelligence who would forbid corruption on the earth, except a few of those We saved from among them? And those who did wrong pursued that in which they were luxuriant and were criminals. And your Lord would not destroy the cities unjustly while their people were righteous.
11:118-119	And if your Lord had willed, He could have made mankind one community; but they will not cease to differ. Except whom your Lord has given mercy - and for that He created them. And the word of your Lord has been fulfilled, “I will surely fill Hell with jinn and people all together.”
11:120-123	"And We relate to you from the news of the messengers what strengthens your heart. And there has come to you in this the truth and instruction and a reminder for the believers. And say to those who do not believe, ""Work according to your position, indeed, we are working. And wait, indeed, we are waiting."" And to God belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth, and to Him will return the matter, all of it, so worship Him and put your trust in Him. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do."
12:1-3	Alif, Lam, Ra. These are the verses of the clear Book. Indeed, We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an that you might understand. We relate to you the best of stories in what We have revealed to you of this Qur’an although you were, before it, among the unaware.
12:4-6	"When Joseph said to his father, ""O my father, indeed I have seen eleven stars and the sun and the moon. I saw them prostrating to me."" He said, ""O my son, do not relate your vision to your brothers, lest they devise a plan against you. Indeed, Satan is to man a clear enemy."" And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of dreams and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac. Indeed, your Lord is Knowing and Wise."
12:7-10	"There were certainly in Joseph and his brothers signs for those who asked. When they said, ""Joseph and his brother are more beloved to our father than we, while we are a whole company. Indeed, our father is in manifest error. Kill Joseph or cast him out to some land, so that your father's favor will be exclusively for you, and you will be after him a righteous people."" One of them said, ""Do not kill Joseph, but throw him into the bottom of the well. Some caravan may pick him up, if you must do something."""
12:11-15	"They said, ""O our father, what is the matter with you that you do not trust us with Joseph while we are indeed his sincere well-wishers? Send him with us tomorrow that he may frolic and play, and we will surely guard him."" He said, ""Indeed, it grieves me that you should take him away, and I fear that a wolf may eat him while you are of him unaware."" They said, ""If the wolf should eat him while we are a company, then we will surely be losers."" So when they had taken him away and decided to put him in the bottom of the well, We inspired to him, ""You will surely inform them of this affair of theirs while they do not perceive."""
12:16-18	"And they came to their father at nightfall, weeping. They said, ""O our father, indeed we went racing each other and left Joseph with our belongings, and a wolf ate him. And you would not believe us, even if we were truthful."" And they brought false blood on his shirt. He said, ""Rather, your souls have enticed you to do something, so patience is most fitting. And Allah is the sought for help against that which you describe."""
12:19-22	"And a cart came, so they sent their water-drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, ""Good news! This is a boy!"" And they concealed him as merchandise, and Allah is Knowing of what they do. And they sold him for a cheap price, a few dirhams, and they were of those who despised him. And he who bought him from Egypt said to his wife, ""Make his stay comfortable; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son."" And thus We established Joseph in the land and that We might teach him of the interpretation of dreams. And Allah is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know. And when he reached his full strength, We gave him judgment and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good."
12:23-29	"And she in whose house he was sought to seduce him, and she shut the doors and said, ""Come on, come to me."" He said, ""God forbid! Indeed, my Lord has made my residence good. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed."" And she certainly desired him, and he would have desired her had he not seen the proof of his Lord. Thus We enable us to avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants. And they raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back. And they found her master at the door. She said, ""What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your family except that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?"" He said, ""She sought to seduce me."" And a witness from her family testified, ""If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars. But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful."" But when he saw that his shirt was torn from the back, he said, ""Indeed, it is of your plot. Indeed, your plot is great."" Joseph, ""Turn away from this and ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinners."""
12:30-32	"And the women of the city said, ""The wife of Al-'Aziz is seeking to seduce her young man. He has overcome her with love. Indeed, we see that she is in manifest error."" But when she heard of their plot, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet. And she gave each one of them a knife and said, ""Come out to them."" But when they saw him, they admired him and cut their hands and said, ""God forbid! This is not a human being! This is none other than a noble angel."" She said, ""This is why you blamed me. Indeed, I sought to seduce him, but he refused. And if he does not do what I command him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be among the debased."""
12:33-35	"He said, ""My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. If You do not turn away from me their plot, I will incline toward them and be among the ignorant."" So his Lord responded to him and turned away from him their plot. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing. Then it appeared to them, after they had seen the signs, to imprison him for a time."
12:36-42	"And two young men entered prison with him. One of them said, ""Indeed, I have seen myself pressing wine."" And the other said, ""Indeed, I have seen myself carrying on my head bread from which birds are eating. Inform us of its interpretation. Indeed, we see that you are of the doers of good."" He said, ""No food will come to you that you are provided with except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah and, in the Hereafter, they are disbelievers. And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It was not for us to associate anything with Allah. That is from the favor of Allah upon us and upon mankind, but most people do not give thanks. O my two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Prevailing? You worship not besides Him except names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Judgment belongs only to Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That is the right religion, but most people do not know. O my companions of prison, as for one of you, he will make his Lord drink wine, and as for the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter concerning which you inquire has been decided."" He said to the one he thought would be saved, “Mention me to your Lord.” But Satan made him forget to mention his Lord, so he remained in prison for several years."
12:43-49	"The king said, ""Indeed, I have seen seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of corn and others dry. O eminent ones, advise me concerning my vision, if you should interpret visions."" They said, ""Confused dreams, and we are not knowledgeable about the interpretation of dreams."" The one of the two who had escaped and remembered after a while said, ""I will inform you of its interpretation, so send [me]."" Joseph, O man of truth, advise us concerning seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean ones, and seven green ears of corn and others dry. Perhaps I may return to the people that they may know. He said, ""You shall sow for seven years in succession, and whatever you reap leave it in its ear, except a little of what you eat. Then after that will come seven difficult years which will consume what you have put away for them, except a little of what you store. Then after that will come a year in which the people will be given plenty and in which they will press [their crops]."""
12:50-57	"And the king said, ""Bring him to me."" And when the messenger came to him, he said, ""Return to your lord and ask him what was the matter with the women who cut their hands. Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plot."" He said, ""What was the matter with you when you sought to seduce Joseph?"" They said, ""God forbid! We know nothing of evil about him."" The wife of al-'Aziz said, ""Now the truth has become clear. I did seek to seduce him, and indeed, he is of the truthful."" That is so that he may know that I did not betray him in secret, and that God does not guide the plot of the treacherous. And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil, except for that upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful."" And the king said, ""Bring him to me, that I may attach him to myself."" And when he spoke to him, he said, ""Indeed, you are today with Us established and trustworthy."" He said, ""Appoint me over the storehouses of the land. Indeed, I am a knowing guardian."" And thus We established Joseph in the land, that he might settle therein wherever he wills. We bestow Our mercy upon whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of the doers of good. And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believe and are fearing God."
12:58-62	"And Joseph's brothers came and entered upon him, and he recognized them, but they did not recognize him. And when he had furnished them with their provisions, he said, ""Bring me a brother of yours from your father. Do you not see that I give full measure, and I am the best of hosts? But if you do not bring him to me, you will have no measure with me, nor shall you come near."" They said, ""We will surely persuade his father about him, and we will surely do so."" And he said to his young men, ""Put their merchandise in their saddlebags that they may recognize it when they return to their families. Perhaps they will return."""
12:63-66	"So when they returned to their father, they said, ""O our father, he has denied us measure, so send our brother with us, and we will surely guard him."" He said, ""Shall I trust you with him except as I trusted you with his brother before? But Allah is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful."" And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said, ""O our father, what do we desire? This is our merchandise that has been returned to us, and we will provide for our family and guard our brother and get an extra camel load. That is a small load."" He said, ""I will not send him with you until you give me a pledge in the name of Allah that you will bring him back to me, unless you are surrounded."" But when they gave him their pledge, he said, ""Allah is Witness over what we say."""
12:67-68	"And he said, ""O my sons, do not enter by one gate, but enter by separate gates. And I cannot avail you at all against Allah. Indeed, the judgment belongs only to Allah. Upon Him I have relied, and upon Him let the reliant rely."" And when they entered from where their father had commanded them, it could not avail them at all against Allah except a need in Jacob's soul which he fulfilled. And indeed, he was full of knowledge because of what We taught him, but most of the people do not know."
12:69-76	"And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself. He said, ""Indeed, I am your brother, so do not be sad for what they used to do."" So when he had furnished them with their provisions, he put the drinking cup in his brother's saddlebag. Then a crier proclaimed, ""O caravan, indeed you are thieves."" They said as they approached them, ""What are you missing?"" They said, ""We have lost the king's cup, and whoever brings it will have a camel-load, and I will be responsible for it."" They said, ""By God, you certainly know that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, nor are we thieves."" They said, ""Then what is his recompense, if you are lying?"" They said, ""His recompense is he in whose saddlebag it is found, that is his recompense. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers."" So he began with their vessels before his brother's vessel, then he extracted it from his brother's vessel. Thus did We plan for Joseph. It was not for him to take his brother under the king's law except that God should will. We raise by degrees whom We will, and above every possessor of knowledge is One Knowing."""
12:77-79	"They said, ""If he steals, a brother of his stole before."" But Joseph kept it to himself and did not reveal it to them. He said, ""You are in a worse position, and God is most knowing of what you describe."" They said, ""O noble one, indeed he has an old father, so take one of us in his place. Indeed, we see you as one of the doers of good."" He said, ""God forbid that we should take except him with whom we found our property. Indeed, then we would be wrongdoers."""
12:80-80	"Then when they despaired of him, they conferred privately. Their eldest said, ""Did you not know that your father took a solemn pledge from you in the name of God, and that you had neglected Joseph before? 'I will never leave the land until my father gives me permission or God judges for me. And He is the best of judges.'"
12:81-87	"Go back to your father and say, ""O our father, indeed your son has stolen, and we only testified to what we knew, and we were not guardians of the unseen. And ask the town where we were and the caravan where we came, and indeed, we are truthful."" He said, ""Rather, your souls have enticed you to do something, so patience is most fitting. Perhaps Allah will bring them all to me. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise."" And he turned away from them and said, ""Oh, my grief over Joseph!"" And his eyes became white from grief, and he was suppressing it. They said, ""By Allah, you will not cease remembering Joseph until you become fatally ill or are among the dead."" He said, ""I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you do not know. O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from Allah. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allah except the disbelieving people."""
12:88-92	"So when they entered upon him, they said, ""O noble one, distress has touched us and our family, and we have brought poor merchandise, so give us full measure and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable."" He said, ""Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?"" They said, ""Are you indeed Joseph?"" He said, ""I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has conferred favor upon us. Indeed, whoever fears Allah and is patient - then indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good."" They said, ""By Allah, Allah has favored you over us, although we were indeed sinners."" He said, ""No blame will there be upon you this Day. Allah will forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful."""
12:93-96	Go with this shirt of mine and cast it over my father's face; he will regain his sight. And bring me all your family.' And when the caravan had departed, their father said, 'Indeed, I sense the fragrance of Joseph, unless you think it is false.' They said, 'By God, you are still in your old error.' But when the bearer of good news came, he cast it over his face, and he regained his sight. He said, 'Did I not tell you that I know from God that which you do not know?'
12:97-101	"They said, ""O our father, ask forgiveness for us our sins; indeed, we were sinners."" He said, ""I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful."" So when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to him and said, ""Enter Egypt, if God wills, in safety."" And he raised his parents to the throne, and they fell down before him in prostration. And he said, ""O my father, this is the interpretation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it come true. And He was kind to me when He brought me out of prison and brought you from the desert after Satan had sown dissension between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle to whom He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise. My Lord, You have given me of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dreams. Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my protector in this world and in the Hereafter. Cause me to die a Muslim and join me with the righteous."""
12:102-107	This is from the news of the unseen which We reveal to you, [O Muhammad], and you were not with them when they decided upon their plan while they were plotting. And not most of the people, even if you were eager to do so, would believe. And you do not ask them for any payment for it. It is not but a reminder to the worlds. And how many a sign is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by while they are turning away from it? And most of them do not believe in Allah except while they associate others with Him. So do they then feel secure that there will not come upon them an overwhelming punishment from Allah or that the Hour will not come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive?
12:108-111	"Say, ""This is my way. I invite to Allah with insight, I and whoever follows me. And exalted is Allah; and I am not of those who associate others with Allah."" And We did not send before you, [O Muhammad], except men to whom We revealed, from the people of the towns. Have they not traveled through the land and observed what was the end of those before them? And the home of the Hereafter is best for those who fear Allah. So will you not reason? Until, when the messengers despaired and thought that they had been denied, there came to them Our victory, and We saved whom We willed, but Our punishment cannot be averted from the criminal people. There was certainly in their stories a lesson for those of understanding. It was not a narrative invented, but a confirmation of that which was before it and a detailed explanation of all things and guidance and mercy for a people who believe."
13:1-4	These are the verses of the Book, and what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth, but most of the people do not believe. It is Allah who raised the heavens without pillars that you can see. Then He established Himself on the Throne and subjected the sun and the moon, each running for a specified term. He directs the affair. He details the verses that you may, of the meeting with your Lord, be certain. And it is He who spread out the earth and placed therein firm mountains and rivers. And of all the fruits He made therein two mates. He causes the night to cover the day. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought. And on the earth are neighboring tracts and gardens of grapevines and crops and palm trees, some twin and some unpaired, watered with the same water. And We make some of them excel others in taste. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason.
13:5-7	And if you wonder, then wonder is their statement: “When we are dust, shall we then be in a new creation?” Those are the ones who disbelieved in their Lord - and those - the shackles will be around their necks, and those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. And they ask you to hasten the evil before the good, although there have been examples before them. And indeed, your Lord is full of forgiveness for the people, despite their wrongdoing. And indeed, your Lord is severe in penalty. And those who disbelieve say, “Why was a sign not sent down to him from his Lord?” You are only a warner, and for every people is a guide.
13:8-11	Allah knows what every female bears and what the wombs absorb and what they gain, and everything with Him is by measured measure. Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Great, the Most High. Whether among you is he who conceals his speech or declares it aloud, or he who hides it by night or goes forth by day - He has protectors before him and behind him who guard him by the command of Allah. Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. And when Allah intends ill for a people, there is no repelling it. And they will have besides Him no protector.
13:12-13	It is He who shows you the lightning, [causing] fear and hope, and produces the heavy clouds. And the thunder exalts [Allah] with praise of Him, and [so do] the angels for fear of Him. And He sends the thunderbolts and strikes with them whom He wills while they dispute about Allah, and He is severe in penalty.
13:14-17	"His is the true call. And those they invoke besides Him do not respond to them with anything except as one who extends his hands toward water to reach his mouth, but it will not reach it. And the invocation of the disbelievers is not but in error. And to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or by compulsion, and so do their shadows in the mornings and the evenings. Say, ""Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth?"" Say, ""Allah."" Say, ""Have you taken besides Him protectors who do not possess for themselves any benefit or harm?"" Say, ""Are the blind and the seeing equal? ​​Or are darkness and light equal? ​​Or have they attributed to Allah partners who created like His creation so that the creation became alike to them?"" Say, ""Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is the One, the Prevailing."" He sends down water from the sky, and valleys flow according to their capacity, and the torrent carries a swelling foam. And from that which they heat in the fire in search of adornment or goods is a foam like it. Thus does Allah present truth and falsehood. As for the foam, it vanishes as scum, but that which benefits people remains on the earth. Thus does Allah present examples."
13:18-24	For those who have responded to their Lord is the best [reward]. And for those who have not responded to Him - if they had all that is in the earth and as much more besides it, they would ransom themselves thereby - those will have an evil account, and their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the resting place. Is he who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth like one who is blind? Only those of understanding will remember. Who fulfill the covenant of Allah and do not break the contract. And those who join what Allah has ordered to be joined and fear their Lord and dread the evil account. And those who are patient, seeking the countenance of their Lord and establish prayer and spend from what We have provided them, secretly and publicly, and avert evil with good - those will have the best [final] home. Gardens of Eden - they will enter them, as will those who were righteous among their fathers and their spouses and their descendants. And the angels will enter upon them from every gate. Peace be upon you for what you patiently endured. And excellent is the final home.
13:25-27	"And those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it and sever that which Allah has ordered to be joined and spread corruption on earth - those will have the curse, and they will have the worst home. Allah enlarges provision for whom He wills and restricts it. And they rejoice in the worldly life. But the worldly life is not compared to the Hereafter except an enjoyment. And those who disbelieve say, ""Why was a sign not sent down to him from his Lord?"" Say, ""Indeed, Allah leaves astray whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him]."""
13:28-29	Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured. Those who have believed and done righteous deeds - for them is bliss and a good place of return.
13:30-34	Thus We have sent you to a nation before which other nations have passed on, that you may recite to them what We have revealed to you, while they disbelieve in the Most Merciful. Say, “He is my Lord; there is no god except Him. Upon Him I rely, and to Him is my return.” And if there had been a Qur’an by which mountains could be moved, or the earth could be split asunder, or the dead could be made to speak by it. Rather, to Allah belongs the command entirely. Have not those who have believed despaired that if Allah willed, He could have guided all people? And those who disbelieve will not cease to be struck by a calamity for what they have done, or it will descend near their home until the promise of Allah comes to pass. Indeed, Allah does not fail in His promise. And messengers before you were mocked, but I granted respite to those who disbelieved; then I seized them, so how was My punishment? Is he who stands over every soul for what it has earned? And they have attributed to Allah partners. Say, “Name them, or do you inform Him of that which he does not know on the earth, or only an outward appearance of speech?” Rather, their plot has been made attractive to those who disbelieve, and they have averted [people] from the way. And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no guide. For them is a punishment in the life of this world, and the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe, and there is no protector for them from Allah.
13:35-35	The description of Paradise, which the righteous have been promised, is that beneath it rivers flow, its food is everlasting and its shade is eternal. That is the outcome of those who fear God, and the outcome of the disbelievers is the Fire.
13:36-37	"And those to whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in what has been revealed to you, [O Muhammad], but among the factions are those who deny part of it. Say, ""I have only been commanded to worship Allah and not to associate anything with Him. To Him I invite, and to Him is my return."" And thus We have sent it down as an Arabic judgment. And if you were to follow their desires after what has come to you of knowledge, you would have against Allah neither protector nor helper."
13:38-43	"And We had certainly sent messengers before you, and appointed for them wives and offspring. And it was not for a messenger to bring a sign except by permission of Allah. For every term is a decree. Allah blots out what He wills and confirms, and with Him is the Mother of the Book. And if We show you some of what We promise them or cause you to die - your duty is only to convey [the message], and upon Us is the account. Have they not seen that We come to the land, reducing it from its borders? And Allah judges; there is no adjuster of His judgment, and He is swift in account. And those before them had already plotted, but to Allah belongs all plotting. He knows what every soul earns, and the disbelievers will know for whom is the final home. And those who disbelieve say, ""You are not a messenger."" Say, ""Sufficient is Allah as a witness between me and you, and whoever has knowledge of the Book."""
14:1-4	Alif, Lam, Ra. This is a Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that you may bring mankind out of darknesses into the light, by permission of their Lord, to the path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy. To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And woe to the disbelievers from a severe punishment. Those who prefer the life of this world over the Hereafter and avert [people] from the way of Allah and seek to make it crooked - those are in extreme error. And We did not send any messenger except in the language of his people to state clearly to them. So Allah leaves astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And He is the Almighty, the Wise.
14:5-8	"And We had certainly sent Moses with Our signs, [saying], ""Bring your people out from darknesses into the light and remind them of the days of Allah. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful."" And when Moses said to his people, ""Remember the favor of Allah upon you when He delivered you from the people of Pharaoh, who were afflicting you with the worst of torment and slaughtering your sons and sparing your women. And in that was a great trial from your Lord. And when your Lord proclaimed, ""If you are grateful, I will surely increase you [in favor]; but if you deny, indeed, My punishment is severe."" And Moses said, ""If you deny, you and whoever is on the earth entirely - then indeed, Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy."""
14:9-12	"Has there not come to you the news of those before you - the people of Noah, Aad, and Thamud, and those after them, none knows them but Allah? Their messengers came to them with clear proofs, but they put their hands to their mouths and said, ""Indeed, we disbelieve in that with which you have been sent, and indeed, about that to which you invite us, is in disquieting doubt."" Their messengers said, ""Is there any doubt about Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth? He invites you to forgive you some of your sins and respite you for a specified term."" They said, ""You are only human beings like us. You want to avert us from that which our fathers used to worship. So bring us a clear authority."" Their messengers said to them, ""We are only human beings like you, but Allah bestows favor upon whom He wills of His servants. And it was not for us to bring you authority except by Allah's permission. And upon Allah let the believers put their trust. And why should we not put our trust in Allah while He has guided us to our ways? And we will surely be patient over what you have harmed us. And upon Allah let the trustful put their trust."""
14:13-18	"And those who disbelieved said to their messengers, ""We will surely expel you from our land, or you must return to our religion."" But their Lord inspired to them, ""We will surely destroy the wrongdoers and will surely inhabit you in the land after them."" That is for whoever fears My position and fears My threat. And they sought victory, but every obstinate tyrant was disappointed. Behind him is Hell, and he will be given to drink of festering water. He swallows it but can scarcely swallow it. Death comes to him from every side, but he is not to die. Behind him is a severe punishment. The example of those who disbelieve in their Lord is that their deeds are like ashes upon which the wind blows violently on a stormy day. They will not be able to do anything about what they have earned. That is what is the extreme error."
14:19-20	Have you not seen that God created the heavens and the earth in truth? If He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation. And that is not difficult for God.
14:21-23	"And they will all appear before Allah, and the weak will say to those who were arrogant, ""Indeed, we were your followers. Can you protect us from the punishment of Allah at all?"" They will say, ""If Allah had guided us, we would have guided you. It is the same for us whether we are impatient or patient. There is no escape for us."" And Satan will say, when the matter has been decided, ""Indeed, Allah promised you the promise of truth, and I promised you, but I broke my promise to you. And I had no authority over you except that I invited you and you responded to me. So do not blame me but blame yourselves. I cannot be your savior, nor can you be my savior. Indeed, I have disbelieved in what you associated with Him before. Indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment."" And those who believe and do righteous deeds will be admitted to gardens beneath which rivers flow, to abide therein by permission of their Lord. Their greeting therein is, ""Peace."""
14:24-27	Have you not considered how Allah presents an example: a good word is like a good tree, whose root is firm and its branches reach to heaven. It brings forth its fruit at all times by permission of its Lord. And Allah presents examples for the people that perhaps they will be reminded. And the example of a bad word is like a bad tree, uprooted from the surface of the earth, having no stability. Allah makes firm those who believe, with the firm word, in the life of this world and in the Hereafter. And Allah sends astray the wrongdoers, and Allah does what He wills.
14:28-30	"Have you not considered those who exchanged the favor of Allah for disbelief and settled their people in the home of destruction - Hell, which they will burn in, and wretched is the settlement? And they set up rivals for Allah to mislead [people] from His way. Say, ""Enjoy yourselves, for indeed, your destination is the Fire."""
14:31-34	Tell My servants who have believed to establish prayer and spend from what We have provided for them, secretly and publicly, before there comes a Day in which there will be no exchange or friendship. It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down water from the sky and brought forth thereby fruits as provision for you. And He has subjected to you the ships that they may sail through the sea by His command and has subjected to you the rivers. And He has subjected to you the sun and the moon, both constantly pursuing their courses, and He has subjected to you the night and the day. And He has given you of all you asked of Him. And if you should count the favors of Allah, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, mankind is [generally] most unjust and ungrateful.
14:35-41	"And [mention] when Abraham said, ""My Lord, make this city secure and save me and my sons from worshipping idols. My Lord, indeed they have led astray many of the people. So whoever follows me - indeed, he is of me; and whoever disobeys me - indeed, You are Forgiving and Merciful."" Our Lord, indeed I have settled some of my descendants in an uncultivated valley near Your sacred House, our Lord, that they may establish prayer. So make hearts among the people incline toward them and provide for them from the fruits that they may be grateful. Our Lord, indeed You know what we conceal and what we declare. And nothing on the earth or in the heaven is hidden from Allah. Praise be to Allah, who has given me, in my old age, Ishmael and Isaac. Indeed, my Lord is the Hearer of supplication. My Lord, make me an establisher of prayer, and [many] from my descendants. Our Lord, and accept my supplication. Our Lord, forgive me and my parents and the believers the Day the account is established."""
14:42-46	"And never think that Allah is unaware of what the wrongdoers do. He only defers them for a Day on which eyes will stare [in horror]. They will rush forward with their heads bowed down, their glances not turning back to them, and their hearts [will be] empty. And warn the people of the Day when the punishment will come to them, and those who did wrong will say, ""Our Lord, defers us for a short term; we will respond to Your call and follow the messengers."" Did you not swear before that you would not perish? And you dwelt in the dwellings of those who wronged themselves, and it has become clear to you how We dealt with them, and We presented to you examples. And they planned their plan, but with Allah is their plan, although their plan was such that mountains would move."
14:47-52	So never think that Allah will fail to fulfill His promise to His messengers. Indeed, Allah is Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution. The Day the earth will be replaced by another earth, and the heavens [as well], and they will emerge before Allah, the One, the Prevailing. And you will see the criminals that Day bound together in shackles, their garments of pitch, and their faces covered with fire. So that Allah may recompense every soul for what it has earned. Indeed, Allah is swift in account. This is a message to mankind that they may be warned thereby and that they may know that He is but One Allah, and that those of understanding may be reminded.
15:1-9	"These are the verses of the Book and a clear Qur'an. Perhaps those who disbelieve will wish that they were Muslims. Leave them to eat and enjoy themselves and let hope delude them; they are going to know. And We did not destroy a city but that it had a known decree. No nation can precede its term, nor can they delay it. And they said, ""O you to whom the message has been sent down, indeed you are mad. Why do you not bring us the angels, if you should be of the truthful?"" We do not send down the angels except with the truth, and they are not then reprieved. Indeed, it is We who sent down the message and indeed, We will be its guardian."
15:10-15	"And We had certainly sent before you among the sects of former peoples. And there came not to them a messenger but that they ridiculed him. Thus do We cause it to enter the hearts of the criminals; they will not believe in it, although the precedent of the former peoples has passed away. And even if We opened to them a gate from heaven and they continued therein to ascend, they would surely say, ""Our eyes have only been dazzled. Rather, we are a people affected by magic."""
15:16-25	And We have certainly placed in the heaven great constellations and have beautified it for the observers. And We have protected it from every accursed devil, Except for one who steals a hearing and is pursued by a clear flame. And the earth We have spread out and placed therein firm mountains and caused to grow therein of every kind of beautiful thing. And We have made for you therein means of livelihood and for those for whom you are not providers. And there is not a thing but that with Us are its depositories. And We do not send it down except according to a known measure. And We send the winds as fertilizing agents, and We send down water from the sky and We give it to you to drink, and you are not its keepers. And indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and We are the inheritors. And We have certainly known those among you who went ahead, and We have certainly known those who came after. And indeed, your Lord - it is He - will gather them. Indeed, He is Wise and Knowing.
15:26-44	"And We have certainly created man from clay from an altered black mud. And the jinn We created before from scorching fire. And [mention] when your Lord said to the angels, ""Indeed, I am going to create a human being from clay from an altered black mud. And when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] spirit, then fall down to him in prostration."" So the angels prostrated, all of them together, except Iblis. He refused to be with those who prostrated. He said, ""O Iblis, what is [the matter] with you that you are not with those who prostrate?"" He said, ""Never would I prostrate to a human being whom I created from clay from an altered black mud."" He said, ""Then get out of it, for indeed, you are expelled. And indeed, upon you is the curse until the Day of Judgment."" He said, ""My Lord, then reprieve me until the Day they are resurrected."" He said, ""Indeed, you are of those reprieved."" Until the Day of the appointed time. He said, ""My Lord, because You have put me in error, I will surely make [disobedience] attractive to them on the earth, and I will mislead them all - Except for Your chosen servants among them."" He said, ""This is a path, straight for Me. Indeed, over My servants you will have no authority, except for those who follow you of the deviators."" And indeed, Hell is the promised place for them all. It has seven gates, for each of them is a portion allotted."
15:45-50	Indeed, the righteous will be among gardens and springs. Enter it in peace, secure. And We will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment [while they are] brothers facing each other on thrones. No fatigue will touch them therein, nor will they be removed from it. Inform My servants that it is I who am the Forgiving, the Merciful. And that it is My punishment that is the painful punishment.
15:51-60	"And inform them about the guests of Abraham. When they entered upon him and said, ""Peace."" He said, ""Indeed, we are of you, and fearful."" They said, ""Do not fear. Indeed, we give you good tidings of a learned boy."" He said, ""Have you given me good tidings although old age has touched me? Then with what do you give me good tidings?"" They said, ""We give you good tidings in truth, so do not be among the despairing."" He said, ""And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except those astray?"" He said, ""What is the matter with you, O messengers?"" They said, ""Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals - Except the family of Lot. Indeed, We will save them all - Except his wife - We destined that she will be among those who remain behind."""
15:61-77	"So when the messengers came to the family of Lot, he said, ""Indeed, you are a people who deny."" They said, ""Rather, we have brought you that about which they were in doubt. And we have brought you the truth, and indeed, we are truthful."" So set out with your family during a part of the night and pursue their rear and let not any of you look back and proceed where you are commanded. And We decreed for him that matter - that the rear of these people would be cut off in the morning. And the people of the city came, rejoicing. He said, ""Indeed, these are my guests, so do not disgrace me. And fear Allah and do not disgrace me."" They said, ""Did We not forbid you from the worlds?"" He said, ""These are my daughters, if you should do something."" By your life, they were in their intoxication, wandering blindly. Then the blast seized them while they were shining. Then We turned the upper part of it into the lower part and rained upon them stones of baked clay. Indeed in that are signs for those who take signs. And indeed, it is on a straight path. Indeed in that is a sign for the believers."
15:78-79	And indeed, the companions of the thicket were wrongdoers. So We took retribution from them, and indeed, they are in a clear sign.
15:80-84	And the companions of Al-Hijr denied the messengers. And We gave them Our signs, but they turned away from them. And they used to carve out of the mountains, houses, feeling secure. Then the blast seized them in the morning. But what they used to earn availed them not.
15:85-86	We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth. And the Hour is coming, so pardon with gracious pardon. Indeed, your Lord is the Creator, the Knowing.
15:87-89	And We have given you, [O Muhammad], seven of the oft-repeated verses and the great Qur’an. [Say:] Do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them, nor grieve over them, and lower your wing to the believers and say, “Indeed, I am the clear warner.”
15:90-99	As We sent down upon the dividers. Who divided the Qur'an into parts. By your Lord, We will surely question them all. About what they used to do. So proclaim openly what you are commanded and turn away from the polytheists. Indeed, We will suffice you against the mockers. Who set up with Allah another deity - they are going to know. And We certainly know that your breast is constrained by what they say. So exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord and be among those who prostrate. And worship your Lord until there comes to you the certainty.
16:1-9	The command of Allah has come, so do not hasten it. Glory be to Him and exalted is He above what they associate with Him. He sends down the angels with the Spirit by His command upon whom He wills of His servants, [saying], “Warn that there is no deity except Me, so fear Me.” He created the heavens and the earth in truth. Exalted is He above what they associate with Him. He created man from a sperm-drop, and at once he is a clear adversary. And the grazing livestock He has created for you; in them is warmth and [numerous] benefits, and from them you eat. And for you there is adornment in them when you drive them home and when you send them out to pasture. And they carry your loads to a land you could not have reached except with difficulty. Indeed, your Lord is Kind and Merciful. And [He has] the horses, mules, and donkeys for you to ride and as adornment. And He creates that which you do not know. And upon Allah is the direction of the way, and among them are deviants. And if He willed, He could have guided you all.
16:10-13	It is He who sends down water from the sky for you; from it you drink and from it come the vegetation on which you pasture your livestock. He causes thereby to grow for you the crops, the olives, the palm trees, the grapevines, and every kind of fruit. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought. And He has subjected to you the night and the day and the sun and the moon, and the stars are subjected by His command. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason. And He has created for you whatever is on the earth of varying colors. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who remember.
16:14-14	It is He who has subjected the sea so that you may eat tender meat from it and extract from it ornaments which you wear - and you see the ships plowing through it - and that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful.
16:15-18	And He has cast into the earth firm mountains, lest it should shift with you, and rivers and roads that you may be guided. And signs, and by the stars they are guided. Is He who creates like he who does not create? Then will you not be reminded? And if you should count the favors of Allah, you could not enumerate them. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
16:19-23	And Allah knows what you conceal and what you declare. And those they invoke besides Allah do not create anything, and they are themselves created. They are dead, not alive, and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected. Your God is one God. As for those who do not believe in the Hereafter, their hearts are denying, and they are arrogant. There is no doubt that Allah knows what they conceal and what they declare. Indeed, He does not like the arrogant.
16:24-29	"And when it is said to them, ""What has your Lord sent down,"" they say, ""Legends of the former peoples"" [in Arabic] - that they may bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also some of the burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge. Unquestionably, evil is that which they bear. Those before them plotted, but Allah struck their building from the foundations, so the roof fell upon them from above them, and the punishment came upon them from where they did not perceive. Then on the Day of Resurrection He will disgrace them and say, ""Where are My partners concerning whom you used to dispute?"" Those who were given knowledge will say, ""Indeed, disgrace and evil are upon the disbelievers today."" [They are] those whom the angels take in death while they are wronging themselves. So throw down [their] peace, [saying], ""We were not doing any evil."" Yes, indeed, Allah is Knowing of what you used to do. So enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein. And evil is the residence of the arrogant."
16:30-32	"And it will be said to those who feared God, ""What has your Lord revealed?"" They will say, ""Good."" For those who do good in this world is good, and the home of the Hereafter is better. And excellent is the home of the righteous. Gardens of perpetual residence, which they will enter, beneath which rivers flow. They will have therein whatever they wish. Thus does God reward the righteous. Those whom the angels take in death while they are good. They will say, ""Peace be upon you. Enter Paradise for what you used to do."""
16:33-34	Do they await aught but that the angels should come to them or that the command of your Lord should come? Thus did those before them. And Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. So the evil of what they did afflicted them, and that which they used to ridicule encompassed them.
16:35-40	"Those who associate others with God say, ""If God had willed, we would not have worshipped anything besides Him, nor would our fathers, nor would we have forbidden anything besides Him."" Thus did those before them. Is there any duty upon the messengers except to convey clearly? And We had already sent among every nation a messenger, [saying], ""Worship God and avoid false deities."" But among them were those whom God guided, and among them were those upon whom error was justly decreed. So travel through the land and observe what was the end of those who denied. If you are eager for their guidance - then indeed, God does not guide him who goes astray, and they will have no helpers. And they swear by God with their most solemn oaths that God will not resurrect anyone who dies. Yes, [it is] a promise binding upon Him, but most of the people do not know - [this] [this] [verse] - that He may make clear to them that over which they differ and that those who disbelieve may know that they were liars. Our word to a thing when We intend it is only that We say to it, ""Be,"" and it is."
16:41-42	And those who emigrated for the cause of Allah after they had been wronged - We will surely grant them good in this world, and the reward of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew. Those who are patient and upon their Lord rely.
16:43-50	And We did not send before you, [O Muhammad], except men to whom We revealed. So ask the people of the message if you do not know. With clear proofs and scriptures. And We have revealed to you the message that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them and that they might give thought. Then do those who plot evil deeds feel secure that Allah will not cause the earth to swallow them up or that the punishment will not come to them from where they do not perceive? Or that He will seize them in their turning [about] - then they will not escape? Or that He will seize them in fear - then indeed, your Lord is Kind and Merciful. Have they not seen what Allah has created of things? Its shadows turn to the right and the left, prostrating to Allah, while they are humbled. And to Allah prostrates whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth of creatures and the angels, and they are not arrogant. They fear their Lord above them and do what they are commanded.
16:51-55	And God said, “Do not take two gods. He is only one God, so fear Me.” To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and to Him is the religion, which is pure. Then will you fear other than God? And whatever blessing you have is from God. Then when adversity touches you, to Him you cry for help. Then, when He removes the adversity from you, at once a party of you associate others with their Lord, that they may disbelieve in what We have given them. So enjoy yourselves, and you are going to know.
16:56-62	And they assign to that which they do not know a share of what We have provided them. By Allah, you will surely be asked about what you used to invent. And they attribute to Allah daughters - glory be to Him - while for themselves there is whatever they desire. And when one of them is given the news of a female, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief. He hides himself from his people because of the evil of the news he has received. Should he keep her in disgrace or bury her in the dust? Unquestionably, evil is that which they judge. For those who do not believe in the Hereafter is an evil example. But to Allah belongs the highest example. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. And if Allah were to punish people for their wrongdoing, He would not leave upon it a single creature, but He defers them for a specified term. So when their term comes, they cannot remain behind an hour, nor can they precede it. And they attribute to Allah that which they dislike, and their tongues describe falsely that they will have the best. There is no doubt that they will have the Fire, and that they are transgressors.
16:63-64	By God, We sent to nations before you, but Satan made their deeds pleasing to them. So he is their ally this Day, and for them is a painful punishment. And We did not send down to you the Book except that you may make clear to them that wherein they differed and as guidance and mercy for a people who believe.
16:65-69	"And Allah sends down water from the sky, and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who listen. And indeed, for you in the grazing livestock is a lesson. We give you drink from what is in their bellies - between excrement and blood - pure milk, palatable to drinkers. And from the fruits of the palm trees and the grapevines you take intoxicant and good provision. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who reason. And your Lord inspired the bee, saying, ""Take hives in the mountains and in the trees and in what they construct. Then eat from all the fruits and follow the ways of your Lord made easy for you."" There emerges from their bellies a drink of varying colors in which is healing for people. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who give thought."
16:70-72	And Allah created you, then He causes you to die. And among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit age so that he knows nothing after [having] known. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Competent. And Allah has favored some of you over others in provision. But those who are favored would not give their provision to those their right hands possess, so they are equal therein. So is it the favor of Allah that they deny? And Allah has made for you mates from among yourselves and has made for you from your mates sons and grandchildren and has provided for you from the good things. So is it in falsehood that they believe and in the favor of Allah that they deny?
16:73-76	And they worship besides Allah that which possesses for them no provision from the heavens or the earth, nor are they able. So do not make comparisons for Allah. Indeed, Allah knows, while you do not know. Allah presents an example: a slave owned by someone who has no power over a thing, and one to whom We have provided a good provision from Us, so he spends from it secretly and publicly. Are they equal? ​​Praise be to Allah. But most of them do not know. And Allah presents an example: two men, one of them mute and unable to do anything, and he is a burden on his master. Wherever he directs him, he brings no good. Is he equal to one who enjoins justice while he is on a straight path?
16:77-79	To God belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth. And the matter of the Hour is not but as the blink of an eye or even nearer. Indeed, God is over all things competent. And God brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers not knowing a thing, and He gave you hearing and vision and hearts that you might give thanks. Have they not seen the birds controlled in the atmosphere of the sky? None holds them up except God. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
16:80-83	And Allah has made for you, from your houses, a place of rest. And He has made for you, from the hides of the grazing animals, dwellings which you find light on the day of your travel and the day of your settlement. And from their wool and their fur and their hair, furnishings and provisions for a time. And Allah has made for you, from what He has created, shades, and has made for you shelters from the mountains. And He has made for you garments to protect you from the heat and garments to protect you from your violence. Thus He completes His favor upon you that you may submit. But if they turn away, then upon you is only the clear notification. They recognize the favor of Allah, then they deny it, and most of them are disbelievers.
16:84-89	"And the Day We will raise up from every nation a witness, then permission will not be given to those who disbelieved, nor will they be asked to repent. And when those who did wrong see the punishment, it will not be lightened for them, nor will they be reprieved. And when those who associated others with Allah see their associates, they will say, ""Our Lord, these are our associates whom we used to invoke besides You."" So they will cast down to them the word, ""Indeed, you are liars."" And they will cast down to Allah that Day peace, and that which they used to invent will depart from them. As for those who disbelieved and averted [people] from the way of Allah - We will increase for them punishment over the punishment because they used to corrupt. And the Day We will raise up from every nation a witness over them from themselves. And We will bring you, [O Muhammad], as a witness over these. And We have sent down to you the Book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the Muslims."
16:90-93	Indeed, Allah commands justice, the doing of good, and liberality to kith and kin, and He forbids immorality, bad conduct, and oppression. He instructs you that you may receive admonition. And fulfill the covenant of Allah when you have made it, and do not break oaths after their confirmation, although you have made Allah, over you, a witness. Indeed, Allah knows that which you do. And do not be like she who untwisted the spun thread after it was strong, taking your oaths as a means of deceit among you - lest one community be more numerous than another. Allah only tests you thereby, and He will make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that over which you used to differ. And if Allah had willed, He could have made you one community, but He leaves astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And you will surely be questioned about what you used to do.
16:94-97	And do not take your oaths as a means of deception between you, lest your foot slip after it had been firmly planted, and you taste evil for having averted [people] from the way of Allah. And for you is a great punishment. And do not exchange the covenant of Allah for a small price. Indeed, with Allah is better for you, if you only knew. What you have will perish, and what is with Allah is lasting. And We will surely reward those who are patient [in patience] according to the best of what they used to do. Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - We will surely cause him to live a good life, and We will surely reward them according to the best of what they used to do.
16:98-102	"So when you recite the Qur’an, seek refuge in Allah from Satan, the accursed. Indeed, he has no authority over those who have believed and rely upon their Lord. His authority is only over those who take him as an ally and those who associate others with Him. And when We substitute a verse for another - and Allah is most knowing of what He sends down - they say, ""You are only an inventor."" But most of them do not know. Say, ""The Holy Spirit has brought it down from your Lord in truth to strengthen those who believe and as guidance and good tidings to the Muslims."""
16:103-109	"And We certainly know that they say, ""It is only a human being who teaches him."" The language of the one they refer to is foreign, while this is a clear Arabic tongue. Indeed, those who do not believe in the verses of Allah - Allah will not guide them, and they will have a painful punishment. Only those who do not believe in the verses of Allah invent falsehood, and it is those who are the liars. Who disbelieves in Allah after his belief, except for one who is forced thereto [while] his heart is at rest with faith? But as for those who open their breasts to disbelief - upon them is wrath from Allah, and they will have a great punishment. That is because they preferred the life of this world over the Hereafter, and because Allah does not guide the disbelieving people. Those are the ones whose hearts, hearing and vision Allah has sealed, and it is those who are the heedless. There is no doubt that in the Hereafter they will be the losers."
16:110-111	Then indeed, your Lord is for those who emigrated after they were persecuted and then strove and were patient - indeed, your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful. The Day every soul will come disputing for itself, and every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and they will not be wronged.
16:112-113	And God presents an example: a town that was safe and secure, its provision coming to it in abundance from every location, but it denied the favors of God. So God made it taste the envelopment of hunger and fear for what they used to do. And there had already come to them a messenger from among themselves, but they denied him, so the punishment seized them while they were wrongdoers.
16:114-119	"So eat of what Allah has provided for you [which is] lawful and good, and be grateful for the favor of Allah, if it is Him that you worship. He has only forbidden you dead animals, blood, the flesh of swine, and that which has been dedicated to other than Allah. But whoever is forced [by necessity], neither desiring [it] nor transgressing [its limits] - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And do not say about what your tongues put forth falsely, ""This is lawful"" and ""this is unlawful,"" inventing a lie about Allah. Indeed, those who invent a lie about Allah will not succeed. [This is] a brief enjoyment, and theirs is a painful punishment. And as for the Jews, We did forbid what We related to you before. And We did not wrong them, but they were wronging themselves. Then indeed, your Lord is to those who did evil in ignorance and then repented after that and reformed - indeed, your Lord, after that, is Forgiving and Merciful."
16:120-124	Indeed, Abraham was a nation obedient to Allah, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah. He was grateful for His blessings. He chose him and guided him to a straight path. And We gave him good in this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. Then We revealed to you, [O Muhammad], [saying], “Follow the religion of Abraham, inclining toward truth, and he was not of those who associate others with Allah.” The Sabbath was only made obligatory for those who differed therein. And indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ.
16:125-128	Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided. And if you punish, punish with the equivalent of that with which you were afflicted. But if you are patient, it is better for the patient. And be patient, and your patience is not but through Allah. And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they plot. Indeed, Allah is with those who fear Him and those who are doers of good.
17:1-1	Glory be to Him who took His servant by night from al-Masjid al-Haram to al-Masjid al-Aqsa, whose surroundings We have blessed, to show him of Our signs. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Seeing.
17:2-8	And We gave Moses the Scripture and made it a guidance for the Children of Israel, “Do not take besides Me a guardian.” [The descendants of those We carried with Noah. Indeed, he was a grateful servant.] And We decreed to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, “You will surely cause corruption on the earth twice, and you will surely reach [a state of] great haughtiness.” But when the promise of the first of the two came, We sent against you servants of Ours of great might, and they penetrated into the dwellings, and it was a promise fulfilled. Then We gave you back the upper hand over them and reinforced you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower. If you do good, you do good for yourselves, and if you do evil, you do it to yourselves. But when the promise of the last comes, they will disfigure your faces and enter the temple as they entered it the first time and destroy with utter destruction what they had exalted. Perhaps your Lord will have mercy upon you. But if you return [to evil], We will return [to evil] and make Hell, for the disbelievers, a prison.
17:9-11	Indeed, this Qur’an guides to that which is most upright and gives good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a great reward. And that those who do not believe in the Hereafter - We have prepared for them a painful punishment. And man invokes evil as he invokes good, and ever is man hasty.
17:12-17	"And We have made the night and the day two signs, and We erased the sign of the night and made the sign of the day visible - that you may seek bounty from your Lord and that you may know the number of years and account. And We have detailed all things in detail. And We have fastened every person's fate to his neck, and We will produce for him on the Day of Resurrection a book which he will find wide open. [Saying], ""Read your record. Sufficient is yourself this Day as accountant against you. Whoever is guided is only guided for his own soul, and whoever goes astray only goes astray to its detriment. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And We never punish until We have sent a messenger. And when We desire to destroy a city, We command its affluent ones, but they defiantly disobey therein; so the word comes into effect upon it, and We destroy it with [complete] destruction. And how many generations have We destroyed after Noah? And sufficient is your Lord, concerning the sins of His servants, as Acquainted and Seeing."
17:18-21	Whoever desires the immediate, We hasten for him from it what We will for whom We intend. Then We have assigned for him Hell, which he will burn, blamed and expelled. But whoever desires the Hereafter and strives for it with the necessary effort while he is a believer - for those, their effort is ever appreciated. Both - We provide for these and those from the gift of your Lord, and the gift of your Lord is not restricted. See how We have preferred some over others. And the Hereafter is greater in degrees and greater in preference.
17:22-30	"Do not make with Allah another god, lest you sit down blamed and forsaken. And your Lord has decreed that you not worship except Him, and to parents, good treatment. Whether one or both of them attain old age [while] with you, say not to them a word of disrespect, nor repel them but address them with a generous word. And lower to them the wing of humility out of mercy and say, ""My Lord, have mercy upon them as they brought me up [when I was] small."" Your Lord is most knowing of what is within your souls. If you should be righteous - then indeed, He is ever, to the frequently turning [to Him], Forgiving. And give to the relative his right and [also] the needy and the traveler. And spend not wastefully. Indeed, the wasteful are brothers of the devils, and ever has Satan been to his Lord ungrateful. But if you turn away from them, seeking mercy from your Lord which you hope for, then speak to them a gentle word. And do not make your hand [as] chained to your neck nor stretch it forth completely [into submission], lest you sit down blamed and destitute. Indeed, your Lord extends provision to whom He wills and restricts it. Indeed, He is ever, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing."
17:31-35	And do not kill your children for fear of poverty. We will provide for them and for you. Indeed, their killing is ever a great sin. And do not come near unlawful sexual intercourse. Indeed, it is ever an immorality and an evil way. And do not kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right. And whoever is killed unjustly - We have given his heir authority, but let him not exceed limits in [the matter of] taking life. Indeed, he has been supported. And do not approach the property of an orphan, except in a way that is best, until he reaches maturity. And fulfill [all] covenants. Indeed, covenants will be questioned about. And give full measure when you measure, and weigh with a straight balance. That is better and more suitable in [the final] outcome.
17:36-39	And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge. Indeed, the hearing, the sight and the heart - about all those one will be questioned. And do not walk upon the earth exultantly. Indeed, you will never tear the earth apart, and you will never reach the mountains in height. All that is ever evil in the sight of your Lord, hateful. That is from what your Lord has revealed to you of wisdom. And do not set up with Allah another deity [i.e., Allah], lest you be thrown into Hell, blameworthy and banished.
17:40-44	Has your Lord chosen you for sons and taken for Himself daughters from among the angels? Indeed, you are saying a terrible word. And We have certainly diversified in this Qur’an that they may be reminded, but it only increases them in aversion. Say, “If there had been with Him gods as they say, then they would have sought a way to the Lord of the Throne.” Glory be to Him and He is far above what they say, far exalted. The seven heavens and the earth and whoever is in them exalt Him. And there is not a thing but exalts Him with praise, but you do not understand their exaltation. Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving.
17:45-48	"And when you recite the Qur'an, We place between you and those who do not believe in the Hereafter an invisible veil. And We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And when you mention your Lord alone in the Qur'an, they turn their backs in aversion. We are most knowing of what they listen to when they listen to you, and when they are in private conversation, when the wrongdoers say, ""You follow none but a man bewitched."" See how they strike for you examples, but they have gone astray and are unable to find a way."
17:49-52	And they say, “When we are bones and dust, shall we indeed be resurrected as a new creation?” Say, “Be you stones or iron, or a creation of whatever is greater within your breasts.” And they will say, “Who will restore us?” Say, “He who created you the first time.” And they will shake their heads at you and say, “When is that?” Say, “Perhaps it will be near.” The Day He will call you, and you will respond with His praise and think that you remained only a little.
17:53-56	"And tell My servants to say that which is best. Indeed, Satan induces dissension among them. Indeed Satan has ever been to man a clear enemy. Your Lord is most knowing of you. If He wills, He will have mercy upon you; or if He wills, He will punish you. And We have not sent you over them as a guardian. And your Lord is most knowing of who is in the heavens and the earth. And We have certainly preferred some prophets over others, and We gave David the Psalms. Say, ""Call upon those you claim besides Him; they do not possess the power to remove distress from you, nor to transfer [anything]."""
17:57-58	Those who call upon Allah, seeking a means of approach to their Lord - which of them is nearest - and they hope for His mercy and fear His punishment. Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is ever to be feared. And there is no city but that We will destroy it before the Day of Resurrection or punish it with a severe punishment. That is ever inscribed in the Book.
17:59-60	"And nothing prevented Us from sending signs except that the former peoples denied them. And We gave Thamud the she-camel as a visible sign, but they wronged her. And We send the signs only as a warning. And when We said to you, ""Indeed, your Lord encompasses the people."" And We made the vision which We showed you only a trial for the people and [also] the accursed tree in the Qur'an. And We frighten them, but it only increases them in great transgression."
17:61-65	"And remember when We said to the angels, ""Prostrate to Adam,"" and they prostrated, except for Iblis. He said, ""Should I prostrate to one You created from clay?"" He said, ""Have you seen this one You have honored above me? If You should delay me until the Day of Resurrection, I will surely destroy his descendants, all but a few."" He said, ""Go! And whoever of them follows you, indeed, Hell will be your recompense - an ample recompense. And incite whomever you can among them with your voice and assault them with your cavalry and infantry and share with them in wealth and children and make promises to them. But Satan does not promise them except delusion. Indeed, over My servants you have no authority. And sufficient is your Lord as Disposer of affairs."""
17:66-70	Your Lord is He who drives the ship for you through the sea that you may seek of His bounty. Indeed, He is to you Merciful. And when harm touches you at sea, lost are those you invoke except Him. But when He brings you safe to land, you turn away. And ever is man ungrateful. Do you then feel secure that He will not cause a part of the land to swallow you up or send upon you a violent storm, then you would not find for yourself a protector? Or do you feel secure that He will not return you into it another time and send upon you a violent storm of wind and drown you because you disbelieved, then you would not find for yourself against Us any protector for it? And We have certainly honored the children of Adam and carried them on the land and sea and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over much of what We have created, with [definite] preference.
17:71-77	The Day We will call every people with their leader. Then whoever is given his record in his right hand - those will read their record, and they will not be wronged a thread. And whoever is blind in this [world] will be blind in the Hereafter and even more astray from the way. And indeed they almost tempted you away from that which We revealed to you in order that you might invent something else about Us. And in that case they would have taken you as a friend. And had We not strengthened you, you would have almost inclined to them a little. Then We would have made you taste double [the punishment of] life and double [the punishment of] death. Then you would not have found for yourself against Us any helper. And indeed they almost tempted you to leave the land in order to expel you from it. And in that case they would not remain [following] you except a little. [This is] the way of those of Our messengers We sent before you, and you will not find in Our way any change.
17:78-82	Establish prayer at the decline of the sun until the darkness of the night and [also] recite the Qur’an at dawn. Indeed, the recitation of the Qur’an at dawn is ever witnessed. And during part of the night, pray with it as an additional prayer for you. Perhaps your Lord will raise you to a position of praise. And say, “My Lord, let me enter an entrance of truth and let me exit an exit of truth and grant me from Yourself a supporting authority.” And say, “The truth has come, and falsehood has perished. Indeed, falsehood is [bound to] perish.” And We send down of the Qur’an that which is healing and mercy for the believers, but it does not increase the wrongdoers except in loss.
17:83-87	"And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself; but when evil touches him, he is despairing. Say, ""Each one acts according to his nature. But your Lord is most knowing of who is best guided in the way."" And they ask you about the spirit. Say, ""The spirit is of the affair of my Lord. And of knowledge you have not been given except a little. And if We willed, We could surely take away that which We have revealed to you, then you would not find for yourself concerning it a protector against Us - except for the mercy of your Lord. Indeed, His favor upon you has ever been great."""
17:88-89	"Say, ""If mankind and the jinn gathered in order to produce the like of this Qur'an, they could not produce the like of it, even if they were to each other assistants."" And We have certainly presented for the people in this Qur'an from every [kind of] example, but most of the people refuse except disbelief."
17:90-96	"And they said, ""We will not believe in you until you cause a spring to gush forth for us from the earth, or you have a garden of palm trees and grapes and cause rivers to gush forth within it abundantly, or you cause the sky to fall upon us in fragments, as you claim, or you bring Allah and the angels before you, or you have a house of gold or you ascend into the heaven. And we will not believe in your ascension until you bring down to us a book that we can read."" Say, ""Glory be to my Lord! Are you anything but a human messenger?"" And nothing prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them except that they said, ""Has Allah sent a human messenger?"" Say, ""If there were upon the earth angels walking securely, We would have sent down to them from the heaven an angel as a messenger."" Say, ""Sufficient is Allah as a Witness between me and you. Indeed, He is ever, of His servants, Acquainted and Seeing."""
17:97-100	"And he whom Allah guides - he is the one who is guided. And he whom He leaves astray - you will not find for them any protectors besides Him. And We will gather them on the Day of Resurrection on their faces - blind, dumb and deaf. Their refuge is Hell. Every time it subsides, We increase them in Blaze. That is their recompense because they disbelieved in Our verses and said, ""When we are bones and crumbs, will we indeed be resurrected as a new creation?"" Do they not see that Allah, who created the heavens and the earth, is able to create the likes of them and has appointed for them a term about which there is no doubt? But the wrongdoers refuse except disbelief. Say, ""If you possessed the treasures of the mercy of my Lord, then you would withhold for fear of spending."" And man is ever niggardly."
17:101-104	"And We had given Moses nine clear signs, so ask the Children of Israel when he came to them and Pharaoh said to him, ""Indeed, I think, O Moses, you are affected by magic."" He said, ""Indeed, you know that none has sent down these [signs] except the Lord of the heavens and the earth as insight. And indeed, I think, O Pharaoh, that you are doomed."" So he intended to expel them from the land, but We drowned him and all who were with him. And We said after him to the Children of Israel, ""Dwell in the land, but when the promise of the Hereafter comes to pass, We will bring you forth in a mixed crowd."""
17:105-111	And with the truth We have sent it down, and with the truth it has descended. And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And [this is] a Qur’an which We have divided into parts in order that you may recite it to the people over a period of time. And We have revealed it by progressive revelation. Say, “Believe in it or do not believe.” Indeed, those who were given knowledge before it, when it is recited to them, fall upon their faces in prostration and say, “Glory be to our Lord. Indeed, the promise of our Lord has been fulfilled.” And they fall upon their faces weeping, and it increases them in humility. Say, “Call upon Allah or call upon the Most Merciful. Whichever [name] you call upon, to Him belong the best names. And do not recite your prayer aloud, nor be in a low voice therein, but seek between that a way. And say, “Praise be to Allah, who has not taken a son and has not had a partner in dominion and has not had a protector out of weakness.” And glorify Him with all glorification.
18:1-6	"Praise be to Allah, who has sent down to His Servant the Book and has not made therein any crookedness - straight - to warn of a severe punishment from Him and to give good tidings to the believers who do righteous deeds that they will have a good reward, abiding therein forever. And to warn those who say, ""Allah has taken a son."" They have no knowledge of that, nor did their fathers. Grave is the word that comes out of their mouths. They speak nothing but a lie. So perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them, if they do not believe in this message."
18:7-8	Indeed, We have made what is on the earth adornment for it that We may test them as to which of them is best in deed. And indeed, We will make what is on it [another] barren plain.
18:9-16	"Or do you think that the People of the Cave and the Inscription were, among Our signs, a wonder? When the youths took refuge in the cave and said, ""Our Lord, grant us from Yourself mercy and prepare for us from our affair right guidance."" So We sealed their ears within the cave for a number of years. Then We raised them up that We might test which of the two parties would best calculate the term that they had tarried. We relate to you, [O Muhammad], their story in truth. Indeed, they were youths who believed in their Lord, and We increased them in guidance. And We strengthened their hearts when they stood up and said, ""Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth. Never will we invoke besides Him any deity. We would have certainly spoken insolently then."" These are our people; they have taken gods besides Him. Why do they not produce for them a clear authority? Who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah? And when you withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah, then take refuge in the Cave. Your Lord will spread out for you from His mercy and will prepare for you from your affair ease."
18:17-20	"And you would see the sun, when it rose, inclining away from their cave on the right, and when it set, passing by them on the left, while they were in an open space thereof. That is from the signs of Allah. He whom Allah guides - he is the one who is guided, and he whom He sends astray - you will not find for him a protector to guide him. And you would think them awake, while they are asleep. And We turned them on the right and on the left, and their dog was stretching out his forelegs at the entrance. If you had looked at them, you would have turned away from them in flight, and you would have been filled with terror of them. And thus We raised them up that they might question one another. One of them said, ""How long have you remained?"" They said, ""We have remained a day or part of a day."" They said, ""Your Lord is most knowing of how long you have remained. So send one of you with this silver of yours to the city and let him see which of it has the best food, and let him bring you provision from it and let him be gentle and not let anyone inform you of you. Indeed, if they gain victory over you, they will stone you or return you to their religion. And never will you succeed then, ever."""
18:21-22	"And thus We caused them to find themselves, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about the Hour, when they disputed among themselves about their affair and said, ""Construct over them a structure."" Their Lord is most knowing of them. Those who prevailed in their affair said, ""We will surely take over them a mosque."" They will say, ""Three, with their dog as their fourth."" And they will say, ""Five, with their dog as their sixth,"" guessing at the unseen. And they will say, ""Seven, with their dog as their eighth."" Say, ""My Lord is most knowing of their number. None knows them except a few."" So do not dispute about them except with an outward dispute, and do not consult anyone of them about them."
18:23-24	"And never say of anything, ""I will do that tomorrow,"" except [in the event], ""If Allah wills."" And remember your Lord when you forget and say, ""Perhaps my Lord will guide me to something nearer than this in right conduct."""
18:25-26	"And they remained in their cave three hundred years, and added nine. Say, ""God knows best how long they remained. To Him belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth. He sees and hears it. They have not besides Him any protector, and He does not share in His rule anyone."""
18:27-28	And recite what has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is no changing His words, and you will never find besides Him a refuge. And keep yourself patient with those who call upon their Lord morning and evening, seeking His countenance. And let not your eyes pass beyond them, desiring adornments of the worldly life. And do not obey one whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance and who follows his desire and whose affair is ever in neglect.
18:29-31	"And say, ""The truth is from your Lord. So whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve."" Indeed, We have prepared for the wrongdoers a Fire whose walls will encompass them. And if they call for relief, they will be relieved with water like murky oil, which will scald their faces. Evil is the drink, and evil is the resting place. Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - never will We allow to be lost the reward of any who did well in deeds. For those are Gardens of Eden, beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and will wear green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade, reclining therein on couches. Excellent is the reward and excellent is the resting place."
18:32-44	"And present to them an example: two men: We made for one of them two gardens of grapevines, and surrounded them with palm trees, and placed between them crops. Both gardens produced their fruit, and you did not fail to do so, and We caused a river to gush forth within them. And he had fruit, so he said to his companion while he was conversing with him, ""I am greater than you in wealth and stronger in men."" And he entered his garden while he was wronging himself. He said, ""I do not think that this will ever perish, nor do I think that the Hour will occur. And if I am returned to my Lord, I will surely find better than it as a return."" His companion said to him while he was conversing with him, ""Have you disbelieved in He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then proportioned you as a man? But He is Allah, my Lord, and I associate none with my Lord."" And why, when you entered your garden, did you not say, ""What Allah wills; there is no power except with Allah."" If you see that I am less than you in wealth and children? But perhaps my Lord will give me better than your garden and send upon it a reckoning from the sky and it will become a slippery ground, or its water will become sunken, so that you will not be able to seek it. And his fruits were surrounded, so he began to turn his hands over what he had spent on it, while it lay empty on its trellises, and he said, “Oh, I wish I had not associated anyone with my Lord.” And he had no group to aid him other than God, nor could he be victorious. There is guardianship for God, the Truth. He is the best in reward and the best in outcome."
18:45-46	And present to them the example of the life of this world: it is like water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it and then becomes dry straw which the winds scatter. And ever is God over all things competent. Wealth and children are the adornment of the life of this world. But the lasting righteous deeds are better in the sight of your Lord for reward and better for hope.
18:47-49	"And the Day We set the mountains in motion and you see the earth barren and We gather them and do not leave out one of them. And they are presented before your Lord in rows, [saying], ""You have certainly come to Us as We created you the first time. Rather, you claimed, 'Will We not make for you an appointment?'"" And the record is placed, and you see the criminals fearful of that within it, and they say, ""Oh, woe to us! What is this record that leaves nothing small or great but that it has enumerated it?"" And they will find what they did present. And your Lord does not wrong anyone."
18:50-53	"And when We said to the angels, ""Prostrate to Adam,"" and they prostrated, except for Iblis. He was one of the jinn and disobeyed the command of his Lord. Then will you take him and his descendants as allies instead of Me while they are to you an enemy? An evil exchange for the wrongdoers. I did not make them witness to the creation of the heavens and the earth or to the creation of themselves, nor would I have taken the misguiders as assistants. And the Day He will say, ""Call upon My associates whom you claim,"" and they will call upon them, but they will not respond to them. And We placed between them a barrier of destruction. And the criminals will see the Fire and think that they are going to fall into it, but they will find no escape from it."
18:54-56	And We have certainly presented for the people in this Qur'an from every [kind of] example, but man has ever been, most of anything, argumentative. And nothing prevented the people from believing when guidance came to them and from asking forgiveness of their Lord except that there should come to them the precedent of the former peoples or that the punishment should come to them beforehand. And We do not send the messengers except as bringers of good tidings and warners. And those who disbelieve argue with falsehood to invalidate thereby the truth, and they take My verses and that with which they are warned in ridicule.
18:57-59	And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the verses of his Lord but turns away from them and forgets what his hands have put forth? Indeed, We have placed over their hearts coverings, lest they understand it, and in their ears deafness. And if you should invite them to guidance, they will never be guided. And your Lord is the Forgiving, the Possessor of Mercy. If He were to impose blame upon them for what they have earned, He would have hastened for them the punishment. Rather, for them is an appointed time from which they will not find any refuge. And those cities - We destroyed them when they wronged, and We appointed for their destruction an appointed time.
18:60-77	"And remember when Moses said to his boy, ""I will not cease until I reach the junction of the two seas, or I will continue for a long time."" But when they reached the junction of the two, they forgot their fish, and it took its way into the sea, slipping away. But when they had passed, he said to his boy, ""Bring us our breakfast. We have certainly suffered from this our journey, [and] none made me forget to mention it except Satan, and it took its way into the sea, astonishing."" He said, ""That is what we were seeking."" So they returned, following in their footsteps, telling stories. Then they found a servant from among Our servants to whom We had given mercy from Us and had taught him knowledge from Us. Moses said to him, ""Shall I follow you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught of sound judgment?"" He said, ""Indeed, you will never be able to have patience with me. And how can you be patient about that of which you have not encompassed knowledge?"" He said, ""You will find me, if Allah wills, patient, and I will not disobey you in anything."" He said, ""Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I make mention of it to you."" So they set out, until, when they embarked in the ship, he pierced it. He said, ""Have you pierced it to drown its people? You have certainly done a terrible thing."" He said, ""Did I not tell you that you would never be able to have patience with me?"" He said, ""Do not hold me accountable for what I forgot and do not overburden me with my affair."" So they set out, until when they met a boy, he killed him. He said, ""Have you killed a pure soul without a soul? You have certainly done a horrible thing."" He said, ""Did I not tell you that you would never be able to have patience with me?"" He said, ""If I ask you about anything after this, do not keep me company; you have received from me an excuse."" So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to entertain them. They found therein a wall about to collapse, so he restored it. He said, ""If you had wished, you could have taken payment for it."""
18:78-82	"He said, ""This is parting between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that over which you could not have patience. As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea, and I intended to fault it, but behind them was a king who seized every ship by force. As for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would overburden them through transgression and disbelief. So we intended that their Lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to kinship. As for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and beneath it was their treasure. Their father had been a righteous man. So your Lord intended that they should reach maturity and extract their treasure - a mercy from your Lord. And I did not do it of my own accord. That is the interpretation of that over which you could not have patience."""
18:83-89	"They ask you, [O Muhammad], about Dhul-Qarnayn. Say, ""I will recite to you a report about him. Indeed, We established him upon the earth, and We gave him from all things a way."" So he followed a way. Until, when he reached the setting of the sun, he found it setting in a spring of murky water. And he found near it a people. We said, ""O Dhul-Qarnayn, either you punish them or deal with them kindly."" He said, ""As for he who wronged, We will punish him; then he will be returned to his Lord, and He will punish him with a terrible punishment. But as for he who believed and did righteousness, he will have the best reward, and We will speak to him from Our command [something] easy."" Then he followed a way."
18:90-98	"Until, when he reached the rising of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We had not made against it a covering. Thus We encompassed what he had with knowledge. Then he followed a way. Until, when he reached between the two barriers, he found against them a people who could scarcely understand a word. They said, ""O Dhul-Qarnayn, indeed Gog and Magog are corrupters in the land. Shall we assign to you an expenditure on condition that you make between us and them a barrier?"" He said, ""That in which my Lord has established me is better, so aid me with strength; I will make between you and them a barrier."" Bring me sheets of iron. Until, when he had leveled between the two mountain-sides, he said, ""Blow."" Until, when he had made it fire, he said, ""Bring me molten copper that I may pour over it."" But they were not able to surpass it, nor were they able to pierce it. He said, ""This is a mercy from my Lord. But when the promise of my Lord comes to pass, He will make it level. And ever is the promise of my Lord true."""
18:99-106	"And We will let some of them surge against others, and the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather them together. And We will present Hell that Day to the disbelievers, plainly. Those whose eyes were covered from My remembrance, and they were unable to hear. Then do those who disbelieve think that they can take My servants as protectors other than Me? Indeed, We have prepared Hell for the disbelievers as a lodging. Say, ""Shall We inform you of the greatest losers as to [their] deeds?"" Those whose effort is lost in worldly life, while they think that they are doing well in work. Those are the ones who disbelieved in the verses of their Lord and in the meeting with Him, so their deeds have become worthless, so We will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight. That is their recompense - Hell, for what they disbelieved and took My verses and My messengers in ridicule."
18:107-108	Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have the Gardens of Paradise as an accommodation. They will abide therein eternally, never desiring to depart from it.
18:109-110	"Say, ""If the sea were ink for the words of my Lord, the sea would be exhausted before the words of my Lord were exhausted, even if We brought the like of it as a supplement."" Say, ""I am only a human being like you, to whom it has been revealed that your God is one God. So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord - let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his Lord anyone."""
19:1-11	"Kaf Ha Ya Ain Sad. A mention of the mercy of your Lord to His servant Zechariah, when he called upon his Lord in a secret call. He said, ""My Lord, indeed my bones have weakened, and my head has gleamed with gray hair, and I have never been in my supplication to You, my Lord, unhappy. And indeed, I fear my relatives after me, and my wife has been barren. So grant me from Yourself an heir who will inherit me and inherit from the family of Jacob, and make him, my Lord, one pleasing to You."" O Zechariah, indeed We give you good tidings of a boy whose name will be John. We have not given anyone before any namesake. He said, ""My Lord, how can I have a boy while my wife is barren, and I have reached extreme old age?"" He said, ""Thus said your Lord: It is easy for Me, and I created you before, while you were nothing."" He said, ""My Lord, appoint for me a sign."" He said, ""Your sign is that you will not speak to the people for three nights, sound."" So he came out to his people from the sanctuary and inspired them to glorify God morning and evening."
19:12-15	O Yahya, take the Scripture with determination. And We gave him judgement while yet a boy, and compassion from Us and purity. And he was righteous. And dutiful to his parents, and he was not a disobedient tyrant. And peace be upon him the day he was born and the day he dies and the day he is raised alive.
19:16-33	"And mention in the Book, Mary, when she withdrew from her family to a place in the East. And she took a veil apart from them. Then We sent to her Our Spirit, and he appeared to her as a well-proportioned man. She said, ""Indeed, I seek refuge in the Most Gracious from you, if you should fear Allah."" He said, ""I am only the messenger of your Lord to give you a pure boy."" She said, ""How can I have a boy when no man has touched me, nor have I been unchaste?"" He said, ""Thus says your Lord: 'It is easy for Me, and We will make him a sign to the people and a mercy from Us, and it is a matter [already] decreed.'"" So she conceived him and withdrew with him to a remote place. Then the pangs of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a palm tree. She said, ""Oh, I wish I had died before this and was in oblivion, forgotten."" Then he called to her from beneath her, ""Do not grieve; your Lord has provided beneath you a stream. And shake toward you the trunk of the palm tree; it will drop upon you ripe, fresh dates. So eat and drink and be refreshed. But if you see any human being, say, ""Indeed, I have vowed to the Most Gracious a fast, so I will not speak to any human being today."" So she brought him to her people, carrying him. They said, ""O Mary, you have certainly done a thing unprecedented. O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste."" So she pointed to him. They said, ""How can we speak to one who is in the cradle, a child?"" He said, ""Indeed, I am a servant of Allah. He has given me the Scripture and made me a prophet. And He has made me blessed wherever I am. And He has enjoined upon me prayer and zakah as long as I live. And He has been dutiful to my mother and has not made me a wretched tyrant. And peace be upon me the day I was born and the day I die and the day I am raised alive."""
19:34-40	"That is Jesus, the son of Mary - the statement of truth about which they are in dispute. It is not for Allah to take a son - glory be to Him! When He decrees a matter, He only says to it, ""Be,"" and it is. And indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path. But the factions differed among themselves. So woe to those who disbelieve from the sight of a tremendous Day. I will hear of them and see the Day when they come to Us. But the wrongdoers, Today, are in manifest error. And warn them of the Day of Regret when the matter is decreed, while they are in heedlessness, and they will not believe. Indeed, it is We who will inherit the earth and whoever is on it, and to Us they will be returned."
19:41-50	"And mention in the Book, Abraham. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet. When he said to his father, ""O my father, why do you worship that which does not hear and does not see and does not avail you at all? O my father, indeed there has come to me of knowledge that which has not come to you, so follow me; I will guide you to a straight path."" O my father, do not worship Satan. Indeed, Satan has ever been disobedient to the Most Merciful. O my father, indeed I fear that a punishment from the Most Merciful will afflict you, and you would be an ally of Satan."" He said, ""Are you averse to my gods, O Abraham? If you do not desist, I will surely stone you, and leave me for a long time."" He said, ""Peace be upon you. I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, He is ever Gracious to me. And I will leave you and what you invoke besides Allah and call upon my Lord. Perhaps I will not be, in my invocation of my Lord, unhappy."" So when he had left them and what they worshipped besides Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob, and each of them We made a prophet. And We bestowed upon them of Our mercy and made for them a reputation of truth, high."
19:51-58	And mention in the Book, Moses. Indeed, he was chosen, and he was a messenger and a prophet. And We called to him from the right side of the Mount and brought him near for confidential talk. And We bestowed on him, out of Our mercy, his brother Aaron, a prophet. And mention in the Book, Ishmael. Indeed, he was true to his promise, and he was a messenger and a prophet. And he used to enjoin prayer and zakah upon his people, and he was to his Lord acceptable. And mention in the Book, Idris. Indeed, he was a man of truth and a prophet. And We raised him to a high station. Those are the ones upon whom Allah bestowed favor from the prophets, from the descendants of Adam and from those We carried with Noah and from the descendants of Abraham and Israel and from those We guided and chose. When the verses of the Most Merciful were recited to them, they fell down prostrating and weeping.
19:59-65	Then there came after them an evil generation who neglected prayer and pursued desires. So they are going to meet destruction - Except for those who repent, believe and do righteousness. For those will enter Paradise and not be wronged at all. Gardens of Eden which the Most Merciful has promised to His servants in the unseen. Indeed, His promise is ever fulfilled. They will hear therein no ill speech but only [saying], “Peace.” And they will have their provision therein, morning and evening. That is Paradise which We will inherit from those of Our servants who were righteous. And We do not descend except by the command of your Lord. To Him belongs what is before us and what is behind us and what is between that. And your Lord is not forgetful. He is the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them. So worship Him and be patient in His worship. Do you know of any other similar to Him?
19:66-72	"And man says, ""When I die, will I then be brought forth alive?"" Does man not remember that We created him before, while he was nothing? Then by your Lord, We will surely gather them and the devils; then We will surely present them around Hell, on their knees. Then We will extract from every sect those of them who were most rebellious against the Most Merciful. Then We are most knowing of those who are most deserving of burning therein. And there is not one of you but will pass over it; this is upon your Lord an inevitability decreed. Then We will save those who feared God and leave the wrongdoers therein, on their knees."
19:73-76	"And when Our clear verses are recited to them, those who disbelieve say to those who believe, ""Which of the two parties is better in position and better in company?"" And how many generations before them have We destroyed who were better in possessions and appearance. Say, ""Whoever is in error - let the Most Merciful extend to him a term until, when they see that which they are promised - either the punishment or the Hour - they will know who is worse in position and weaker in soldiers. And Allah increases those who are guided in guidance. And the lasting good deeds are better in the sight of your Lord for reward and better for outcome."""
19:77-87	Have you seen he who disbelieved in Our verses and said, “I will surely be given wealth and children.” Has he known the unseen, or has he taken a covenant from the Most Merciful? No! We will record what he says, and We will extend for him a period of punishment. And We will inherit from him what he says, and he will come to Us alone. And they have taken besides Allah deities that they may be a means of honor to them. No! They will deny their worship of them and will be opponents to them. Have you not seen that We have sent the devils upon the disbelievers, inciting them to a terrible intimidation? So be not impatient against them. We are only counting for them a number. The Day We will gather the righteous to the Most Merciful as a delegation, and We will drive the criminals to Hell in droves. They will not possess intercession, except for he who has taken a covenant from the Most Merciful.
19:88-95	"And they say, ""The Most Merciful has taken a son."" You have certainly committed a thing monstrous. The heavens almost burst therefrom and the earth splits open and the mountains collapse in devastation - that they attribute to the Most Merciful a son. And it is not befitting for the Most Merciful that He should take a son. There is none in the heavens and earth but comes to the Most Merciful as a servant. He has enumerated them and counted them [completely]. And all of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone."
19:96-98	Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds - the Most Merciful will appoint for them affection. And indeed, We have only made it easy for you in your language that you may give good tidings thereby to the righteous and warn thereby a hostile people. And how many generations before them have We destroyed! Do you perceive anyone of them or hear a whisper from them?
20:1-8	Ta-Ha. We have not sent down the Qur’an to you to cause you distress, but only as a reminder for those who fear [Allah]. A revelation from He who created the earth and the high heavens. The Most Gracious established Himself firmly on the Throne. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and whatever is between them and whatever is under the soil. And if you speak aloud, then indeed, He knows the secret and what is even more hidden. Allah - there is no deity except Him. To Him belong the best names.
20:9-16	"Has there reached you the story of Moses? When he saw a fire, he said to his family, ""Stay here; I have perceived a fire; perhaps I can bring you a torch from it or find at the fire some guidance."" But when he came to it, he was called, ""O Moses, indeed I am your Lord, so remove your sandals. Indeed, you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa. And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed to me. Indeed, I am Allah; there is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance. Indeed, the Hour is coming - I almost conceal it - so that every soul may be rewarded for what it strives for."" So do not let those who do not believe in it avert you from it and follow their desires, lest you perish."
20:17-24	And what is that in your right hand, O Moses? He said, “It is my staff; I lean upon it, and with it I beat down branches for my sheep, and I have other uses for it.” He said, “Throw it down, O Moses.” So he threw it down, and behold, it was a serpent, darting about. He said, “Take it and fear not. We will restore it to its former state. And put your hand into your side; it will emerge white without disease - another sign - that We may show you some of Our greater signs. Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed.”
20:25-37	"He said, ""My Lord, expand for me my chest and ease for me my task and untie the knot from my tongue that they may understand my speech. And appoint for me a helper from my family - Aaron, my brother. Strengthen my strength through him and let him share my task - that we may glorify You much and remember You much. Indeed, You are ever, over us, Seeing."" He said, ""Your request has been granted, O Moses. And We have certainly conferred favor upon you another time."""
20:38-48	"When We inspired your mother with what was inspired, [saying], ""Cast him into the chest, and cast him into the river, and let the river cast him upon the shore. An enemy of Mine and an enemy of his will take him. And I bestowed upon you love from Me, that you may be brought up under My eye."" When your sister walked, she said, ""Shall I direct you to one who will take care of him?"" So We returned you to your mother that her eye might be cooled and she would not grieve. And you killed a person, but We saved you from distress and tried you with a trial, and you remained among the people of Midian for years; then you came [to the world] according to a [determined] measure. O Moses! And I have chosen you for Myself. Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not slacken in remembering Me. Go to Pharaoh, for he has transgressed. And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear."" They said, ""Our Lord, indeed we fear that he will assault us or that he will transgress."" He said, ""Do not fear; indeed, I am with you, hearing and seeing."" So go to him and say, ""Indeed, we are messengers of your Lord, so send the Children of Israel with us and do not punish them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord, and peace be upon him who follows guidance."" Indeed, it has been revealed to us that the punishment is upon those who deny and turn away."
20:49-55	"He said, ""Who is your Lord, O Moses?"" He said, ""Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and nature and then guided it."" He said, ""Then what about the former generations?"" He said, ""The knowledge thereof is with my Lord, in a Record. My Lord does not err, nor does He forget. He who made the earth a bed for you and threaded paths for you therein and sent down water from the sky, and We produced thereby diverse pairs of plants. Eat and pasture your livestock. Indeed in that are signs for those of understanding. From it We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time."""
20:56-69	"And We showed him all Our signs, but he denied and refused. He said, ""Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses? But we will bring you magic like it, so make between us and you an appointment which neither we nor you will fail to fulfill - a place apart."" He said, ""Your appointment is the Day of Festivities, and that the people be gathered at forenoon."" So Pharaoh turned away and assembled his plot, then came. Moses said to them, ""Woe to you! Do not invent a lie about Allah, or He will destroy you with a punishment. And he who invents a lie has failed."" So they disputed their affair among themselves and spoke secretly. They said, ""Indeed, these two are magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your best way. So assemble your plot and come in ranks, and today he has succeeded who has gained supremacy."" They said, ""O Moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw."" He said, ""Rather, throw."" And at once their ropes and their staffs appeared to him from their magic as if they were crawling. So Moses felt fear within himself. We said, ""Do not fear; indeed, you are the superior."" And throw down what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have made. What they have made is only the trick of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he goes."
20:70-76	"So the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, ""We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses."" He said, ""You have believed in him before I give you permission. Indeed, he is your chief who taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will surely know which of us has the most severe and lasting punishment."" They said, ""We will never prefer you over the clear proofs that have come to us and He who created us, so decree what you will decree. You can only decree this worldly life. Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you forced us to do of magic. And Allah is better and more lasting. Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal - for him is Hell, he will neither die therein nor live. But whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous deeds - for those will be the highest degrees [in Paradise] - Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the reward of he who purifies himself."""
20:77-79	"And We had already inspired Moses, ""Travel by night with My servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea. You will not fear being overtaken, nor will you be afraid."" But Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, but the sea covered them. And Pharaoh led his people astray, and did not guide them."
20:80-82	O Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy and made an appointment with you at the right side of the Mount and sent down to you manna and quails. Eat from the good things We have provided for you and do not transgress therein, lest My wrath should descend upon you. And whoever incurs My wrath has certainly perished. And indeed, I am Forgiving to whoever repents, believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance.
20:83-85	"And what made you hasten to leave your people, O Moses? He said, ""They are on my heels, and I hastened to You, my Lord, that You might please me."" He said, ""Indeed, we have tested your people after you, and the Samiri has led them astray."""
20:86-94	"Then Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved. He said, ""O my people, did not your Lord promise you a good promise? Has the covenant been prolonged for you? Or did you desire that wrath from your Lord should descend upon you, so you broke your promise to me?"" They said, ""We did not break your promise to you of our own accord, but we were carried with burdens of the adornments of the people and threw them down."" Thus did the Samaritan throw them down. Then he brought out for them a calf, a body that mooed. They said, ""This is your god and the god of Moses, but he has forgotten."" Do they not see that it does not return to them a word and does not possess for them any power to harm or benefit? And Aaron had already said to them before, ""O my people, you are only being tested by it, and your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my command."" They said, ""We will not cease to be devoted to it until Moses returns to us."" He said, ""O Aaron, what prevented you when you saw that they had gone astray? Why did you not follow? Have you disobeyed my command?"" He said, ""O son of my mother, do not seize me by the beard or by the head. Indeed, I feared that you would say, 'You have divided the Children of Israel and did not respect my word.'"""
20:95-98	"He said, ""What is the matter with you, O Samaritan?"" He said, ""I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful from the traces of the Messenger and threw it away. And thus my soul suggested to me."" He said, ""Then go, for in this life you will have the right to say, 'Do not touch me.' And you have an appointment which you will not fail to keep. And look to your god, to whom you have been devoted. We will surely burn him and scatter him into the sea like dust. Your god is only God, other than whom there is no god. He encompasses all things in His knowledge."""
20:99-101	Thus We relate to you some of the news of what had preceded. And We have given you from Us a message. Whoever turns away from it - he will certainly bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection, abiding eternally therein - and evil for them on the Day of Resurrection is the burden.
20:102-113	The Day the Trumpet will be blown, and We will gather the criminals, that Day, blue-eyed. They will whisper to one another, “You remained [in the world] only ten.” We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in way will say, “You remained [in the world] only a day.” And they ask you, [O Muhammad], about the mountains, say, “My Lord will blow them away with a blast.” And He will leave them as a level plain. You will see therein no crookedness or unevenness. That Day they will follow the Caller, with no crookedness in him, and voices will be hushed before the Most Merciful, and you will hear nothing but a whisper. That Day no intercession will benefit except for one to whom the Most Merciful has given permission and whose word He is pleased with. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, but they do not encompass Him in knowledge. And faces will be humbled before the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining, and he will fail who bears injustice. And whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer - he will fear neither injustice nor deprivation. Thus We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur’an and have diversified therein the warnings that perhaps they will fear God or it will cause them to be reminded.
20:114-114	So exalted is God, the King, the Truth. And do not hasten with the Qur’an before its revelation is completed to you, and say, “My Lord, increase me in knowledge.”
20:115-122	"And We had already made a covenant with Adam before, but he forgot, and We found on his part no firm will. And when We said to the angels, ""Prostrate to Adam,"" and they prostrated, except for Iblis. He refused. Then We said, ""O Adam, indeed this is an enemy to you and to your wife, so let him not expel you from Paradise and you become miserable. Indeed, you will neither hunger therein nor be naked, nor thirst therein nor be exposed to the sun."" But Satan whispered to him, saying, ""O Adam, shall I direct you to the tree of immortality and possession that will not decay?"" So they ate from it, and their private parts became apparent to them, and they began to fasten together over themselves from the leaves of Paradise. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray. Then his Lord chose him and turned to him in forgiveness and guided him."
20:123-127	"He said, ""Descend from it, all of you, as enemies to one another. And if there comes to you guidance from Me - whoever follows My guidance will neither go astray nor suffer. But whoever turns away from My remembrance - indeed, he will have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind."" He will say, ""My Lord, why have You gathered me blind while I was seeing?"" He will say, ""Thus did Our signs come to you, and you forgot them; and thus will you be forgotten this Day."" And thus do We recompense he who transgressed and did not believe in the signs of his Lord. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more severe and more lasting."
20:128-132	Have they not been guided by how many generations We destroyed before them who used to walk about in their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs for those of understanding. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord, it would have been an obligation and a specified term. So be patient over what they say and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting, and during periods of the night exalt [Allah] and at the ends of the day that you may be satisfied. And do not extend your eyes toward that by which We have given enjoyment to [some] categories of them - the splendor of the worldly life - by which We test them. And the provision of your Lord is better and more lasting. And enjoin prayer upon your family and be constant therein. We do not ask you for provision; We provide for you, and the [best] outcome is for righteousness.
20:133-135	And they said, “Why does he not bring us a sign from his Lord?” Has there not come to them clear evidence of what was in the former scriptures? And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before this, they would have said, “Our Lord, why did you not send us a messenger so we could have followed Your signs before we were humiliated and disgraced?” Say, “Each is waiting, so wait; you will know who are the companions of the straight path and who are guided.”
21:1-10	The reckoning of mankind has drawn near, while they are in heedlessness turning away. There comes not to them a reminder from their Lord renewed but they listen to it while they are playing. Their hearts are distracted, and those who do wrong whisper secretly, [saying], “Is this not but a human being like you? Then do you approach magic while you see?” He said, “My Lord knows what is said in the heaven and the earth, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing.” Rather, they said, “Confused dreams.” Rather, he has invented it. Rather, he is a poet. So let him bring Us a sign as were sent to the former peoples. No city which We destroyed believed before them - will they believe? And We sent not before you, except men to whom We revealed. So ask the people of the message if you do not know. And We did not make them bodies that did not eat food, nor were they immortal. Then We fulfilled for them the promise and saved them and whom We willed and destroyed the transgressors. Indeed, We have sent down to you a Book in which is your message, so will you not reason?
21:11-15	And how many a city have We destroyed which was unjust, and raised up after it another people. But when they perceived Our punishment, at once they fled from it. [Saying], “Do not run, but return to that in which you were affluent and to your dwellings that you may be questioned.” They will say, “Woe to us! Indeed, we were wrongdoers.” And that continued their cry until We made them a harvest, extinct.
21:16-20	We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in play. If We had intended to take a diversion, We could have taken it from Ourself, if We were to do. Rather, We cast the truth upon falsehood, and it destroys it, and thereupon it departs. And for you is woe for that which you describe. And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth, and those with Him are not too proud to worship Him, nor do they grow weary. They glorify [Allah] night and day, never slackening.
21:21-24	"Or have they taken gods from the earth who spread [the message]? Had there been within the heavens and earth gods besides Allah, they both would have been ruined. So exalted is Allah, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe. He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. Or have they taken gods besides Him? Say, ""Produce your proof."" This is the message of those with me and the message of those before me. But most of them do not know the truth, so they are turning away."
21:25-29	"And We did not send before you any messenger except that We revealed to him, ""There is no deity except Me, so worship Me."" And they said, ""The Most Merciful has taken a son."" Glory be to Him! Rather, they are [but] honored servants. They do not precede Him in speech, and they act by His command. He knows what is before them and what is behind them, and they do not intercede except for him with whom He is pleased, and they are fearful of Him. And whoever among them says, ""I am a god other than Him"" ​​- We will recompense him with Hell. Thus do We recompense the wrongdoers."
21:30-35	Have not those who disbelieve seen that the heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them and made from water every living thing? Then will they not believe? And We placed on the earth firm mountains, lest it should shift with them, and We placed therein broad paths for roads that they might be guided. And We made the sky a protected ceiling, yet they, from Its signs, turn away. And it is He who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon; each, in an orbit, floats. And We did not grant to any human being before you immortality. So if you die, are they the immortal ones? Every soul will taste death. And We test you with evil and with good as trial, and to Us you will be returned.
21:36-41	And when those who disbelieve see you, they take you only in ridicule. “Is this he who mentions your gods?” And they, at the mention of the Most Merciful, are disbelievers. He created man of haste. I will show you My signs, so do not be impatient. And they say, “When will this promise be fulfilled, if you should be truthful?” If only those who disbelieve knew when they will not be able to avert the Fire from their faces or from their backs, nor will they be aided. Rather, it will come upon them suddenly and confound them, so they will not be able to repel it, nor will they be reprieved. And messengers before you were mocked, but that which they used to mock encompassed those who mocked them.
21:42-44	"Say, ""Who protects you by night and by day from the Most Merciful?"" Rather, they, from the remembrance of their Lord, turn away. Or have they gods to protect them other than Us? They cannot help themselves, nor do they keep company with Us. Rather, We provided for these and their fathers until life was prolonged for them. Do they not see that We come to the land, reducing it from its borders? Are they then the predominant?"""
21:45-47	"Say, ""I only warn you by revelation, and the deaf do not hear the call when they are warned. And if a blast of the punishment of your Lord should touch them, they will surely say, ""Woe to us. Indeed, we were wrongdoers."" And We will set up the just scales on the Day of Resurrection, so not a soul will be wronged at all. And if there be [therein] the weight of a mustard seed, We will bring it forth, and sufficient are We as accountants."
21:48-50	And We had certainly given Moses and Aaron the Criterion and a light and a reminder for the righteous - those who fear their Lord unseen and are fearful of the Hour. And this is a blessed message which We have sent down. Then will you deny it?
21:51-68	"And We had already given Abraham his sound judgment before, and We were of him Knowing. When he said to his father and his people, ""What are these statues to which you are devoted?"" They said, ""We found our fathers worshipping them."" He said, ""Indeed, you and your fathers were in manifest error."" They said, ""Have you brought us the truth, or are you of the playful?"" He said, ""Rather, your Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Who created them, and I, to that, am among the witnesses. And by Allah, I will surely destroy your idols after you have turned and departed."" So He made them into fragments, except for their eldest, that perhaps they might return to Him. They said, ""Who has done this to our gods? Indeed, he is among the wrongdoers."" They said, ""We heard a youth mentioning them, whose name is Abraham."" They said, ""Then bring him before the eyes of the people that perhaps they will bear witness."" They said, ""Have you done this to our gods, O Abraham?"" He said, ""Rather, their eldest has done it, so ask them, if they can speak."" So they turned to themselves and said, ""Indeed, you are the wrongdoers."" Then they hung their heads, ""Indeed, you know that these do not speak."" He said, ""Then do you worship besides Allah that which can neither benefit you nor harm you at all?"" Fie upon you and upon what you worship besides God. Will you not reason? They said, ""Burn him and support your gods, if you are to do something."""
21:69-73	"We said, ""O fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham."" And they intended against him a plot, but We made them the greatest losers. And We saved him and Lot to the land which We had blessed for the worlds. And We gave him Isaac and Jacob as an additional gift, and all of them We made righteous. And We made them leaders guiding by Our command. And We inspired in them the doing of good deeds, establishing prayer, and giving zakah, and they were to Us worshippers."
21:74-75	And to Lot We gave him wisdom and knowledge, and We saved him from the city that was committing abominations. Indeed, they were a wicked, wicked people. And We admitted him into Our mercy. Indeed, he was of the righteous.
21:76-77	And Noah, when he called before, and We responded to him and saved him and his family from the great distress. And We gave him victory over the people who denied Our signs. Indeed, they were an evil people, so We drowned them all.
21:78-82	And [mention] David and Solomon, when they gave judgment concerning the field, when the sheep of the people had pastured therein. And We were witness to their judgment. And We gave Solomon understanding thereof, and to each of them We gave judgment and knowledge. And We subjected with David the mountains, to glorify Allah [by singing], and the birds, and We were the Doer. And We taught him the making of coats of mail for you, to protect you from your violence. So will you be grateful? And to Solomon [We subjected] the wind, blowing violently, by his command toward the land which We had blessed. And We are Knowing of all things. And among the devils were some who dived for him and did other work besides that, and We were their guardians.
21:83-86	"And [mention] Job, when he cried to his Lord, ""Indeed, distress has seized me, and You are the Most Merciful of the merciful."" So We responded to him and removed the distress that was upon him and gave him his family and a like number with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for the worshippers. And [mention] Ishmael and Idris and Dhul-Kifl - all were among the patient. And We admitted them to Our mercy. Indeed, they were among the righteous."
21:87-88	"And [mention] Dhul-Nun, when he went off in anger and thought that We would not decree anything upon him, but he called out within the darknesses, ""There is no deity except You; exalted are You. Indeed, I have been of the wrongdoers."" So We responded to him and saved him from the distress. And thus do We save the believers."
21:89-90	"And Zachariah, when he called upon his Lord, ""My Lord, leave me not childless, though You are the Best of inheritors."" So We responded to him and gave him John and made his wife sound for him. Indeed, they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate Us in hope and fear and were to Us humbly submissive."
21:91-91	And she who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her of Our spirit and made her and her son a sign for the worlds.
21:92-95	Indeed, this, your nation, is one nation, and I am your Lord, so worship Me. And they divided their affair among themselves. To Us they will all return. So whoever does righteous deeds while he is a believer - no denial will there be for his effort, and indeed, We are recording it. And it is forbidden for a town which We have destroyed that they should not return.
21:96-100	"Until, when Gog and Magog are let loose, and they swarm from every height. And the true promise draws near, at once the eyes of those who disbelieve will be staring [in horror], ""Woe to us! We were indeed heedless of this. Rather, we were wrongdoers."" Indeed, you and those you worship besides God are fuel for Hell; you will surely enter it. Had these been gods, they would not have entered it, and all will abide therein eternally. Therein they will have sighing, and therein they will not hear."
21:101-103	Indeed, those for whom good has preceded from Us - those will be removed from it. They will not hear its hissing sound, and they will abide eternally in that which their souls desire. The greatest terror will not grieve them, and the angels will meet them, [saying], “This is your Day which you were promised.”
21:104-106	The Day We will roll up the heaven like the rolling up of a scroll for books. As We began the first creation, We will repeat it. [It is] a promise binding upon Us. Indeed, We will do it. And We had already written in the Psalms, after the remembrance, that the earth will be inherited by My righteous servants. Indeed in this is a message for a people who worship.
21:107-112	"We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds. Say, ""It is only revealed to me that your God is one God. So will you submit [to Allah's will]? But if they turn away, say, 'I have warned you of a just cause, and I do not know whether what you are promised is near or far.' Indeed, He knows what is declared of speech and He knows what you conceal. And I do not know that it may be a trial for you and an enjoyment for a time."" He said, ""My Lord, judge with truth, and our Lord is the Most Merciful. Help is sought against that which you describe."""
22:1-2	O mankind, fear your Lord. Indeed, the convulsion of the Hour is a terrible thing. The Day you see it, every nursing mother will forget her suckling mother, and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the people as if they were drunk, but they are not drunk. Rather, the punishment of Allah is severe.
22:3-4	And among the people is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge and follows every rebellious devil. It is decreed for him that whoever takes him as an ally - he will mislead him and guide him to the punishment of the Blaze.
22:5-7	O mankind, if you are in doubt about the Resurrection - then indeed We created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot, then from a lump of flesh, some formed and some unformed, that We may make clear to you. And We settle in the wombs whom We will for a specified term; then We bring you out as a child, then [O Muhammad], that you may reach your full strength. And among you is he who is taken in death, and among you is he who is returned to the most decrepit age so that he does not know, after [having] knowledge, a thing. And you see the earth lifeless, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and swells and grows [abundantly] of every beautiful kind. That is because Allah is the Truth, and that He gives life to the dead, and that He is over all things competent. And because the Hour is coming - there is no doubt about it - and because Allah will resurrect those in the graves.
22:8-13	And among the people is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening Book. He turns away [from Allah's path] to mislead [others] from the way of Allah. For him in this world is disgrace, and We will make him taste the punishment of the Burning Fire on the Day of Resurrection. That is for what your hands have put forth, and because Allah is not unjust to His servants. And among the people is he who worships Allah on the edge. If good befalls him, he is satisfied therewith, but if a trial befalls him, he turns back on his face. He loses this world and the Hereafter. That is what is the manifest loss. He invokes besides Allah that which can neither harm him nor benefit him. That is what is far astray. He invokes one whose harm is nearer than his benefit. What an evil protector and an evil companion!
22:14-15	Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. Indeed, Allah does what He intends. Whoever thinks that Allah will not support him in this world and the Hereafter - let him stretch out a rope to the heaven; then let it be cut off. Then let him see whether his plan will remove that which enrages him.
22:16-18	And thus We have sent it down as clear verses, and indeed, Allah guides whom He wills. Indeed, those who have believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabeans or Magians or polytheists - indeed, Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, Allah is, over all things, Witness. Have you not seen that to Allah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth and the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the trees, the moving creatures and many of the people? And many upon whom the punishment has been justified. And he upon whom Allah humiliates - for him there is none to give him honor. Indeed, Allah does what He wills.
22:19-22	These are two adversaries who have disputed about their Lord. As for those who disbelieve, garments of fire will be cut out for them. Boiling water will be poured down over their heads. It will melt what is within their bellies and their skins. And they will have maces of iron. Whenever they wish to get out of it out of distress, they will be returned to it [and] [returned] [to it] and [they will be] made to taste the punishment of the Burning Fire.
22:23-24	Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. They will be adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments therein will be silk. And they are guided to good speech and guided to the path of the Praiseworthy.
22:25-29	"Indeed, those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of Allah and from al-Masjid al-Haram, which We have made for mankind - whether they stay therein or travel - and whoever intends therein to commit injustice - We will make him taste of a painful punishment. And [mention] when We designated for Abraham the site of the House, [saying], ""Do not associate anything with Me and purify My House for those who perform Tawaf and those who stand [in prayer] and those who bow and prostrate. And proclaim to mankind the Hajj [pilgrimage]; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel, coming from every distant pass - that they may witness benefits for themselves and mention the name of Allah on known days over what He has provided for them of sacrificial animals. So eat from them and feed the poor and needy. Then let them complete their rites and fulfill their vows and perform Tawaf around the Ancient House."""
22:30-37	That is, and whoever honors the sacred ordinances of Allah - it is better for him with his Lord. And grazing livestock have been made lawful to you, except what is recited to you. So avoid the uncleanness of idols and avoid false statement - being upright for Allah, not associating others with Him. And whoever associates others with Allah - it is as if he had fallen from the sky and been snatched by birds or the wind had blown him to a remote place. That is, and whoever honors the symbols of Allah - indeed, it is from the piety of hearts. For you therein are benefits for a specified term, then their place of residence is at the Ancient House. And for every nation We have appointed rites that they may mention the name of Allah over what He has provided for them of livestock. But your God is one God, so to Him they submit. And give good tidings to the humbly submissive - those who, when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and are patient over what befalls them and establish prayer and spend out of what We have provided for them. And the sacrificial animals - We have made them for you among the symbols of Allah - for you therein is good, so mention the name of Allah over them while standing in line. And when their sides are down, eat from them and feed the contented and the needy. Thus have We subjected them to you that you may be grateful. Allah does not need their meat or their blood, but He needs your piety. Thus has He subjected them to you that you may glorify Allah for having guided you. And give good tidings to the doers of good.
22:38-41	"Indeed, Allah defends those who have believed. Indeed, Allah does not like any treacherous ingrate. Permission is given to those against whom war is made, because they have been wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory. [They are] those who have been expelled from their homes without right - only because they say, ""Our Lord is Allah."" And were it not that Allah checks some people by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques in which the name of Allah is much mentioned would surely have been pulled down. And Allah will surely support those who support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might. [They are] those who, if We establish them in the land, establish prayer and give zakah and enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong. And to Allah belongs the outcome of events."
22:42-46	And if they deny you, [O Muhammad], - so were denied before them the people of Noah, 'Aad, and Thamud, and the people of Abraham, and the people of Lot, and the companions of Midian. And Moses denied, so I granted respite to the disbelievers; then I seized them - and how terrible was My punishment! How many a city have We destroyed while it was doing wrong? So it lies desolate upon its roofs, and a well unused, and a lofty palace. Have they not traveled through the land and had hearts by which to reason, and ears by which to hear? For indeed, it is not eyes that are blinded, but blinded are the hearts which are within the breasts.
22:47-48	And they urge you to hasten the punishment, but Allah will not fail in His promise. Indeed, a day with your Lord is like a thousand years of those which you count. And how many a town was granted respite while it was wrongdoing? Then I seized it, and to Me is the final destination.
22:49-51	"Say, ""O mankind, I am only to you a clear warner. So those who believe and do righteous deeds - for them is forgiveness and noble provision. But those who strive against Our verses to frustrate them - those are the companions of Hellfire."""
22:52-57	And We did not send before you any messenger or prophet except that when he spoke, Satan cast into his speech. But Allah nullifies what Satan casts, and then Allah establishes His verses. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. That He may make what Satan casts a trial for those in whose hearts is disease and whose hearts are hardened. And indeed, the wrongdoers are in extreme dissension. And that those who have been given knowledge may know that it is the truth from your Lord, and believe in it, so their hearts may submit to it. And indeed, Allah is the guide of those who believe to a straight path. And those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt thereof until the Hour comes upon them suddenly, or there comes to them the punishment of a barren Day. The dominion that Day will belong to Allah, to judge between them. So those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Delight. But those who disbelieve and deny Our verses - those will have a humiliating punishment.
22:58-66	And those who have emigrated for the cause of Allah and then were killed or died - Allah will surely provide for them a good provision. And indeed, Allah is the best of providers. He will surely admit them to an entrance with which they will be pleased. And indeed, Allah is Knowing and Forbearing. And whoever punishes with the equivalent of that with which he was afflicted and then is wronged - Allah will surely aid him. Indeed, Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving. That is because Allah merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night. And indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing. That is because Allah is the Truth and that which they invoke besides Him is falsehood. And indeed, Allah is the Most High, the Grand. Have you not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky, and the earth becomes green? Indeed, Allah is Kind and Acquainted. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. And indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy. Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is on the earth and the ships sail through the sea by His command and He holds back the sky from falling upon the earth except by His permission? Indeed, Allah is to the people Kind and Merciful. And it is He who gives you life; then He will cause you to die, then He will bring you back to life. Indeed, mankind is ungrateful.
22:67-72	"For every nation We have appointed rites which they must follow. So let them not dispute with you over the matter, and invite [people] to your Lord. Indeed, you are upon a straight guidance. And if they argue with you, say, ""Allah is most knowing of what you do."" Allah will judge between you on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which you used to differ. Do you not know that Allah knows whatever is in the heaven and the earth? Indeed, that is in a Record. Indeed, that, for Allah, is easy. And they worship besides Allah that for which He has not sent down authority and that of which they have no knowledge. And there is not for the wrongdoers any helper. And when Our verses are recited to them as clear proofs, you recognize in the faces of those who disbelieve disapproval. They almost assault those who recite to them Our verses. Say, ""Shall I inform you of one worse than that? The Fire has promised it to those who disbelieve, and wretched is the destination."""
22:73-76	O mankind, an example is made, so listen to it. Indeed, those you invoke besides Allah cannot create a fly, even if they banded together for that purpose. And if the fly steals away something from them, they could not recover it from it. Weak are the pursuer and the pursued. They do not esteem Allah with His true esteem. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might. Allah chooses from among the angels messengers and from among the people. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing. He knows what is before them and what is behind them. And to Allah are all matters returned.
22:77-78	O you who have believed, bow and prostrate and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful. And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him. He has chosen you and has not placed upon you in the religion any difficulty - the religion of your father Abraham. He named you Muslims before and in this [religion] that the Messenger may be a witness over you and you may be witnesses over the people. So establish prayer and give zakah and hold fast to Allah. He is your Protector, and excellent is the Protector, and excellent is the Helper.
23:1-11	Indeed, the believers have succeeded. They are those who are humble in their prayers. And they who turn away from ill speech. And they who are obligatory upon the poor-due. And they who guard their private parts. Except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors. And they are to their trusts and their covenants attentive. And they are constant in their prayers. Those are the inheritors. They will inherit Paradise, wherein they will abide eternally.
23:12-16	And We have certainly created man from an extract of clay. Then We placed him as a sperm-drop in a firm lodging. Then We made the sperm-drop into a clinging clot, then We made the clot into a lump of flesh, then We made the lump of flesh bones, then We covered the bones with flesh, then We developed him into another creation. So blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators. Then indeed, after that, you will die. Then indeed, on the Day of Resurrection, you will be resurrected.
23:17-22	And We have certainly created above you seven paths, and We are not unaware of creation. And We sent down from the sky water in due measure, and We settled it in the earth, and indeed, We are Able to take it away. And We produced for you thereby gardens of palm trees and grapevines, in which you have much fruit, and from which you eat. And a tree emerges from Mount Sinai, which produces oil and a condiment for those who eat. And indeed, in the grazing livestock is a lesson for you. We give you drink from what is in their bellies, and for you in them are many benefits, and from them you eat. And upon them and upon the ships you are carried.
23:23-30	"And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he said, ""O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. Will you not then fear Allah?"" But the eminent ones who disbelieved among his people said, ""This is not but a man like you who desires to excel you. And if Allah had willed, He could have sent down angels. We have not heard of this among our forefathers of old."" He is only a man possessed by madness, so wait for him for a time. He said, ""My Lord, support me because they deny."" So We inspired him, ""Construct the ark under Our observation and according to Our inspiration. Then when Our command comes and the oven overflows, take into it two mates of every kind and your family, except those against whom the word has already preceded among them. And address Me not concerning those who have wronged; indeed, they are to be drowned."" And when you and those with you have settled in the ark, say, ""Praise be to Allah, who has saved us from the wrongdoing people."" And say, ""My Lord, alight me at a blessed landing place, for You are the best to alight."" Indeed in that are signs, and we were to be tested."
23:31-41	"Then We produced after them another generation. And We sent among them a messenger from themselves, [saying], ""Worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him. So will you not fear Allah?"" And the eminent among his people who disbelieved and denied the meeting of the Hereafter - and whom We had given luxuries in the life of this world - said, ""This is not but a human being like you; he eats of what you eat and drinks of what you drink. And if you obey a human being like yourselves, indeed, you would be losers."" Does he promise you that when you die and become dust and bones, you will be brought forth? Far, far is that which you are promised. There is not but our worldly life. We die and live, and we will not be resurrected. He is not but a man who has invents a lie against Allah, and we are not believers in him. He said, ""My Lord, support me because they deny."" He said, ""In a little while they will surely become regretful."" So the blast seized them in truth, and We made them scum. So away with the wrongdoing people."
23:42-44	Then We produced after them other generations. No nation can precede its term, nor can they delay it. Then We sent Our messengers in succession. Every time a messenger came to a nation, they denied him. So We made some of them follow others and made them [others] stories. So away with a people who do not believe.
23:45-50	"Then We sent Moses and his brother Aaron with Our signs and a clear authority to Pharaoh and his chiefs, but they were arrogant and were a haughty people. They said, ""Shall we believe in two human beings like ourselves while their people worship us?"" But they denied them and were among those destroyed. And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture that they might be guided. And We made the son of Mary and his mother a sign and sheltered them on a high ground having stability and springs."
23:51-61	O messengers, eat from the good foods and work righteousness. Indeed, I, of what you do, am Knowing. And indeed, this, your community, is one community, and I am your Lord, so fear Me. But they divided their affair among themselves into sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has. So leave them in their confusion for a time. Do they think that what We provide them of wealth and children will hasten to them with good things? Rather, they do not perceive. Indeed, those who are fearful of their Lord. And those who believe in the signs of their Lord. And those who do not associate anything with their Lord. And those who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their Lord. Those are the ones who hasten to good deeds and are the forerunners in them.
23:62-77	"And We charge no soul except [with that within] its capacity, and with Us is a record that speaks the truth, and they will not be wronged. Rather, their hearts are in overflowing with this, and they have other deeds besides that, for which they are doing. Until, when We seize their affluent ones with punishment, at once they cry out, ""Do not cry out today; indeed, you will not be aided by Us."" My verses were recited to you, but you were turning back on your heels, arrogant about it, spending idle time there. Have they not pondered the Word? Or has there come to them that which did not come to their forefathers of old? Or do they not recognize their Messenger, so they deny it? Or do they say, ""It is madness?"" Rather, he has brought them the truth, while most of them, to the truth, are averse. And if the truth had followed their desires, the heavens and the earth and whoever is in them would have been ruined. Rather, We have brought them their message, but from their message they turn away. Or do you ask them for an exit? But the exit of your Lord is better, and He is the Best of providers. And indeed, you are inviting them to a straight path. And indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are deviating from the path. And if We had mercy on them and removed the harm that is upon them, they would persist in their transgression, wandering blindly. And We seized them with punishment, but they did not humble themselves before their Lord, nor did they supplicate. Until, when We opened to them a door of severe punishment, at once they were therein in despair."
23:78-92	"It is He who created for you hearing and sight and hearts - little do you give thanks. And it is He who dispersed you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered. And it is He who gives life and causes death, and to Him belongs the alternation of the night and the day. Then will you not reason? They say like what the former peoples said. They say, ""When we have died and become dust and bones, will we then be resurrected?"" We and our fathers were promised this before. This is nothing but legends of the former peoples. Say, ""To whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it, if you should know?"" They will say, ""To God."" Say, ""Then will you not remember?"" Say, ""Who is the Lord of the seven heavens and Lord of the Mighty Throne?"" They will say, ""To God."" Say, ""Then will you not fear God?"" Say, ""In whose hand is the dominion over all things? He protects, while none can protect Him, if you should know?"" They will say, ""To God."" Say, ""Then how are you bewitched?"" Rather, We have brought them the truth, and indeed, they are liars. God has not taken a son, nor was there any god with Him. If so, each god would have taken away what he created, and some of them would have attempted to overcome others. Glory be to God, above what they describe. Knower of the unseen and the witnessed; so exalted is He above what they associate with Him."
23:93-98	"Say, ""My Lord, if only You would show me what they are promised. My Lord, do not place me among the wrongdoing people. And indeed, We are able to show you what We promise them. Repel evil with that which is best. Indeed, We are most knowing of what they describe."" And say, ""My Lord, I seek refuge in You from the insinuations of the devils. And I seek refuge in You, my Lord, lest they be present."""
23:99-114	"Until, when death comes to one of them, he says, ""My Lord, send me back [to the world] that I may do righteousness in that which I left behind."" No! It is only a word he will say. And behind them is a barrier until the Day they are resurrected. And when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship between them that Day, nor will they ask about one another. So those whose scales are heavy - those will be the successful. And those whose scales are light - those are the ones who have lost themselves in Hell, abiding eternally. The Fire will burn their faces, and they will be therein disgraced. Were not My verses recited to you, and you used to deny them? They will say, ""Our Lord, our wretchedness overcame us, and we were a people astray. Our Lord, bring us out of it, and if we return, then we will be wrongdoers."" He will say, ""Remain despised therein and do not speak to me."" Indeed, there was a party of My servants who said, ""Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and You are the Best of the merciful."" But you took them in ridicule until they made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them. Indeed, I have rewarded them this Day for what they patiently endured - they are the successful. He will say, ""How many years did you remain on the earth?"" They will say, ""We remained a day or part of a day, so ask the counters."" He said, ""You have only remained a little while, if you only knew."""
23:115-118	"Did you think that We created you in vain and that to Us you will not be returned? So exalted is Allah, the True King. There is no deity except Him, Lord of the Noble Throne. And whoever invokes along with Allah another deity for which he has no proof - then his account is only with his Lord. Indeed, the disbelievers will not succeed. And say, ""My Lord, forgive and have mercy, and You are the best of the merciful."""
24:1-3	A surah which We have revealed and imposed, and We have revealed therein clear verses that you may remember. The adulterer and the adulteress - flog each of them with a hundred stripes. And let not pity for them detain you in the matter of the religion of Allah, if you should believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of the believers witness their punishment. The adulterer does not marry except an adulteress or a polytheist, and the adulteress - none marries her except an adulterer or a polytheist. And that is forbidden to the believers.
24:4-5	And those who accuse chaste women but do not produce four witnesses - lash them with eighty lashes and do not accept their testimony ever after, and those are the wicked. Except for those who repent after that and reform, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
24:6-10	And those who accuse their wives but have no witnesses except themselves - the testimony of one of them shall be four testimonies by Allah that he is among the truthful. And the fifth [should be] that the curse of Allah be upon him, if he should be among the liars. And the fifth [should be] that the wrath of Allah be upon her, if he should be among the truthful. And had it not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, and that Allah is Forgiving and Wise.
24:11-18	Indeed, those who brought forth the slander are a group among you. Do not think it is evil for you; rather, it is good for you. For every person among them is what he has earned of sin. And he who took upon himself the greater part of it among them will have a great punishment. Why did not, when you heard it, the believing men and believing women think good of themselves and say, “This is an obvious slander?” Why did they not produce four witnesses for it? But since they do not produce witnesses, then it is those in the sight of Allah who are the liars. And had it not been for the favor of Allah upon you and His mercy in this world and the Hereafter, a great punishment would have touched you for what you have uttered. When you received it with your tongues and said with your mouths that of which you had no knowledge and thought it was insignificant while it was in the sight of Allah grave. And why did not, when you heard it, you say, “It is not for us to speak of this. Glory be to You! This is a tremendous slander.” Allah admonishes you not to return to the like of it ever, if you are believers. And Allah makes clear to you the verses, and Allah is Knowing and Wise.
24:19-20	Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread among those who have believed will have a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And God knows, while you do not know. And had it not been for the grace of God upon you and His mercy and that God is Kind and Merciful.
24:21-22	O you who have believed, do not follow the footsteps of Satan. And whoever follows the footsteps of Satan - he indeed commands immorality and wrongdoing. And were it not for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy, not one of you would ever have been pure. But Allah purifies whom He wills. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. And let not those among you who are endowed with grace and wealth swear not to give to their relatives and the needy and the emigrants in the cause of Allah. And let them pardon and overlook. Would you not like that Allah should forgive you? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
24:23-26	Indeed, those who accuse chaste, unaware, believing women are cursed in this world and the Hereafter, and they will have a great punishment. The Day their tongues, their hands, and their feet will bear witness against them as to what they used to do. That Day Allah will pay them in full their due compensation, and they will know that Allah is the Truth, the Evident. Evil women are for evil men, and evil men are for evil women; and good men are for good men, and good men are for good women. Those are clear of what they say. For them is forgiveness and noble provision.
24:27-29	"O you who have believed, do not enter houses other than your own houses until you have asked permission and greeted their inhabitants. That is better for you that you may be reminded. But if you find no one therein, do not enter it until permission is given to you. And if it is said to you, ""Go back,"" then go back; it is purer for you. And Allah is Knowing of what you do. There is no blame upon you for entering houses not inhabited in which there is provision for you. And Allah knows what you reveal and what you conceal."
24:30-31	Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their private parts. That is purer for them. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their private parts and not to display their adornment except that which appears thereof and to draw their headcovers over their bosoms and not to display their adornment except to their husbands, their fathers, their husbands' fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers, their brothers' sons, their sisters' sons, their women, or those their right hands possess, or male attendants who have no desire, or children who have not yet attained knowledge of the private parts of women. And let them not stamp their feet so that what they hide of their adornment may be known. And repent to Allah all together, O believers, that you may succeed.
24:32-34	And marry those among you who are single and those among your male slaves and female slaves who are righteous. If they are poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty. And Allah is All-Encompassing and Knowing. And let those who find not the wherewithal for marriage keep themselves chaste until Allah enriches them from His bounty. And those who seek a contract from those whom your right hands possess, then contract them a contract if you know good in them and give them from the wealth of Allah which He has given you. And do not compel your slave girls to prostitution if they desire chastity, seeking the goods of worldly life. And whoever compels them - then indeed, after their compulsion, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And We have certainly sent down to you clear verses and an example from those who passed on before you and an instruction for the righteous.
24:35-38	Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth. The example of His light is as a niche within which is a lamp, the lamp is within glass, the glass as if it were a pearly star lit from a blessed olive tree, neither of the east nor of the west, whose oil would almost glow even if untouched by fire. Light upon light. Allah guides to His light whom He wills. And Allah presents examples for the people, and Allah is Knowing of all things. [They are] in houses which Allah has permitted to be raised and that His name be mentioned therein. He is glorified therein in the mornings and the evenings. [They are] men whom neither commerce nor sale distracts from the remembrance of Allah and performance of prayer and giving of zakah. They fear a Day in which the hearts and eyes will turn about - that Allah may reward them for the best of what they did and increase them from His bounty. And Allah provides for whom He wills without account.
24:39-40	And those who disbelieve - their deeds are like a mirage in a lowland which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds Allah with him and He will pay him his due. And Allah is swift in account. Or [they are] [like] darknesses within a deep sea which is covered by waves, upon which are waves, upon which are clouds - darknesses, one upon another. If he puts out his hand, he can scarcely see it. And he for whom Allah does not appoint light - for him there is no light.
24:41-45	Have you not seen that to Allah all who are in the heavens and the earth and the birds with outspread wings exalt Him? Each has known its prayer and its glorification. And Allah is Knowing of what they do. And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah is the final destination. Have you not seen that Allah drives the clouds? Then He brings them together, then He makes them into a mass, and you see the rain emerge from within it. And He sends down from the sky, [many] mountains within which is hail. He strikes with it whom He wills and averts it from whom He wills. The flash of its lightning almost takes away the sight. Allah alternates the night and the day. Indeed in that is a lesson for those of vision. And Allah has created every living creature from water. And of them are some that crawl on their bellies, and some that walk on two legs, and some that walk on four. Allah creates what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent.
24:46-54	"We have sent down clear verses, and Allah guides whom He wills to a straight path. And they say, ""We have believed in Allah and the Messenger, and we obey."" But then a party of them turns away after that. And those are not believers. And when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, at once a party of them turn away. But if the truth is with them, they come to him in submission. Is there a disease in their hearts, or do they doubt, or do they fear that Allah and His Messenger will deal unjustly with them? Rather, it is those who are the wrongdoers. The only statement of the believers, when they are called to Allah and His Messenger to judge between them, is to say, ""We hear and we obey."" And it is those who will be the successful. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger and fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him - it is those who are the successful. And they swear by Allah their most solemn oaths, ""If you command them, they will surely go forth."" Say, ""Do not swear [your oaths] in a known manner of obedience."" Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do. Say, ""Obey Allah and obey the Messenger."" But if they turn away, then upon him is only that which he is charged with, and upon you is that which you are charged with. And if you obey him, you will be guided. And upon the Messenger is only the clear notification."
24:55-57	Allah has promised those who believe among you and do righteous deeds that He will surely make them successors [to Him] upon the earth, just as He made those before them successors, and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He has approved for them, and that He will surely substitute for them, after their fear, security, [for] they worship Me, not associating anything with Me. But whoever disbelieves after that - then those are the wicked. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey the Messenger that you may receive mercy. Do not think that those who disbelieve can escape [Allah's] punishment upon the earth. Their refuge is the Fire, and wretched indeed is the destination.
24:58-61	O you who have believed, let those whom your right hands possess and those among you who have not yet reached puberty ask permission of you three times: before the dawn prayer and when you put off your clothing at noon and after the 'Isha prayer. These are three private places for you. There is no blame upon you or upon them after them, going about among you, one by one. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses, and Allah is Knowing and Wise. And when the children among you have attained puberty, let them ask permission as those before them have asked permission. Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses, and Allah is Knowing and Wise. And as for women past childbearing age who no longer expect marriage, there is no blame upon them for putting aside their outer garments [otherwise] not displaying their adornment. But to abstain is better for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. There is no blame upon the blind or upon the lame or upon the ill or upon yourselves - that you eat from your houses or the houses of your fathers or the houses of your mothers or the houses of your brothers or the houses of your sisters or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your aunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts or the houses of your friend. There is no blame upon you if you eat together or separately. So when you enter houses, greet one another with a greeting from God, blessed and good. Thus does God make clear to you the verses that you may understand.
24:62-64	The believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger, and when they are with him on a common matter, they do not depart until they have asked his permission. Those who ask your permission are those who believe in Allah and His Messenger. So when they ask your permission for some of their affairs, give permission to whom you will of them and ask forgiveness for them from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Do not make the calling of the Messenger among you like the calling of one of you to another. Allah may know those of you who slip away secretly. So let those beware who oppose his command, lest some trial befall them or a painful punishment be inflicted upon them. Unquestionably, to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. He certainly knows that which you are doing. And on the Day they will be returned to Him, He will inform them of what they did. And Allah is Knowing of all things.
25:1-2	Blessed is He who sent down the Criterion upon His Servant that he may be to the worlds a warner. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and has not taken a son and has not had a partner in dominion. He created all things and determined them with [precise] determination.
25:3-6	"And they have taken besides Him gods who create nothing and are themselves created and possess no power to harm or benefit themselves, nor possess death or life or resurrection. And those who disbelieve say, ""This is not but a falsehood he has invented, and another people have aided him in it."" But they have brought about injustice and falsehood. And they say, ""Legends of the former peoples which he has written down, and they are dictated to him morning and evening."" Say, ""He has sent it down who knows the secret in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is Forgiving and Merciful."""
25:7-10	And they said, “What is this Messenger who eats food and walks in the markets? Why has not an angel been sent down to him to be with him as a warner? Or a treasure thrown down to him, or he have a garden from which he eats?” And the wrongdoers said, “You follow none but a man bewitched.” See how they set forth for you examples, but they have gone astray and cannot find a way. Blessed is He who, if He wills, can grant you better than that - gardens beneath which rivers flow - and He can grant you palaces.
25:11-16	Rather, they denied the Hour, and We have prepared for those who deny the Hour a Blaze. When they see them from a distant place, they will hear its wrath and its roaring. And when they are thrown therein into a narrow place, chained together, they will cry out therein for destruction. Do not cry out today for a single destruction, but cry out for much destruction. Say, “Is that better or the Garden of Eternity which the righteous have been promised?” It will be for them a reward and a destination. They will have therein whatever they wish, abiding eternally. It is upon your Lord a promise which will be asked of.”
25:17-20	"And the Day He will gather them and those they worshipped besides Allah and He will say, ""Was it you who led these My servants astray, or were they themselves who went astray from the way?"" They will say, ""Glory be to You! It was not for us to take protectors besides You. But You provided for them and their fathers until they forgot the message and were a people who were ruined. They have denied you in what you say, but you are not able to avert [your enemies] or to help. And whoever among you does wrong - We will make him taste a great punishment. And We did not send before you any messengers except that they ate food and walked in the markets. And We have made some of you a trial for others - will you have patience?"" And ever is your Lord Seeing."
25:21-29	"And those who do not expect the meeting with Us will say, ""Why were angels not sent down to us or why do we not see our Lord?"" They have certainly been arrogant within themselves and have transgressed with great transgression. The Day they see the angels - no good news will be given that Day for the criminals, and they will say, ""A forbidden, forbidden thing."" And We will present to them whatever deeds they did and make it as scattered dust. The companions of Paradise, that Day, will be the best settlement and the best place to rest. And the Day the heaven will be split open with clouds and the angels will be sent down in successive revelation. The sovereignty that Day will belong to the Most Merciful, and it will be a difficult Day for the disbelievers. And the Day the wrongdoer will bite his hands and say, ""Oh, would that I had taken with the Messenger a way! Oh, woe to me! Would that I had not taken so-and-so as a friend!"" He led me astray from the message after it had come to me. And ever is Satan, to man, a deserter."
25:30-34	"And the Messenger said, ""O my Lord, indeed my people have taken this Qur'an to be something abandoned."" And thus We have made for every prophet an enemy from among the criminals. And sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and a Helper. And those who disbelieve say, ""Why was the Qur'an not revealed to him all at once?"" Thus [it is] that We may strengthen thereby your heart. And We have spaced it distinctly. And they do not bring you an example except that We bring you the truth and the best explanation. Those who will be gathered on their faces into Hell - those are worse in position and further astray in way."
25:35-40	"And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture and appointed with him his brother Aaron as a minister. Then We said, ""Go both of you to the people who denied Our revelations,"" and We destroyed them with [complete] destruction. And the people of Noah, when they denied the messengers, We drowned them and made them a sign for the people. And We have prepared for the wrongdoers a painful punishment. And [so did] 'Aad and Thamud and the companions of Ar-Rass and many generations between them. And for each We presented examples, and each We destroyed with [complete] destruction. And they had certainly come upon the city on which was rained an evil rain. Did they not see it? Rather, they were not expecting resurrection."
25:41-44	And when they see you, they take you only in ridicule. “Is this he whom Allah has sent as a messenger?” He almost led us astray from our gods had we not been patient toward them. And they will know when they see the punishment who is most astray in way. Have you seen he who has taken as his god his [own] desire? Then would you be responsible for him? Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? They are not except like livestock. Rather, they are even more astray in way.
25:45-55	Have you not seen how your Lord extended the shadow? If He had willed, He could have made it stationary. Then We made the sun its guide. Then We seized it with a gentle seizure. And it is He who made for you the night as a covering and sleep as rest and made the day for resurrection. And it is He who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy and sends down from the sky pure water that We may revive thereby a dead land and give drink thereof to many of what We have created - livestock and people. And We have certainly distributed it among them that they may be reminded, but most of the people refuse except disbelief. And if We willed, We could have sent to every city a warner. So do not obey the disbelievers and strive against them with it with a great striving. And it is He who has released the two seas - one fresh and sweet and the other salty and bitter - and placed between them a barrier and an insurmountable partition. And it is He who created from water human beings and made them [relatives] by blood and marriage. And ever is your Lord competent. And they worship besides Allah that which neither benefits them nor harms them. And ever is the disbeliever, against his Lord, a supporter.
25:56-62	"We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. Say, ""I do not ask of you for this any payment, except that whoever wills should take to his Lord a way. And put your trust in the Ever-Living who does not die, and exalt [Allah] with praise. And sufficient is He, concerning the sins of His servants, as Acquainted. He who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, then established Himself on the Throne - the Most Gracious. So ask about Him one who is acquainted. And when it is said to them, ""Prostrate to the Most Gracious,"" they say, ""And what is the Most Gracious? Should we prostrate to that which you command us?"" And it increases them in aversion. Blessed is He who has placed within the heaven constellations and placed therein a lamp and a moon giving light. And it is He who has made the night and the day in succession for whoever desires to remember or desires to be grateful."
25:63-77	"The servants of the Most Merciful are those who walk upon the earth easily, and when the ignorant address them, they say, ""Peace."" And those who spend the night prostrating and standing before their Lord. And those who say, ""Our Lord, avert from us the punishment of Hell. Indeed, its punishment is ever perpetual."" Indeed, it is an evil settlement and a residence. And those who, when they spend, are neither extravagant nor niggardly, but are ever, between that, a medium [way]. And those who do not invoke with Allah another deity or kill the soul which Allah has forbidden, except by right, and do not commit unlawful sexual intercourse. And whoever should do that will meet a penalty. The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will abide therein in humiliation. Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful. And whoever repents and does righteousness - indeed, he turns to Allah with [former] repentance. And those who do not bear false witness, and when they pass by ill speech, they pass by with dignity. And those who, when they are reminded of the verses of their Lord, do not fall upon them deaf and blind. And those who say, ""Our Lord, grant us from among our wives and offspring comfort to our eyes and make us an example for the righteous."" Those will be rewarded with the highest chamber for what they patiently endured, and they will be met therein with greetings and peace. They will abide therein eternally. Excellent is the settlement and the residence. Say, ""My Lord would not care for you were it not for your supplication. But you have denied, so it is bound to be."""
26:1-9	Ta, Mim. These are the verses of the clear Book. Perhaps you would kill yourself with grief that they do not believe. If We will, We could send down to them a sign from the heaven, to which their necks would remain humbled. And there does not come to them a reminder from the Most Merciful except that they turn away from it. So they have denied. So there will come to them news of that which they used to ridicule. Have they not seen the earth - how much We have produced therein of every noble kind? Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord - it is He who is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
26:10-22	"And remember when your Lord called to Moses, ""Go to the wrongdoing people - the people of Pharaoh - will they not fear God?"" He said, ""My Lord, indeed I fear that they will deny me, and my chest will become constricted, and my tongue will not be fluent, so send to Aaron. And they have a sin against me, so I fear that they will kill me."" He said, ""No! Go with Our signs. Indeed, we are with you, listening."" So go to Pharaoh and say, ""Indeed, we are messengers from the Lord of the worlds. Send with us the Children of Israel."" He said, ""Did we not raise you among us as a child, and you remained among us for years of your life? And did you not do the deed that you did, while you were of the disbelievers?"" He said, ""I did it then, while I was of those astray. So I fled from you when I feared you. So my Lord bestowed upon me wisdom and made me one of the messengers."" And that is a favor You bestowed upon me, that I enslaved the Children of Israel."
26:23-40	"Pharaoh said, ""And what is the Lord of the worlds?"" He said, ""The Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, if you should be certain."" He said to those around him, ""Do you not listen?"" He said, ""Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of old."" He said, ""Indeed, your messenger who has been sent to you is mad."" He said, ""The Lord of the east and the west and whatever is between them, if you will but use reason."" He said, ""If you should take a god other than me, I will surely make you among the imprisoned."" He said, ""Even if I bring you something clear?"" He said, ""Then bring it, if you should be of the truthful."" So he threw down his staff, and behold, it was a serpent evident. And he withdrew his hand, and behold, it was white to the onlookers. He said to the chiefs around him, ""Indeed, this is a proficient magician. He wants to expel you from your land by his magic. So what do you command?"" They said, ""Put him and his brother off, and send among the cities gatherers who will bring to you every proficient magician."" So the magicians were gathered together for an appointed time on a known day. And it was said to the people, ""Are you going to gather? Perhaps we will follow the magicians, if they are the ones who will prevail."""
26:41-51	"So when the magicians came, they said to Pharaoh, ""Should we have a reward if we are the victors?"" He said, ""Yes, and in that case you will be among those brought near."" Moses said to them, ""Cast down what you are casting down."" So they threw down their ropes and their staffs and said, ""By the might of Pharaoh, indeed we are the victors."" Then Moses threw down his staff, and behold, it devoured what they were fabricating. So the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, ""We have believed in the Lord of the worlds, the Lord of Moses and Aaron."" He said, ""You believed in him before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your chief who has taught you magic. So you will surely know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you all."" They said, ""No harm! Indeed, to our Lord we will return."" Indeed, we hope that our Lord will forgive us our sins, if we were the first of the believers."
26:52-68	"And We inspired Moses, ""Travel by night with My servants. Indeed, you will be pursued."" But Pharaoh sent gatherers into the cities. ""Indeed, these are a small band. And indeed, they are enraging to Us. And indeed, We are all on guard."" So We brought them out of gardens and springs, And treasures and a noble station. Thus We caused them to inherit it from the Children of Israel. So they pursued them at sunrise. And when the two hosts saw each other, the companions of Moses said, ""Indeed, we will be overtaken."" He said, ""By no means! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me."" Then We inspired Moses, ""Strike the sea with your staff."" And it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain. And We brought near the others. And We saved Moses and those with him, all together. Then We drowned the others. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to believe. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful."
26:69-89	"And recite to them the news of Abraham, when he said to his father and his people, ""What do you worship?"" They said, ""We worship idols and remain devoted to them."" He said, ""Do they hear you when you call upon them? Or do they benefit you or harm you?"" They said, ""Rather, we found our fathers doing thus."" He said, ""Have you considered what you used to worship - you and your fathers of old - for indeed, they are an enemy to me, except for the Lord of the worlds. He who created me and it is He who guides me. And it is He who feeds me and gives me drink. And when I am ill, it is He who cures me. And He who will cause me to die and then bring me to life. And He who, I hope, will forgive me my sin on the Day of Judgment. My Lord, grant me wisdom and join me with the righteous. And grant me a reputation of truth among later generations. And make me one of the inheritors of the Garden of Pleasure. And forgive my father, for he was of the astray. And do not disgrace me on the Day they are resurrected - the Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children, except for one who comes to Allah with a sound heart."""
26:90-104	"Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, and Hellfire will be brought into view for the deviators. And it will be said to them, ""Where are those you used to worship? Other than Allah, can they help you or are they victorious?"" So they were thrown down therein, they and the deviators, and the soldiers of Satan, all together. They will say, while they are disputing therein, ""By Allah, we were indeed in manifest error when we made you equal to the Lord of the worlds. And none led us astray except the criminals. So for us there are no intercessors, nor a close friend. If only we had another chance, we could be among the believers. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful."""
26:105-122	"The people of Noah denied the messengers. When their brother Noah said to them, ""Will you not fear God? Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. So fear God and obey me. And I do not ask of you for this any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds. So fear God and obey me."" They said, ""Shall we believe you while the lowest have followed you?"" He said, ""And I have no knowledge of what they used to do. Their account is only with my Lord, if you but perceived. And I will not drive away the believers. I am only a clear warner."" They said, ""If you do not desist, O Noah, you will surely be among the stoned."" He said, ""My Lord, indeed my people have denied. So judge between me and them with a judgment and save me and those with me of the believers."" So We saved him and those with him in the laden ship. Then We drowned the rest after him. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful."
26:123-140	The Aad people denied the messengers. When their brother Hud said to them, “Will you not fear God? Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. So fear God and obey me. And I do not ask of you for this any payment. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.” Do you build on every high place a sign, amusing yourselves? And build for yourselves castles that you may live forever? And when you strike, you strike like tyrants. So fear God and obey me. And fear Him who provided you with what you know. He provided you with livestock and children and gardens and springs. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day. They said, “It is all the same to us whether you preach or are not among the preachers. This is not but the manner of the former peoples, and we will not be punished.” But they denied him, so We destroyed them. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful.
26:141-159	"Thamud denied the messengers, when their brother Salih said to them, ""Will you not fear God? Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. So fear God and obey me. And I do not ask of you any reward for it. My reward is only from the Lord of the worlds. Will you be left here secure? Among gardens and springs and crops and palm trees with soft fruit, and you carve out of the mountains, houses in splendor? So fear God and obey me. And do not obey the command of the transgressors - Those who cause corruption in the land and do not reform. They said, ""You are only of those bewitched. You are not but a human being like us. So bring me a sign, if you should be of the truthful."" He said, ""This is a she-camel; she has her drink, and you have her drink on a known day. And do not touch her with harm, lest the punishment of a terrible Day seize you."" So they hamstrung her, and in the morning they became regretful. So the punishment seized them. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful."
26:160-175	"The people of Lot denied the messengers. When their brother Lot said to them, ""Will you not fear God? Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. So fear God and obey me. And I do not ask of you any payment for it. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds. Do you approach males among the worlds and abandon what your Lord has created for you as mates? Rather, you are a transgressing people."" They said, ""If you do not desist, O Lot, you will surely be among those expelled."" He said, ""Indeed, I am of your work among those who detest it. My Lord, save me and my family from what they do."" So We saved him and his family, all together, except an old woman among those who remained behind. Then We destroyed the others. And We rained upon them a rain - so evil was the rain of those who were warned. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord - He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful."
26:176-191	"The companions of the thicket denied the messengers. When Shu'aib said to them, ""Will you not fear God? Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. So fear God and obey me. And I do not ask of you any payment for it. My payment is only from the Lord of the worlds. Give full measure and do not be among the losers. And weigh with a straight balance. And do not deprive people of their due rights and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption. And fear Him who created you and the former generations."" They said, ""You are only of those charmed. You are not but a human being like us, and we think you are among the liars. So let fall upon us a fragment from the sky, if you should be of the truthful."" He said, ""My Lord is most knowing of what you do."" But they denied him, so the punishment of the Day of Shadow seized them. Indeed, it was the punishment of a tremendous Day. Indeed in that is a sign, but most of them were not to be believers. And indeed, your Lord - it is He who is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful."
26:192-212	And indeed, it is a revelation from the Lord of the worlds. The Trustworthy Spirit has brought it down upon your heart, that you may be among the warners. In a clear Arabic tongue. And indeed, it is in the scriptures of former times. Was it not a sign to them that the scholars of the Children of Israel knew it? And if We had sent it down to some non-Arab and he had recited it to them, they would not have believed in it. Thus We have caused it to enter the hearts of the criminals. They will not believe in it until they see the painful punishment. So it will come upon them suddenly while they perceive not. And they will say, “Are we then reprieved?” Is it then that they seek to hasten Our punishment? Have you seen if We should give them enjoyment for years? Then there comes to them that which they were promised. What they were enjoying would not avail them. And We did not destroy a city except that it had warners. A reminder, and We were not wrongdoers. And the devils did not bring it down. Nor is it befitting for them, nor are they able to. Indeed, they are removed from hearing.
26:213-227	"So do not invoke with Allah another deity, lest you be among the punished. And warn your nearest relatives. And lower your wing to those who follow you of the believers. But if they disobey you, then say, ""Indeed, I am innocent of what you do."" And rely upon the Exalted in Might, the Merciful. Who sees you when you stand up and your movement among those who prostrate. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing. Shall I inform you upon whom the devils descend? They descend upon every slanderer and sinner. They listen only to a deviant, but most of them are liars. And as for the poets, the deviators follow them. Have you not seen that they wander in every valley? And that they say what they do not do? Except for those who believe and do righteous deeds and remember Allah much and defend themselves after they have been wronged. And those who do wrong will soon come to know to what [final] return they will be returned."
27:1-6	These are the verses of the Qur’an and a clear Book, a guidance and good tidings for the believers - those who establish prayer and give zakah, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith]. Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter - We have made their deeds pleasing to them, so they wander blindly. Those are the ones for whom is the worst punishment, and they, in the Hereafter, will be the greatest losers. And indeed, you receive the Qur’an from One Who is Wise and Knowing.
27:7-14	"When Moses said to his family, ""Indeed, I have perceived a fire. I will bring you from it information or bring you a burning torch that you may warm yourselves."" And when he came to it, he was called, ""Blessed are those in the Fire and those around it. And exalted is Allah, Lord of the worlds."" ""O Moses! Indeed, I am Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" And throw down your staff. But when he saw it writhing as if it were a serpent, he turned in flight and did not look back. ""O Moses! Fear not. Indeed, no messengers fear in My presence. Except for he who has done wrong and then substituted evil for good. Indeed, I am Forgiving and Merciful. And put your hand into the bosom of your garment; it will come out white without disease. [This is] nine signs to Pharaoh and his people. Indeed, they were a people of wickedness."" But when Our clear signs came to them, they said, ""This is obvious magic."" And they denied them, while their souls were convinced thereof, out of injustice and arrogance. So see how was the end of the corrupters."
27:15-19	"And We had certainly given knowledge to David and Solomon, and they said, ""Praise be to Allah, who has favored us over many of His believing servants."" And Solomon inherited David and said, ""O mankind, we have been taught the language of birds, and we have been given of all things. Indeed, this is clearly bounty."" And there were gathered for Solomon his soldiers of jinn and men and birds, and they were being driven in ranks. Until, when they came to the Valley of the Ants, an ant said, ""O ants, enter your dwellings lest Solomon and his soldiers crush you while they perceive not."" So he smiled, laughing at her statement and said, ""My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve. And admit me by Your mercy into [the ranks of] Your righteous servants."""
27:20-28	"And he inspected the birds and said, ""What is the matter with me that I do not see the hoopoe, or is he among the absent? I will surely punish him with a severe punishment or slaughter him, or he must bring me clear authority."" But he remained not long. Then he said, ""I have encompassed that which you have not encompassed, and I have come to you from Sheba with sure news. Indeed, I found a woman ruling them, and she has been given of all things, and she has a mighty throne. I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of Allah. And Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from the way, so they are not guided. Will they not prostrate to Allah, who brings forth what is hidden in the heavens and the earth and knows what you conceal and what you declare? Allah - there is no god except Him - Lord of the Mighty Throne."" He said, ""We will see whether you have told the truth or are among the liars. Go with this letter of mine and deliver it to them; then turn away from them and see what they return."""
27:29-37	"She said, ""O eminent ones, indeed a noble letter has been delivered to me. It is from Solomon, and indeed, it reads, 'In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Do not exalt yourselves over me, but come to me in submission.'"" She said, ""O eminent ones, advise me in my affair. I will not decide a matter until you witness it."" They said, ""We are men of strength and great might, and the command is yours, so consider what you will command."" She said, ""Indeed, when kings enter a city, they corrupt it and abase the most honorable of its people. And thus they do. And indeed, I am going to be sent to them with a gift to see with what the messengers return."" But when he came to Solomon, he said, ""Do you provide me with wealth? For what Allah has given me is better than what He has given you. Rather, you rejoice in your gift. Go back to them, and we will surely come to them with soldiers they cannot withstand, and we will drive them out from it humiliated and debased."""
27:38-44	"He said, ""O eminent ones, which of you will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?"" An 'Ifrit from among the jinn said, ""I will bring it to you before you rise from your place, and indeed, I am for this [true] strong and trustworthy."" He who had knowledge of the Scripture said, ""I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you."" But when he saw it settled near him, he said, ""This is from the bounty of my Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful. And whoever is grateful is grateful only for himself. And whoever denies - then indeed, my Lord is Free of need and Generous."" He said, ""Disguise her throne for her; we will see whether she will be guided or will be among those who are not guided."" So when she came, it was said, ""Is this your throne?"" She said, ""It is as if it were it. And we were given knowledge before her, and we were Muslims."" And that which she used to worship besides Allah prevented her. Indeed, she was from a disbelieving people. It was said to her, ""Enter the palace."" But when she saw it, she thought it was a deep pool, and she uncovered her legs. He said, ""Indeed, it is a palace smooth of glass."" She said, ""My Lord! I have wronged myself, and I submit with Solomon to Allah, Lord of the worlds."""
27:45-53	"And We had certainly sent to Thamud their brother Salih, [saying], ""Worship Allah,"" but at once they were two parties disputing. He said, ""O my people, why do you hasten the evil before the good? Why do you not ask forgiveness of Allah that you may receive mercy?"" They said, ""We consider you and those with you to be an omen of evil."" He said, ""Your omen is with Allah. Rather, you are a people being tested."" And there were in the city nine men who were spreading corruption in the land and not reforming. They said, ""Swear by Allah that we will surely kill him and his family by night, then we will surely say to his guardian, 'We did not witness the destruction of his family, and indeed, we are truthful.'"" But they planned a plan, and We planned a plan, while they perceived not. So see how was the end of their plan - We destroyed them and their people, all together. Those are their houses, desolate because of what they had done. Indeed in that is a sign for a people who know. And We saved those who believed and were fearing Allah."
27:54-58	And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, “Do you commit immorality while you are seeing? Do you indeed approach men with desire instead of women? Rather, you are a people behaving ignorantly.” And there was no answer to his people except that they said, “Expel the family of Lot from your city. Indeed, they are people who keep themselves pure.” So We saved him and his family, except for his wife; We destined her to be among those who remained behind. And We rained down upon them a rain - and evil was the rain of those who were warned.
27:59-66	"Say, ""Praise be to Allah, and peace be upon His chosen servants. Is Allah better than what they associate with Him? Is He who created the heavens and the earth and sent down for you from the sky water, and We caused to grow thereby gardens of delight - it was not for you to cause the trees thereof to grow? Is there a deity with Allah? Rather, they are a people who ascribe equals? Is He who made the earth a stable place and placed within it rivers and placed for it firm mountains and placed between the two seas a barrier? Is there a deity with Allah? Rather, most of them do not know? Is He who answers the distressed when he calls upon Him and removes evil and makes you successors on the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Little do you remember? Is He who guides you through the darknesses of the land and sea and who sends the winds as good tidings before His mercy? Is there a deity with Allah? Exalted is Allah above what they associate with Him? Is He who begins creation and then repeats it, and who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? Is there a deity with Allah? Say, ""Produce your proof, if you should be truthful."" Say, ""None in the heavens and the earth knows the unseen except Allah, and they do not perceive when they will be resurrected."" Rather, their knowledge will comprehend only the Hereafter. Rather, they are in doubt thereof. Rather, they are blind thereto."
27:67-75	"And those who disbelieve say, ""When we are dust, and our fathers, will we indeed be brought forth?"" We were already promised this, we and our fathers before. This is not but legends of the ancients. Say, ""Travel through the land and observe what was the end of the criminals. And do not grieve over them and do not be in distress over what they plot."" And they say, ""When will this promise come to pass, if you should be truthful?"" Say, ""Perhaps there will be some of that which you are hastening upon after you."" And indeed, your Lord is full of bounty to mankind, but most of them do not give thanks. And indeed, your Lord knows what their breasts conceal and what they declare. And there is nothing hidden within the heaven or earth except that it is in a clear register."
27:76-78	This Qur’an relates to the Children of Israel most of that over which they differ. And indeed, it is guidance and mercy for the believers. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them with His judgment. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Knowing.
27:79-81	So rely upon Allah, indeed, you are upon the clear truth. Indeed, you cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and depart. And you cannot guide the blind from their error. You can only make hear those who believe in Our verses, and they are Muslims.
27:82-88	And when the word comes to pass against them, We will bring forth for them a creature from the earth that will speak to them, [saying], “O mankind, [O Muhammad] ...
27:89-93	"Whoever brings a good deed will have better than it, and they, from the terror of that Day, will be secure. But whoever brings an evil deed, their faces will be thrown into the Fire. Are you recompensed except for what you used to do? I have only been commanded to worship the Lord of this city, who has made it sacred, and to Him belongs all things. And I have been commanded to be of the Muslims [in submission], and to recite the Qur’an. So whoever is guided is only guided for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever goes astray - say, ""I am only of the warners."" And say, ""Praise be to God. He will show you His signs, and you will recognize them. And your Lord is not unaware of what you do."""
28:1-6	Ta, Mim. These are the verses of the clear Book. We recite to you, [O Muhammad], from the news of Moses and Pharaoh, in truth, for a people who believe. Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a party of them, slaughtering their sons and keeping their women alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters. And We desired to bestow a favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors. And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers from them that which they feared.
28:7-13	"And We inspired the mother of Moses, ""Suckle him, but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him one of the messengers."" But the family of Pharaoh picked him up, so that he might be to them an enemy and a grief. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers were sinners. And the wife of Pharaoh said, ""A comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son,"" while they perceive not. And the heart of Moses' mother became empty. She almost disclosed him had We not strengthened her heart so that she might be of the believers. And she said to his sister, ""Follow him,"" and she watched him from afar while they perceived not. And We had forbidden him wet nurses before. She said, ""Shall I direct you to a family who will take care of him for you and be sincere to him?"" So We restored him to his mother that her eye may be comforted and she not grieve and that she may know that the promise of Allah is truth, but most of them do not know."
28:14-19	"And when he reached his full strength and was of sound mind, We gave him judgment and knowledge. Thus do We reward the doers of good. And he entered the city at a time when its people were unaware, and he found therein two men fighting, one of his party and the other of his enemy. The one of his party called for help against the one of his enemy, so Moses struck him and killed him. He said, ""This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a clear, misleading enemy."" He said, ""My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me."" So He forgave him. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful. He said, ""My Lord, because You have bestowed favor upon me, I will never be a supporter of the criminals."" So he entered the city fearfully, watching, and behold, he who had sought his help the day before called for his help. Moses said to him, ""Indeed, you are clearly in error."" But when he intended to strike the one who was an enemy to them both, he said, ""O Moses, do you wish to kill me as you killed a person yesterday? You only desire to be a tyrant upon the earth. And you do not desire to be among the reformers."""
28:20-21	"And a man came running from the farthest part of the city. He said, ""O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conspiring against you to kill you, so go out. Indeed, I am to you among the sincere advisers."" So he went out from it, fearful and waiting. He said, ""My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people."""
28:22-28	"And when he set out toward Madyan, he said, ""Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the right way."" And when he came to the watering place of Madyan, he found there a group of people watering their flocks, and he found besides them two women holding back their flocks. He said, ""What is the matter with you?"" They said, ""We do not water [our flocks] until the shepherds depart, and our father is an old man."" So he watered their flocks for them, then turned to the shade and said, ""My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You may send down to me, in need."" Then one of the two women came to him, walking shyly. She said, ""Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered our flocks for us."" So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, ""Fear not; you have been saved from the wrongdoing people."" One of the two women said, ""O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and trustworthy."" He said, ""Indeed, I want to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that you serve me for eight years. But if you complete ten, it will be of your own accord. And I do not want to make it difficult for you. You will find me, if Allah wills, among the righteous."" He said, ""That is between me and you. Whichever of the two terms you complete, there will be no aggression against me. And Allah, over what we say, is Witness."""
28:29-32	"When Moses had fulfilled the term and was travelling with his family, he perceived a fire on the side of the mount. He said to his family, ""Wait here; I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I can bring you some information from it or a burning ember from the fire that you may warm yourselves."" But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the valley, in the blessed spot, from the tree, ""O Moses, indeed I am Allah, Lord of the worlds. And throw down your staff."" But when he saw it writhing as if it were a snake, he turned and fled and did not look back. ""O Moses, come forward and fear not; indeed, you are of those who are secure. Put your hand into the bosom of your garment; it will come out white without disease. And draw close to yourself your wing from fear. These are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. Indeed, they were a wicked people."""
28:33-35	"He said, ""My Lord, indeed I have killed one of them, and I fear that they will kill me. And my brother Aaron is more eloquent than I in speech, so send him with me as a support to confirm me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me."" He said, ""We will strengthen you through your brother, and give you both authority so that they will not reach you with Our signs. You and those who follow you will be the predominant."""
28:36-43	"So when Moses came to them with Our clear signs, they said, ""This is not but invented magic, and we have not heard of this among our forefathers of old."" And Moses said, ""My Lord is most knowing of who has brought guidance from Him and of who will have the final home. Indeed, the wrongdoers will not succeed."" And Pharaoh said, ""O eminent ones, I do not know of any god for you other than me. So kindle for me, O Haman, upon the clay, and make for me a tower that I may look up to the God of Moses. And indeed, I think he is of the liars."" And he and his soldiers were arrogant upon the land without right, and they thought that to Us they would not be returned. So We seized him and his soldiers and cast them into the sea. Then see how was the end of the wrongdoers. And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be aided. And We pursued them with a curse in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be among the despised. And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture after We destroyed the former generations as insight for the people and guidance and mercy that perhaps they would be reminded."
28:44-46	You were not on the western side when We gave Moses the command, nor were you among the witnesses. But We raised up generations, and life was prolonged for them. And you were not dwelling among the people of Madyan, reciting to them Our verses, but We were messengers. And you were not on the side of the mount when We called. But [it was] a mercy from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner had come before you, that perhaps they will be reminded.
28:47-50	And had it not been that a disaster should strike them for what their hands have put forth, they would say, “Our Lord, why did you not send to us a messenger so we could follow Your signs and be among the believers?” But when the truth came to them from Us, they said, “Why was he not given the like of what was given to Moses?” Did they not disbelieve in what was given to Moses before? They said, “Two magics supporting each other.” And they said, “Indeed, we are disbelievers in both.” Say, “Then bring a scripture from Allah that is better guidance than both of them, that I may follow it, if you should be truthful.” But if they do not respond to you, then know that they only follow their own desires. And who is more astray than he who follows his desire without guidance from Allah? Indeed, Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
28:51-56	"And We have certainly conveyed to them the Word that perhaps they will remember. Those to whom We gave the Scripture before it - they believe in it. And when it is recited to them, they say, ""We believe in it; indeed, it is the truth from our Lord. Indeed, we were, before it, Muslims."" Those will be given their reward twice for what they patiently endured and avert evil with good, and they spend from what We have provided them. And when they hear ill speech, they turn away from it and say, ""To us are our deeds, and to you are your deeds. Peace be upon you. We seek not the ignorant."" Indeed, you do not guide whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He is most knowing of the [rightly] guided."
28:57-59	"They say, ""If we follow the guidance with you, we will be snatched away from our land."" Have We not established for them a secure sanctuary to which are brought the fruits of all things as provision from Us? But most of them do not know. And how many a city have We destroyed that was insolent in its life? Those were their dwellings; they were not inhabited after them except a little, and it was We who were the inheritors. And your Lord would not destroy cities until He had sent to their mother a messenger reciting to them Our verses. And We would not destroy cities except while their people were wrongdoers."
28:60-67	"Whatever you have been given is but the enjoyment of worldly life and its adornment. But what is with Allah is better and more lasting. Then will you not reason? Is he to whom We have promised a good promise and he will attain it like he to whom We have given enjoyment of worldly life and then, on the Day of Resurrection, will he be among those brought forth? And the Day He will call to them and say, ""Where are My associates about whom you claimed?"" Those upon whom the Word has come into effect will say, ""Our Lord, these are the ones we misled - we misled them as we were misled. We disavow ourselves before You - they did not worship us."" And it was said, ""Call upon your associates."" So they called upon them, but they did not respond to them, and they saw the punishment, had they only been guided. And the Day He will call to them and say, ""What was your response to the messengers?"" And the news will be hidden from them that Day, so they will not ask about one another. But as for he who repents, believes, and does righteousness, perhaps he will be among the successful."
28:68-75	"And your Lord creates what He wills and chooses. It is not for them to choose. Glory be to Allah, and He is far above what they associate with Him. And your Lord knows what their hearts conceal and what they declare. And He is Allah - there is no deity except Him. To Him be praise in the first and the last, and His is the judgement, and to Him you will be returned. Say, ""Have you considered, if Allah made the night continuous for you until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than Allah could bring you light? Then will you not hear?"" Say, ""Have you considered, if Allah made the day continuous for you until the Day of Resurrection, what god other than Allah could bring you night in which to rest? Then will you not see?"" And out of His mercy He made for you the night and the day that you may rest therein and that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful. And the Day He will call to them and say, ""Where are My associates whom you used to claim?"" And We will extract from every nation a witness and say, ""Produce your proof."" So they will know that the truth belongs to Allah, and lost from them is that which they used to invent."
28:76-80	"Indeed, Korah was of the people of Moses, but he oppressed them, and We had given him of treasures, the keys of which would have been a burden to a band of strong men. When his people said to him, ""Do not exult. Indeed, Allah does not like the exultant. But seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and do not neglect your portion of this world. And do good as Allah has been good to you, and seek not corruption on the earth. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters."" He said, ""It has only been given to me because of knowledge I have."" Did he not know that Allah had destroyed before him generations greater in strength and greater in accumulation? And the criminals are not asked about their sins. Then he came out before his people in his adornment. Those who desired the life of this world said, ""Oh, would that we had like that which Korah has been given. Indeed, he is one of great fortune."" And those who were given knowledge said, ""Woe to you! The reward of Allah is better for whoever believes and does righteousness. And none is granted it except the steadfast."""
28:81-84	So We caused the earth to swallow him and his home. And there was for him no company to aid him other than Allah, nor was he among those who could defend themselves. And those who had wished to be in his place the day before began to say, “It is as if Allah enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts it. Had it not been for Allah’s favor upon us, He would have caused the earth to swallow us up.” And it is as if the disbelievers would not succeed. That is the home of the Hereafter We assign to those who do not desire exaltedness upon the earth or corruption. And the [best] outcome is for the righteous. Whoever brings a good deed will have better than it, but whoever brings an evil deed - then not will those who do evil be recompensed except for what they used to do.
28:85-88	Indeed, He who imposed the Qur’an upon you will surely bring you back to a place of return. Say, “My Lord is most knowing of who has brought guidance and who is in clear error.” And you did not expect that the Book would be revealed to you except as a mercy from your Lord. So never be a supporter of the disbelievers. And do not let them avert you from the verses of Allah after they have been revealed to you. And invite to your Lord and do not be of those who associate others with Him. And do not invoke with Allah another deity. There is no deity except Him. Everything will perish except His Face. To Him belongs the judgement, and to Him you will be returned.
29:1-7	"Alif, Lam, Meem. Do people think that they will be left to say, ""We believe"" and they will not be tested? And We have certainly tested those before them - so Allah will surely make evident those who are truthful and He will surely make evident the liars. Or do those who do evil deeds think that they can outpace Us? Evil is that which they judge. Whoever hopes for the meeting with Allah - then indeed, the term appointed by Allah is coming, and He is the Hearing, the Knowing. And whoever strives only strives for himself. Indeed, Allah is free from need of the worlds. But those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely remove from them their misdeeds and will surely reward them according to the best of what they used to do."
29:8-9	And We have enjoined upon man, to his parents, good treatment. But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them. To Me is your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do. And those who believe and do righteous deeds - We will surely admit them among the righteous.
29:10-13	"And among the people is he who says, ""We believe in Allah,"" but when he is harmed for the cause of Allah, he considers the trial of the people to be like the punishment of Allah. But if victory comes from your Lord, they will surely say, ""Indeed, we were with you."" Is not Allah best aware of what is within the breasts of the worlds? And Allah will surely make evident those who believe, and He will surely make evident the hypocrites. And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, ""Follow our way, and we will bear your sins."" But they will not bear any of their sins. Indeed, they are liars. And they will surely bear their own burdens and other burdens besides their burdens, and they will be asked on the Day of Resurrection about what they used to invent."
29:14-15	And We had certainly sent Noah to his people, and he remained among them a thousand years minus fifty years, and the flood seized them while they were wrongdoers. But We saved him and the companions of the ark and made it a sign for the worlds.
29:16-18	"And [mention] Abraham, when he said to his people, ""Worship God and fear Him. That is better for you, if you only knew."" You only worship idols besides God and invent falsehood. Indeed, those you worship besides God do not possess for you any provision. So seek provision from God and worship Him and be grateful to Him. To Him you will be returned. And if you deny, then nations before you denied. And the Messenger has no duty except to convey clearly."
29:19-23	"Have they not seen how Allah originates creation and then repeats it? Indeed, that, for Allah, is easy. Say, ""Travel through the earth and observe how He originated creation. Then Allah will produce the final creation. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. He punishes whom He wills and has mercy on whom He wills, and to Him you will be returned. And you will not cause failure upon the earth or in the heaven, and you have not besides Allah any protector or helper. And those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah and in the meeting with Him - those have despaired of My mercy, and those will have a painful punishment."
29:24-27	"But the only answer of his people was that they said, ""Kill him or burn him."" But Allah saved him from the Fire. Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe. And he said, ""You have only taken idols besides Allah out of affection among yourselves in worldly life. But on the Day of Resurrection some of you will disbelieve in others and curse one another, and your refuge will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers."" So Lot believed him and said, ""Indeed, I will emigrate to my Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob, and We placed among his descendants prophethood and scripture. And We gave him his reward in this world, and indeed, in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous."
29:28-35	"And [mention] Lot, when he said to his people, ""Indeed, you commit an immorality such as no one before you has committed before among the worlds. Is it that you approach men and block the way and commit in your assemblies evil?"" And there was no answer to his people except that they said, ""Bring us the punishment of Allah, if you should be of the truthful."" He said, ""My Lord, help me against the corrupting people."" And when Our messengers came to Abraham with the good tidings, they said, ""Indeed, we are going to destroy the people of this city. Indeed, its people have been wrongdoers."" He said, ""Indeed, within it is Lot."" They said, ""We know best who is within it. We will surely save him and his family, except his wife; she will be among those who remain behind."" And when Our messengers came to Lot, he was distressed because of them and felt straitened for them, and they said, ""Do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will save you and your family. Except for your wife; she will be among those who remain behind."" Indeed, We are going to send down upon the people of this city a punishment from the sky because they used to defiantly disobey. And We have certainly left therein a clear sign for a people who use reason."
29:36-37	And to Madyan [We sent] their brother Shuaib. He said, “O my people, worship Allah and hope for the Last Day and do not commit abuse on the earth, spreading corruption.” But they denied him, so the earthquake seized them, and they became within their homes fallen down.
29:38-40	And 'Aad and Thamud - and their dwellings have become clear to you. And Satan has made their deeds pleasing to them and averted them from the way, while they were insightful. And Korah and Pharaoh and Haman - and indeed Moses had come to them with clear proofs, but they were arrogant upon the land and were not forerunners. So We seized each for his sin. And among them was he upon whom We sent a storm of stones, and among them was he whom the shriek seized, and among them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow, and among them was he whom We drowned. And Allah would not wrong them, but they were wronging themselves.
29:41-43	The parable of those who take protectors other than Allah is that of the spider who takes a home. And indeed, the flimsiest of homes is the spider’s home, if they only knew. Indeed, Allah knows whatever they invoke besides Him, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. And these examples We present to the people, but none grasps them except those of knowledge.
29:44-45	Allah created the heavens and the earth in truth. Indeed in that is a sign for the believers. Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do.
29:46-47	"And do not argue with the People of the Scripture except in a way that is best, except for those who commit injustice among them, and say, ""We believe in that which was revealed to us and revealed to you. And our God and your God is one, and we are Muslims [in submission] to Him."" And thus We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], the Book. So those to whom We gave the Scripture believe in it. And among these are some who believe in it. And none reject Our verses except the disbelievers."
29:48-52	"You did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe it with your right hand; then the falsifiers would have had doubts. Rather, it is clear verses within the breasts of those who have been given knowledge. And none reject Our verses except the wrongdoers. And they say, ""Why were verses not sent down to him from his Lord?"" Say, ""The verses are only with God, and I am only a clear warner."" Was it not sufficient for them that We sent down to you the Book which is recited to them? Indeed in that is a mercy and a reminder for a people who believe. Say, ""Sufficient is God between me and you as a Witness. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth."" But those who believe in falsehood and disbelieve in God - it is they who are the losers."
29:53-55	"And they ask you to hasten the punishment. And were it not for a specified term, the punishment would have come upon them. And it will come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive. They ask you to hasten the punishment. And indeed, Hell will encompass the disbelievers. The Day the punishment will cover them from above them and from beneath their feet and He will say, ""Taste what you used to do."""
29:56-60	O My servants who have believed, indeed My earth is spacious, so worship Me. Every soul will taste death, then to Us you will be returned. And those who have believed and done righteous deeds - We will surely assign them lofty rooms in Paradise beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Excellent is the reward of the workers - those who are patient and upon their Lord rely. And how many a creature carries not its own provision? Allah provides for it and for you. And He is the Hearing, the Knowing.
29:61-69	"And if you ask them, ""Who created the heavens and the earth and subjected the sun and the moon?"" they will surely say, ""Allah."" So how are they deluded? Allah enlarges provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts it. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things. And if you ask them, ""Who sends down water from the sky and revives the earth thereby after its lifelessness?"" they will surely say, ""Allah."" Say, ""Praise be to Allah."" But most of them do not reason. And what is this worldly life except diversion and amusement. And the home of the Hereafter - that is the life, if only they knew. But when they embark on a ship, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He brings them safe to land, at once they associate others with Him [in worship], [that they may] disbelieve in what We have given them and enjoy themselves. They are going to know. Have they not seen that We have made a secure sanctuary, while people are being snatched away all around them? Then is it in falsehood that they believe, and in the favor of Allah that they deny? And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah or denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell an abode for the disbelievers? And those who strive for Us - We will surely guide them to Our ways. And indeed, Allah is with the doers of good."
30:1-7	Alif, Lam, Meem. The Romans have been defeated. In the lowest land, but after their defeat they will overcome. Within three to nine years. To Allah belongs the command before and after. And that Day the believers will rejoice. In the victory of Allah He gives victory to whom He wills. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful. [It is] the promise of Allah - Allah does not fail in His promise, but most of the people do not know. They know only the outward appearance of the worldly life, but of the Hereafter they are heedless.
30:8-16	Have they not reflected within themselves? Allah did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth and for a specified term. And indeed, many of the people, concerning the meeting with their Lord, are disbelievers. Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them? They were mightier than them in strength and tilled the earth and developed it more than they developed it. And there came to them their messengers with clear proofs. So it was not Allah that would wrong them, but they were wronging themselves. Then the end of those who did evil was the worst, because they denied the signs of Allah and used to ridicule them. Allah originates creation; then He will repeat it, then to Him you will be returned. And on the Day the Hour appears, the criminals will be in despair. And they will have no intercessors from among their associates, and they will be, in their associates, disbelievers. And on the Day the Hour appears, that Day they will be dispersed. Then as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, they will be in a garden, rejoicing. But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter - those will be brought to the punishment.
30:17-27	So glory be to Allah when you reach the evening and when you reach the morning. And to Him be praise in the heavens and the earth, and in the evening and when you reach the noonday. He brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living. And He gives life to the earth after its lifelessness, and thus you will be brought forth. And among His signs is that He created you from dust; then, behold, you are human beings dispersing. And among His signs is that He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may find tranquility in them, and He put between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought. And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages ​​and colors. Indeed in that are signs for those of knowledge. And among His signs is your sleep by night and by day, and your seeking of His bounty. Indeed in that are signs for a people who listen. And among His signs is that He shows you lightning, [causing] fear and hope, and He sends down water from the sky and gives life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason. And among His signs is that the heaven and the earth stand by His command; then, when He calls you with one call from the earth, at once, you come forth. And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth, all devoutly obedient to Him. It is He who begins creation and then repeats it, and that is easier for Him. And to Him belongs the highest description in the heavens and the earth. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
30:28-32	He has set forth for you an example from yourselves: Do you have among those whom your right hands possess any partners in what We have provided for you so that you would be equal therein? You fear them as you fear yourselves. Thus do We detail the verses for a people who use reason. Rather, those who do wrong follow their own desires without knowledge. So who will guide whom Allah has sent astray? And they will have no helpers. So direct your face toward the religion, inclining to truth. [Adhere to] the nature of Allah upon which He has created mankind. No change should there be in the creation of Allah. That is the right religion, but most people do not know. Turn [to Him], and fear Him and establish prayer and do not be of those who associate others with Allah. [Adhere to] those who have divided their religion and become sects, every faction rejoicing in what it has.
30:33-37	And when harm touches people, they invoke their Lord, turning to Him in repentance. Then when He lets them taste mercy from Him, at once a party of them associate others with their Lord, that they may disbelieve in what We have given them, so enjoy yourselves and you will soon know. Or have We sent down to them authority so that he would speak of what they used to associate with Him? And when We let people taste mercy, they rejoice therein; but if evil befalls them for what their hands have put forth, at once they despair. Do they not see that Allah extends provision to whom He wills and restricts it? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe.
30:38-41	So give to the relative his right and [also] to the needy and the traveler. That is best for those who desire the countenance of Allah . And it is those who will be successful. And whatever you give in interest that it may increase within the people's wealth - it does not increase with Allah. And whatever you give in zakat, desiring the countenance of Allah - it is those who will be multiplied. Allah is He who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die, then will bring you to life. Is there among your associates any who does any of that? Glory be to Him, and exalted is He above what they associate with Him. Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea because of what the hands of people have earned so He may let them taste some of what they have done that perhaps they will return.
30:42-45	"Say, ""Travel through the land and observe what was the end of those before. Most of them were polytheists. So direct your face toward the right religion before there comes from Allah a Day from which there is no repelling. That Day they will be divided. Whoever disbelieves - upon him is his disbelief, and whoever does righteousness - it is for themselves that they prepare [for themselves] - that He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds out of His bounty. Indeed, He does not like the disbelievers."""
30:46-53	And among His signs is that He sends the winds as good tidings and that He may give you a taste of His mercy and that the ships may sail by His command and that you may seek of His bounty; perhaps you will be grateful. And We had already sent before you messengers to their people, and they came to them with clear proofs, so We took retribution from those who committed crimes; and it was incumbent upon Us to support the believers. It is Allah who sends the winds, and they stir up the clouds, then He spreads them in the sky however He wills, and makes them into fragments, and you see the rain emerge from within them. Then when He afflicts with it whom He wills of His servants, at once they rejoice. Although they were, before that which descended upon them from before that, in despair. So look at the traces of Allah's mercy - how He revives the earth after its lifelessness. Indeed, that is the Giver of Life to the dead, and He is over all things competent. And if We send a wind and they see it yellow, they will continue to disbelieve after that. For indeed, you cannot make the dead hear, nor can you make the deaf hear the call when they turn their backs and depart. And you cannot guide the blind from their error. You can only make hear those who believe in Our verses, and they are Muslims.
30:54-54	God is He who created you from weakness, then made after weakness strength, then made after strength weakness and gray hair. He creates what He wills, and He is the Knowing, the Competent.
30:55-60	"And on the Day the Hour will appear, the criminals will swear that they had not remained [in the world] except for an hour. Thus were they deluded. And those who were given knowledge and faith will say, ""Indeed, you have remained in the Book of Allah until the Day of Resurrection."" This is the Day of Resurrection, but you did not know. So on that Day, the excuse of those who did wrong will not benefit them, nor will they be asked to repent. And We have certainly presented for the people in this Qur'an every [kind of] example. And if you bring them a sign, those who disbelieve will surely say, ""You are not but falsifiers."" Thus does Allah set a seal upon the hearts of those who do not know. So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And do not let those who have no certainty impress you."
31:1-5	Alif, Lam, Meem. These are the verses of the Wise Book, a guidance and a mercy for the doers of good - those who establish prayer and give zakah, and of the Hereafter they are certain [in faith]. Those are upon [right] guidance from their Lord, and it is those who are the successful.
31:6-9	And among the people is he who buys the amusement of speech to mislead [people] from the way of Allah without knowledge and takes it in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment. And when Our verses are recited to him, he turns away arrogantly as if he had not heard them, as if there was deafness in his ears. So give him tidings of a painful punishment. Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens of pleasure, abiding therein eternally. [It is] the promise of Allah in truth, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
31:10-11	He created the heavens without pillars that you can see, and He cast into the earth firm mountains, lest it should shift with you, and He dispersed therein every [kind of] creature. And We sent down water from the sky, and caused to grow therein every [kind of] noble pair. This is the creation of Allah, so show me what those other than Him have created. Rather, the wrongdoers are in manifest error.
31:12-13	And We had certainly given Luqman wisdom, [saying], “Be grateful to Allah. And whoever is grateful is grateful for [the benefit of] himself. And whoever denies - then indeed, Allah is Free of need and Praiseworthy.” And when Luqman said to his son while he was advising him, “O my son, do not associate anything with Allah. Indeed, association is a great injustice.”
31:14-15	"And We have enjoined upon man, concerning his parents - his mother carried him, with weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is thirty months - [saying], ""Be grateful to Me and to your parents; to Me is the final destination."" But if they endeavor to make you associate with Me that of which you have no knowledge, do not obey them but accompany them in this world with appropriate kindness and follow the way of those who turn back to Me. Then to Me is your return, and I will inform you about what you used to do."
31:16-19	O my son, indeed if it be the weight of a grain of mustard seed and be within a rock or in the heavens or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Indeed, Allah is Subtle and Acquainted. O my son, establish prayer, enjoin what is right, forbid what is wrong, and be patient over what befalls you. Indeed, [all] that is of the matters [requiring] determination. And do not turn your cheek [in contempt] toward people and do not walk through the earth exultantly. Indeed, Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful. And be moderate in your pace and lower your voice. Indeed, the most disagreeable of sounds is the braying of donkeys.
31:20-26	"Have you not seen that Allah has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth and has completed His favors upon you, both apparent and hidden? And among the people is he who disputes about Allah without knowledge or guidance or an enlightening Book. And when it is said to them, ""Follow what Allah has revealed,"" they say, ""Rather, we will follow that upon which we found our fathers."" Even if Satan were inviting them to the punishment of the Blaze? And whoever submits his face to Allah while he is a doer of good has grasped the most trustworthy handhold. And to Allah is the outcome of all matters. And whoever disbelieves - let not his disbelief grieve you. To Us is their return, and We will inform them of what they did. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of that within the breasts. We provide for them for a little; then We will force them to a severe punishment. And if you ask them, ""Who created the heavens and the earth?"" they will surely say, ""Allah."" Say, ""Praise be to Allah."" But most of them do not know. To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy."
31:27-28	And if all the trees on the earth were pens and the sea, with seven more seas to replenish it, were ink, the Words of God could not be exhausted. Indeed, God is Exalted in Might and Wise. He did not create you and resurrect you except as a single soul. Indeed, God is Hearing and Seeing.
31:29-32	Have you not seen that Allah merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night and has subjected the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term? And that Allah, with what you do, is Acquainted. That is because Allah is the Truth, and that which they invoke besides Him is falsehood, and because Allah is the Most High, the Grand. Have you not seen that the ships sail upon the sea by the grace of Allah that He may show you some of His signs? Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful. And when waves cover them like canopies, they supplicate Allah, sincere to Him in religion. But when He brings them safe to land, then among them is he who is moderate. And none rejects Our signs except every treacherous, ungrateful person.
31:33-34	O mankind, fear your Lord and dread a Day when no father will avail his son, nor will a son avail his father at all. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. So let not the worldly life delude you, and let not the Deceiver delude you about Allah. Indeed, Allah has knowledge of the Hour. He sends down the rain and knows what is in the wombs. And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.
32:1-3	Alif, Lam, Meem. The revelation of the Book is from the Lord of the worlds. Or do they say, “He has invented it?” Rather, it is the truth from your Lord that you may warn a people to whom no warner came before you that they may be guided.
32:4-9	It is Allah who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, then He established Himself on the Throne. You have not besides Him any protector or intercessor. Then will you not remember? He directs the affair from the heaven to the earth, then it will ascend to Him in a Day, the extent of which is a thousand years of those which you count. That is the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Exalted in Might, the Merciful. He who perfected everything which He created and began the creation of man from clay. Then He made his descendants from an extract of despised water. Then He proportioned him and breathed into him of His [created] spirit and made for you hearing and vision and hearts. Little do you give thanks.
32:10-14	"And they say, ""If we are lost in the earth, will we then be in a new creation?"" Rather, they, in the meeting with their Lord, are disbelievers. Say, ""The Angel of Death who is set over you will take you; then to your Lord you will be returned."" And if you could but see when the criminals hang their heads before their Lord, [saying], ""Our Lord, we have seen and heard, so return us [to Him]; we will do righteousness. Indeed, we are [now] certain."" And if We had willed, We could have given every soul its guidance, but the word from Me will come into effect, ""I will surely fill Hell with jinn and people all together."" So taste [something] for having forgotten the meeting with this Day of yours. Indeed, We have forgotten you. And taste the punishment of eternity for what you used to do."
32:15-17	Only those believe in Our verses who, when they are reminded of them, fall down in prostration and exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord, and they are not arrogant. Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend out of what We have provided them. No soul knows what has been hidden for them of comfort for their eyes as reward for what they used to do.
32:18-22	"Is he who is a believer like he who is a sinner? They are not equal. As for those who have believed and done righteous deeds, for them are the Gardens of Refuge as a reward for what they used to do. But as for those who were sinners, their refuge is the Fire. Whenever they wish to emerge from it, they will be returned to it and it will be said to them, ""Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny."" And We will surely make them taste of the lesser punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will return. And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of the verses of his Lord and then turns away from them? Indeed, We will take retribution from the criminals."
32:23-27	And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture, so be not in doubt about meeting it, and We made it a guidance for the Children of Israel. And We made from among them leaders guiding by Our command when they were patient and were certain by Our signs. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ. Have they not been guided? How many generations We destroyed before them who used to walk about in their dwellings? Indeed in that are signs. Then will they not hear? Have they not seen that We drive the water to the barren land and produce thereby crops from which their livestock and themselves eat? Then will they not see?
32:28-30	"And they say, ""When will this conquest be, if you should be truthful?"" Say, ""On the Day of Conquest, the faith of those who disbelieve will not benefit them, nor will they be reprieved."" So turn away from them and wait; indeed, they are waiting."
33:1-3	O Prophet, fear Allah and do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. And follow what is revealed to you from your Lord. Indeed, Allah is ever, with what you do, Acquainted. And rely upon Allah, and sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.
33:4-6	Allah has not made for any man two hearts within him, nor has He made your wives whom you declare to be your mothers, nor has He made your adopted sons your sons. That is what you say with your mouths, and Allah speaks the truth, and He guides to the way. Call them by the names of their fathers; that is more just in the sight of Allah. But if you do not know their fathers, then they are your brothers in religion and your allies. And there is no blame upon you for that in which you have erred - [only] for [the purpose of] your hearts. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful. The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves, and his wives are their mothers. And those of kinship are closer to one another in the Book of Allah than the believers and the emigrants, unless you do to your allies a kindness. That is already inscribed in the Book.
33:7-8	And when We took a covenant from the prophets, and from you, and from Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, the son of Mary, and We took from them a solemn covenant, that He might question the truthful concerning their truthfulness, and He has prepared for the disbelievers a painful punishment.
33:9-17	"O you who have believed, remember the favor of Allah upon you when there came upon you hosts, and We sent upon them a wind and hosts you did not see. And ever is Allah, of what you do, Seeing. When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when eyes turned away and hearts reached to the throats and you assumed about Allah [various] assumptions. At that point the believers were tested and shaken with a severe earthquake. And when the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease said, ""Allah and His Messenger promised us nothing but delusion."" And when a party of them said, ""O people of Yathrib, there is no place for you to stay, so go back."" And a party of them asked permission of the Prophet, saying, ""Indeed, our houses are exposed."" But they are not exposed. They only desire to flee. And if they had entered upon them from its regions and then they were asked for trial, they would have come to it, and they would not have remained in it except a little. And they had already made a covenant with Allah before that they would not turn their backs, and the covenant with Allah will be questioned. Say, ""Fleeing will not benefit you if you flee from death or killing. And then you will not enjoy it except a little."" Say, ""Who is it that can protect you from God if He intends to harm you or intends to have mercy on you?"" And they will not find for themselves besides God any protector or helper."
33:18-20	"Allah knows those among you who hold back and say to their brothers, ""Come to us,"" but they do not come to battle except a little. They are niggardly toward you. But when fear comes, you see them looking at you, their eyes rolling like one who is fainting from death. But when the fear departs, they smite you with sharp tongues. They are niggardly toward good. Those have not believed, so Allah has rendered worthless their deeds, and that, for Allah, is easy. They think that the factions have not yet gone away. But when the factions come, they wish that they were wandering among the desert dwellers, asking about your news. And if they had been among you, they would not have fought except a little."
33:21-24	Indeed in the Messenger of Allah you have an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in Allah and the Last Day and [who] remembers Allah often. And when the believers saw the confederates, they said, “This is what Allah and His Messenger promised us,” and Allah and His Messenger spoke the truth. And it only increased them in faith and submission. Among the believers are men true to what they pledged to Allah. Among them is he who has fulfilled his vow [to the death], and among them is he who awaits [his chance]. And they have not changed [their commitment] in the least. That Allah may reward the truthful for their truthfulness and punish the hypocrites if He wills or accept their repentance. Indeed, Allah is ever Forgiving and Merciful.
33:25-27	And Allah repelled those who disbelieved in their fury; they did not attain any good. And Allah spared the believers the fighting. And Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might. And He brought down those who supported them from among the People of the Scripture from their strongholds and cast terror into their hearts. Some of them you killed and some you took captive. And He made you inherit their land and their homes and their properties and a land you had not trodden. And Allah is over all things competent.
33:28-31	O Prophet, say to your wives: If you desire the life of this world and its adornments, then come, I will provide for you and release you with a gracious release. But if you desire Allah and His Messenger and the home of the Hereafter, then indeed, Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward. O wives of the Prophet! Whoever among you commits a clear immorality - the punishment will be doubled for her twofold, and that, for Allah, is easy. But whoever among you is obedient to Allah and His Messenger and does righteousness - We will give her her reward twice over, and We have prepared for her a noble provision.
33:32-34	O wives of the Prophet, you are not like any other women. If you fear God, be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease should covet, but speak in an appropriate manner. And abide in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance. And establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah only desires to remove from you the uncleanness, O people of the Household, and to purify you with a thorough purification. And remember what is recited in your houses of the verses of Allah and wisdom. Indeed, Allah is ever Kind and Acquainted.
33:35-35	Verily, the Muslim men and Muslim women, the believing men and believing women, the obedient men and obedient women, the truthful men and truthful women, the patient men and patient women, the humble men and humble women, the charitable men and charitable women, the fasting men and fasting women, the men who guard their private parts and the women who do so, and the men who remember Allah often and the women who remember - for them Allah has prepared forgiveness and a great reward.
33:36-40	"It is not for a believing man or a believing woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter, that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly strayed into clear error. And when you said to him upon whom Allah had bestowed favor and you had bestowed favor, ""Keep your wife to yourself and fear Allah,"" while you concealed within yourself that which Allah was to disclose. And you feared the people, while Allah has more right that you should fear Him. But when Zaid had no longer any need for her, We married her to you in order that there should be no blame upon the believers concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they have no longer any need for them. And the command of Allah is to be done. There is no blame upon the Prophet for what Allah has ordained for him. This is the practice of Allah with those who passed on before. And the command of Allah is a decree decreed. Those who convey the messages of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone except Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant. Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets. And ever is Allah, of all things, Knowing."
33:41-44	O you who have believed, remember Allah with much remembrance. And exalt Him morning and evening. It is He who confers blessing upon you, and His angels [ask Him to do so] that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light. And ever is He, to the believers, Merciful. Their greeting on the Day they meet Him will be, “Peace.” And He has prepared for them a noble reward.
33:42-48	And glorify Him morning and evening. It is He who confers blessing upon you, and His angels [ask Him to do so], that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light. And ever is He, to the believers, Merciful. Their greeting on the Day they meet Him will be, “Peace.” And He has prepared for them a noble reward. O Prophet, indeed We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And one who invites to Allah, by His permission, and an illuminating lamp. And give good tidings to the believers that they will have from Allah great bounty. And do not obey the disbelievers and the hypocrites and ignore their abuse and rely upon Allah, and sufficient is Allah as Disposer of affairs.
33:49-52	O you who believe, when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you have touched them, then you have no waiting period to count for them. So provide for them and release them with gracious release. O Prophet, indeed We have made lawful to you your wives to whom you have given their dowries and those your right hand possesses from what Allah has given you and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you and a believing woman if she gives herself to the Prophet - if the Prophet wishes to marry her - exclusively for you, not for the believers. We know what We have enjoined upon them concerning their wives and those their right hands possess - so that there will be no difficulty for you. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful. You may put off whom you wish of them and take to yourself whom you wish. And as for whom you seek of those whom you have set aside - there is no blame upon you. That is more suitable that their eyes may be comforted and they will not grieve and they will be pleased with what you have given them all. And Allah knows what is in your hearts. And ever is Allah Knowing and Forbearing. It is not lawful for you to take other women after this, nor to exchange them for other wives, even if their beauty pleases you, except those your right hand possesses. And ever is God, over all things, a Watcher.
33:53-55	O you who have believed, do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, without awaiting its preparation. But when you are invited, then enter; and when you have eaten, disperse and do not seek entertainment for conversation. Indeed, that used to annoy the Prophet, and he would shy away from you. And God is not shy of the truth. And when you ask them for anything, ask them from behind a partition. That is purer for your hearts and their hearts. And it is not for you to annoy the Messenger of God or to marry his wives after him, ever. Indeed, that is in the sight of God an enormity. Whether you disclose a thing or conceal it, indeed, God is ever, of all things, Knowing. There is no blame upon them concerning their fathers, nor their sons, nor their brothers, nor their brothers' sons, nor their sisters' sons, nor their women, nor those their right hands possess. And fear God. Indeed, God is, over all things, Witness.
33:56-58	Indeed, Allah and His angels send blessings on the Prophet. O you who believe, send blessings on him and salute him with a worthy salutation. Indeed, those who abuse Allah and His Messenger - Allah has cursed them in this world and the Hereafter and has prepared for them a humiliating punishment. And those who abuse believing men and believing women for [something] other than what they have earned have certainly born upon themselves a slander and a manifest sin.
33:59-59	O Prophet, tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to bring down over themselves [part] of their outer garments. That is more suitable that they will be known and not be abused. And ever is God Forgiving and Merciful.
33:60-62	If the hypocrites and those in whose hearts is disease and the agitators in the city do not cease, We will surely incite you against them; then they will not remain your neighbors therein except for a little while. Cursed are they; wherever they are found, they will be seized and killed in a grievous slaughter. Such is the way of Allah with those who passed on before. And you will not find in the way of Allah any change.
33:63-68	"People ask you about the Hour. Say, ""Its knowledge is only with Allah. And what makes you know? Perhaps the Hour is near."" Indeed, Allah has cursed the disbelievers and prepared for them a Blaze. They will abide therein forever, never finding a protector or a helper. The Day their faces will be turned over in the Fire, they will say, ""If only we had obeyed Allah and obeyed the Messenger."" And they will say, ""Our Lord, indeed we obeyed our masters and our dignitaries, and they led us astray from the way."" Our Lord, give them double the punishment and curse them with a great curse."
33:69-71	O you who have believed, do not be like those who abused Moses; but Allah cleared him of what they said, and he was in the sight of Allah esteemed. O you who have believed, fear Allah and speak words of appropriate justice. He will amend for you your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger has certainly achieved a great attainment.
33:72-73	Indeed, We offered the Trust to the heavens and the earth and the mountains, and they declined to bear it and feared it; but man bore it. Indeed, he was unjust and ignorant. That Allah may punish the hypocrites, men and women, and the polytheists, men and women, and that Allah may accept the repentance of the believing men and women. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.
34:1-2	Praise be to God, to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and to Him be praise in the Hereafter. And He is the Wise, the Acquainted. He knows what enters into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein. And He is the Merciful, the Forgiving.
34:3-5	"Those who disbelieve say, ""The Hour will not come to us."" Say, ""Yes, by my Lord, it will come to you."" He is the Knower of the unseen. Not an atom's weight in the heavens or on the earth escapes Him, nor anything smaller than that or greater, but is in a clear register. That He may reward those who believe and do righteous deeds - those will have forgiveness and noble provision. But those who strive against Our verses to frustrate them - those will have a punishment of painful punishment."
34:6-9	"And those who have been given knowledge see that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth and guides to the path of the Almighty, the Praiseworthy. And those who disbelieve say, ""Shall we direct you to a man who will inform you that when you are completely torn apart, you will indeed be in a new creation?"" Has he invented a lie about Allah, or is there madness in him? Rather, those who do not believe in the Hereafter are in torment and far astray. Have they not seen what is before them and behind them of the heaven and the earth? If We will, We could cause the earth to swallow them up or cause a fragment of the sky to fall upon them. Indeed in that is a sign for every servant who turns [to Allah] in repentance."
34:10-13	"And We had certainly given David favor from Us, [saying], ""O mountains, echo with him, and [so do] the birds."" And We made iron soft for him, [saying], ""Make coats of mail and measure the links and work righteousness. Indeed, I, of what you do, am Seeing."" And to Solomon We subjected the wind, its morning journey being a month and its evening journey a month. And We caused a spring of molten copper to flow for him. And among the jinn were those who worked before him by permission of his Lord. And whoever of them deviated from Our command - We will make him taste of the punishment of the Blaze."" They made for him whatever he pleased of shrines and statues and basins like reservoirs and fixed cauldrons. ""Work, O family of David, in gratitude. But few of My servants are grateful."""
34:14-14	So when We decreed death for him, nothing showed them his death except a creature of the earth eating away at his staff. So when he fell down, the jinn realized that if they had known the unseen, they would not have remained in the humiliating punishment.
34:15-19	"There was for Sheba in their dwelling place a sign - two gardens on the right and on the left, [saying], ""Eat from the provision of your Lord and be grateful to Him. A good land and a Forgiving Lord."" But they turned away, so We sent upon them the flood of the dam and replaced their two gardens with two gardens bearing bitter fruit and tamarisk and some few lote trees. That is how We recompensed them for their disbelief. And do We recompense except the ungrateful? And We placed between them and the towns which We had blessed, towns easy to see, and We measured the distance between them: ""Travel therein nights and days in security."" But they said, ""Our Lord, lengthen between our journeys."" And they wronged themselves, so We made them stories and dispersed them completely. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful."
34:20-23	"And Satan proved true about them his assumption, so they followed him, except for a party of the believers. And he had no authority over them except that We might make evident who believes in the Hereafter from who is in doubt about it. And your Lord is, over all things, Guardian. Say, ""Call upon those you claim besides God. They do not possess an atom's weight in the heavens or on the earth, and they have no share in either of them, nor does He have among them any supporter."" And intercession with Him does not benefit except for one to whom He permits. Until, when fear is removed from their hearts, they say, ""What has your Lord said?"" They say, ""The truth."" And He is the Most High, the Grand."
34:24-27	"Say, ""Who provides for you from the heavens and the earth?"" Say, ""Allah. And indeed, either we or you are upon right guidance or in manifest error."" Say, ""You will not be asked about what we committed, nor will we be asked about what you do."" Say, ""Our Lord will gather us together, then He will judge between us in truth. And He is the Opener, the Knowing."" Say, ""Show me those whom you have associated with Him as partners."" No! Rather, He is Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise."
34:28-30	We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of the people do not know. And they say, “When will this promise come to pass, if you should be truthful?” Say, “You have an appointment on a Day from which you will not delay an hour, nor will you advance it.”
34:31-33	"And those who disbelieve say, ""We will not believe in this Qur'an, nor in that which is before it."" And if you could but see when the wrongdoers are made to stand before their Lord, returning their statement to one another. Those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, ""If it were not for you, we would have been believers."" Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed, ""Did we avert you from guidance after it had come to you? Rather, you were criminals."" And those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant, ""Rather, it was [your] plotting by night and by day when you ordered us to disbelieve in Allah and attribute to Him equals."" And they concealed regret when they saw the punishment, and We placed shackles on the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they recompensed except for what they used to do?"
34:34-39	"And We did not send to any city a warner but its affluent ones said, ""Indeed, we, in that with which you have been sent, are disbelievers."" And they said, ""We are more in wealth and children, and we will not be punished."" Say, ""Indeed, my Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills and restricts it,"" but most of the people do not know. And it is not your wealth or your children that bring you nearer to Us, except for those who believe and do righteousness. For those will be a double reward for what they did, and they will be in the chambers secure. And those who strive against Our verses, trying to frustrate them - those will be brought to the punishment. Say, ""Indeed, my Lord enlarges the provision for whom He wills of His servants and restricts it for him. And whatever you spend of a thing - He will replace it. And He is the Best of providers."""
34:40-45	"And the Day He will gather them all together, then He will say to the angels, ""Was it these that they used to worship?"" They will say, ""Glory be to You! You are our Protector instead of them. Rather, they used to worship the jinn; most of them were believers in them."" So this Day you will not possess for one another any benefit or harm, and We will say to those who did wrong, ""Taste the punishment of the Fire which you used to deny."" And when Our clear verses are recited to them, they will say, ""This is not but a man who wants to avert you from what your fathers used to worship."" And they will say, ""This is not but a fabricated lie."" And those who disbelieved will say of the truth when it has come to them, ""This is not but obvious magic."" And We did not give them any books to study, nor did We send to them before you any warner. And those before them denied, and they did not attain even a tenth of what We gave them. So they denied My messengers; so how terrible was My denial!"
34:46-47	"Say, ""I only admonish you of one thing: that you stand before God in pairs or individually and then reflect. There is no madness in your companion. He is only a warner to you before a severe punishment."" Say, ""Whatever reward I have asked of you is yours. My reward is only from God, and He is, over all things, Witness."""
34:48-54	"Say, ""Indeed, my Lord casts the truth. He is the Knower of the unseen."" Say, ""The truth has come, and falsehood neither originates nor restores."" Say, ""If I go astray, I only go astray to my own detriment; and if I am guided, it is by what my Lord reveals to me. Indeed, He is All-Hearing, All-Near."" And if you could but see when they are terrified, and there is no escape, and they are seized from a nearby place. And they say, ""We believe in it."" But how can they seize it from a distant place? And they disbelieved in it before, and they cast the unseen from a distant place. And a barrier will be placed between them and what they desire, as was done to their followers before. Indeed, they were in disquieting doubt."
35:1-4	Praise be to Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Who has made the angels messengers with wings, two or three or four. He increases in creation what He wills. Indeed, Allah is over all things competent. Whatever mercy Allah opens to the people, none can withhold it, and whatever He withholds, none can release it after Him. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. O mankind, remember the favor of Allah upon you. Is there a creator other than Allah who provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no deity except Him, so how are you deluded? And if they deny you, [O Muhammad] - so were messengers before you denied. And to Allah are matters returned.
35:5-8	O mankind, indeed the promise of Allah is truth, so let not the worldly life delude you and be not deceived about Allah by the Deceiver. Indeed, Satan is an enemy to you, so take him as an enemy. He only invites his party to be among the companions of the Blaze. Those who disbelieve will have a severe punishment. But those who believe and do righteous deeds will have forgiveness and a great reward. Then is he to whom the evil of his deed has been made attractive so he regards it as good? But Allah leaves astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. So let not your soul perish over them in regret. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of what they do.
35:9-11	And it is He who sends the winds, and they stir up the clouds, and We drive them to a dead land and revive thereby the earth after its lifelessness. Thus is the resurrection. Whoever desires honor - to Allah belongs all honor. To Him ascends the good word, and the righteous deed raises it. But those who plot evil deeds will have a severe punishment, and the plotting of those - it is they who will perish. And Allah created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then He made you mates. And no female conceives or gives birth except with His knowledge. And no soul lives long, nor does any soul shorten its life span, except that it is in a register. Indeed, that, for Allah, is easy.
35:12-14	And the two seas are not alike: one is fresh and sweet, palatable to drink, and the other is salty and bitter. And from each you eat tender meat and extract ornaments which you wear. And you see the ships plowing through it - that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful. He merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night. And He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running for a specified term. That is Allah, your Lord; to Him belongs the dominion. And those you call upon besides Him do not possess so much as a date stone. If you call upon them, they do not hear your call, and if they heard, they would not respond to you. And on the Day of Resurrection they will deny your association with Him. And none informs you like the One Acquainted.
35:15-18	O mankind, you are those in need of Allah, while Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy. If He wills, He can do away with you and bring forth a new creation. And that is not difficult for Allah. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. And if one heavily laden calls another to bear it, nothing of it will be borne, even if he were a near relative. You can only warn those who fear their Lord unseen and establish prayer. And whoever purifies himself only purifies himself for the benefit of his soul, and to Allah is the final destination.
35:19-26	The blind and the seeing are not alike. Nor are darkness and light. Nor is shade and heat. Nor are the living and the dead. Indeed, Allah makes hear whom He wills, but you cannot make hear those in the graves. You are only a warner. Indeed, We have sent you, [O Muhammad], with the truth as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. And there was no nation but that a warner had passed among them. And if they deny you, [O Muhammad], so also did those before them. Their messengers came to them with clear proofs and scriptures and an enlightening Scripture. Then I seized those who disbelieved - and how terrible was My reproach.
35:27-28	Have you not seen that God sends down water from the sky, and We produce thereby fruits of varying colors? And among the mountains are streaks white and red, varying in color and [some] very black. And among people and living creatures and grazing livestock are also varying in color. Only those fear God, from among His servants, who have knowledge. Indeed, God is Exalted in Might and Forgiving.
35:29-35	Indeed, those who recite the Book of Allah and establish prayer and spend from what We have provided for them, secretly and publicly, hope for a commerce that will never fail - That He may give them their rewards in full and increase them from His bounty. Indeed, He is Forgiving and Appreciative. And that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], of the Book is the truth, confirming what was before it. Indeed, Allah, of His servants, is Acquainted and Seeing. Then We caused to inherit the Book those We have chosen of Our servants. And among them is he who wrongs himself, and among them is he who is moderate, and among them is he who is foremost in good deeds by permission of Allah. That is the great bounty. [They will be] Gardens of Eden which they will enter, adorned therein with bracelets of gold and pearls, and their garments therein will be of silk. And they will say, “Praise be to Allah, who has taken away from us sorrow. Indeed, our Lord is Forgiving and Appreciative. Who has settled us in the home of permanence out of His bounty. No toil will touch us therein, nor will weariness touch us therein.”
35:36-38	And as for those who disbelieve, for them is the fire of Hell. They will not be finished off so that they may die, nor will their punishment be lightened. Thus do We recompense every disbeliever, while they cry therein, “Our Lord, take us out; we will do righteousness other than what we used to do. Did We not give you life long enough for whoever would remember to remember therein? And a warner has come to you, so taste [the punishment] - for there is no helper for the wrongdoers. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts.”
35:39-41	It is He who has made you successors upon the earth. So whoever disbelieves, upon him is his disbelief. And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers in the sight of their Lord except in hatred, and their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers except in loss. Say, Have you considered your associates whom you invoke besides God? Show me what they have created on the earth. Or do they have a share in the heavens, or have We given them a book so they are upon a clear proof thereof? Rather, the wrongdoers promise one another nothing but delusion. Indeed, God holds the heavens and the earth lest they cease to exist. And if they should cease, no one could hold them back after Him. Indeed, He is Forbearing and Forgiving.
35:42-45	And they swore by Allah with their most solemn oaths that if a warner came to them, they would surely be better guided than any of the nations. But when a warner came to them, it only increased them in aversion [in] arrogance upon the earth and evil plotting. But evil plotting does not encompass except its own people. Do they then await aught but the way of the former peoples? You will not find in the way of Allah any change, and you will not find in the way of Allah any alteration. Have they not traveled through the land and observed how was the end of those before them while they were greater than them in strength? And nothing in the heavens or on the earth could cause failure to Allah. Indeed, He is Knowing and Competent. And if Allah were to impose blame on men for what they have earned, He would not leave upon the surface of the earth a single creature, but He defers them for a specified term. And when their term has come - then indeed, Allah is ever, of His servants, Seeing.
36:1-12	Yasin. By the Qur’an, full of wisdom. Indeed, you are one of the messengers. On a straight path. A revelation from the Almighty, the Merciful. That you may warn a people whose fathers were not warned, so they are heedless. The word has already come into effect upon most of them, so they do not believe. Indeed, We have placed shackles on their necks, reaching to their chins, so their heads are raised. And We have placed before them a barrier and behind them a barrier and covered them so they do not see. And it is the same for them whether you warn them or do not warn them - they will not believe. You can only warn him who follows the message and fears the Most Merciful unseen. So give him good tidings of forgiveness and a generous reward. Indeed, it is We who bring the dead to life, and We record what they have put forth and what they left behind. And all things We have enumerated in a clear register.
36:13-19	"And present to them an example: the companions of the town, when there came to it the messengers. When We sent to them two, but they denied them, so We reinforced them with a third, and they said, ""Indeed, we are messengers to you."" They said, ""You are not but human beings like us, and the Most Merciful has not sent down anything. You are only lying."" They said, ""Our Lord knows that we are messengers to you. And our duty is only to convey [the message] clearly."" They said, ""Indeed, we regard you as an evil omen. If you do not desist, we will surely stone you, and a painful punishment will touch you from us."" They said, ""Your evil omen is with you. Is it that you are reminded? Rather, you are a transgressing people."""
36:20-27	"And there came from the farthest part of the city a man running. He said, ""O my people, follow the messengers. Follow those who do not ask of you any payment and who are [rightly] guided. And why should I not worship He who created me and to Him you will be returned? Should I take besides Him gods? If the Most Merciful should intend me harm, their intercession would not avail me at all, nor could they save me. Indeed, I would be in manifest error. Indeed, I have believed in your Lord, so listen."" It was said, ""Enter Paradise."" He said, ""I wish my people knew that my Lord has forgiven me and made me of the honored."""
36:28-32	And We did not send down upon his people after him any soldiers from the heaven, nor would We have sent them down. There was only one blast, and at once they were extinguished. Oh, woe to the servants! There does not come to them a messenger but they ridicule him. Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them? That to them they will not be returned. And that all, when they are all together, will be brought before Us.
36:33-47	"And a sign for them is the dead earth. We have given it life and produced from it grain, from which they eat. And We placed therein gardens of palm trees and grapevines, and caused springs to gush forth therein, that they may eat of its fruit and of that which their hands have made. Then will they not be grateful? Glory be to Him who created in pairs all things that the earth grows and from themselves and from that which they do not know. And a sign for them is the night. We strip from it the day, and suddenly they are in darkness. And the sun runs to a resting place for it. That is the determination of the Almighty, the Knowing. And the moon - We have determined for it phases until it returns [appearing] like an old dried date stalk. It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor does the night outstrip the day. Each, in an orbit, floats. And a sign for them is that We carried their offspring in the laden ship. And We created for them from the like thereof that on which they ride. And if We will, We can drown them, but there is no help for them, nor can they be saved. Except for mercy from Us and provision for a time. And when it is said to them, ""Fear what is before you and what is behind you that you may receive mercy,"" and not a sign comes to them from the signs of their Lord except that they turn away from it. And when it is said to them, ""Spend from what Allah has provided for you,"" those who disbelieve say to those who believe, ""Should we feed those whom Allah, if He willed, could feed?"" You are not but in manifest error."
36:48-54	"And they say, ""When will this promise come to pass, if you should be truthful?"" They await only a single blast that will seize them while they are disputing. Then they will not be able to make any recommendation, nor will they return to their families. And the Trumpet will be blown, and at once they will be hastening from the graves to their Lord. They will say, ""Woe to us! Who has raised us up from our beds? This is what the Most Merciful promised, and the messengers spoke the truth."" It will be only a single blast, and at once they will all be brought before Us. So this Day no soul will be wronged at all, and you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do."
36:55-58	Indeed, the companions of Paradise, that Day, will be in pleasure, occupied. They and their spouses will be in shade, reclining on adorned couches. For them therein will be fruit, and they will have whatever they request. Peace, a word from a Merciful Lord.
36:59-68	And distinguish yourselves today, O criminals. Did I not charge you, O children of Adam, that you not worship Satan - for indeed, he is to you a clear enemy - and that you worship Me - this is a straight path. And he has already led astray many of you. Then did you not use reason? This is Hell, which you were promised. Enter it today for what you used to disbelieve. Today We will set a seal upon their mouths, and their hands will speak to Us, and their feet will testify about what they used to earn. And if We willed, We could have obliterated their eyes, then they would race along the path, but how could they see? And if We willed, We could have transformed them in their places, so they would not be able to proceed nor return. And whom We grant life - We reverse in creation - so will they not use reason?
36:69-70	And We have not taught him poetry, nor is it befitting for him. It is not but a message and a clear Qur'an, that He may warn whoever is alive and that the word may come into effect against the disbelievers.
36:71-76	Have they not seen that We have created for them from what Our hands have made, livestock, so they own them? And We have subjected them to them, so some of them they ride and some of them they eat. And they have therein benefits and drinks. So will they not be grateful? And they have taken besides Allah deities that perhaps they will be aided. But they are not able to aid them, and they are for them an army prepared. So let not their statement grieve you. Indeed, We know what they conceal and what they declare.
36:77-83	"Has man not seen that We created him from a sperm-drop, then at once he is a clear adversary? And he presents to Us an example and forgets his own creation. He says, ""Who will give life to the bones when they have decayed?"" Say, ""He will give them life who produced them the first time. And He is Knowing of all creation."" He who made for you fire from the green tree, and at once you kindle from it. Is not He who created the heavens and the earth able to create the like of them? Yes, and He is the Creator, the Knowing. His command, when He intends a thing, is only to say to it, ""Be,"" and it is. So exalted is He in whose hand is the dominion over all things, and to Him you will be returned."
37:1-10	And those who rank up in ranks. And those who drive away with a drive. And those who recite the Reminder. Indeed, your God is One. Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them and Lord of the Easts. Indeed, We have adorned the lowest heaven with an adornment of stars. And as protection from every rebellious devil. They do not hear the assembly on high, and they are pelted from every side. Repelled, and for them is a lasting punishment. Except for him who snatches a snatch, then he is pursued by a piercing flame.
37:11-21	"So ask them, ""Are they stronger in creation, or those We created? Indeed, We created them from sticky clay."" Rather, I am amazed, and they mock. And when they are reminded, they do not remember. And when they see a sign, they ridicule. And they say, ""This is not but obvious magic. When we have died and become dust and bones, will we indeed be resurrected? Or our forefathers of old?"" Say, ""Yes,"" and you are in a state of contempt. But it will be only one shout, and at once they will look on. And they will say, ""Woe to us! This is the Day of Judgment! This is the Day of Separation which you used to deny."""
37:22-39	"Gather together those who did wrong, their spouses, and what they used to worship other than Allah, and guide them to the path of Hellfire. Stop them; indeed, they will be questioned. What is the matter with you that you do not help one another? Rather, today they are in submission. And they will turn to one another, questioning one another. They will say, ""Indeed, you used to come to us from the right."" They will say, ""Rather, you were not believers. And we had no authority over you. Rather, you were a transgressing people."" So the word of our Lord will come into effect upon us, ""Indeed, we will taste it."" So we led you astray; indeed, we were deviating. So indeed, that Day, they will be sharers in the punishment. Indeed, We will deal thus with the criminals. Indeed, when it was said to them, ""There is no god but Allah,"" they were arrogant. And they said, ""Should we indeed abandon our gods for the sake of a mad poet?"" Rather, he has brought the truth and confirmed the messengers. Indeed, you will taste the painful punishment. And you will not be recompensed except for what you used to do."
37:40-49	Except the chosen servants of Allah. For them is a known provision. Fruits, and they are honored. In gardens of pleasure. On thrones facing each other. A cup from a pure spring will be passed around to them. White, delicious to those who drink. Therein is no smell, nor will they intoxicate therefrom. And with them are maidens limiting their glances to [some], [but] one eye [with], as if they were eggs well-protected.
37:50-61	"Then some of them turned to others, questioning each other. One of them said, ""Indeed, I had a companion [who] says, 'Are you indeed among the believers? When we die and become dust and bones, shall we then be recompensed?'"" He said, ""Are you looking on?"" So he looked and saw him in the depths of Hellfire. He said, ""By God, you were almost sent back. And had it not been for the grace of my Lord, I would have been among those brought forth. So are we not to die? Except for our first death, and we are not to be punished.'"" Indeed, this is the great attainment. For such let the workers work."
37:62-74	Is that better as lodging or the tree of Zaqqum? Indeed, We have made it a trial for the wrongdoers. It is a tree emerging from the bottom of Hellfire. Its fruit is like the heads of devils. So they will eat from it and fill their bellies with it. Then they will have a mixture of scalding water for it. Then they will surely return to Hellfire. Indeed, they found their fathers astray, so they are in their footsteps hastening. And indeed, most of the former peoples had gone astray before them. And We had certainly sent among them warners. So see how was the end of the warners - Except for the chosen servants of Allah.
37:75-82	"And Noah called upon Us, and excellent is the respondent. And We saved him and his family from the great distress. And made his descendants the survivors. And We left for him among later generations. [""Peace be upon Noah among the worlds."" Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. He was of Our believing servants. Then We drowned the others."
37:83-98	And indeed, among his followers was Abraham, when he came to his Lord with a sound heart. When he said to his father and his people, “What do you worship? Do you seek gods other than Allah? Then what do you think of the Lord of the worlds?” So he looked at the stars and said, “Indeed, I am ill.” So they turned away from him, fleeing. He turned to their gods and said, “Why do you not eat? What is the matter with you that you do not speak?” He struck them with his right hand, and they came to him in droves. He said, “Do you worship that which you carve, while Allah created you and that which you do?” They said, “Construct for him a structure and cast him into the Fire.” So they intended against him a plan, but We made them the lowest.
37:99-113	"He said, ""Indeed, I am going to my Lord, and He will guide me. My Lord, grant me from among the righteous."" So We gave him good tidings of a forbearing boy. And when he reached with him the age of striving, he said, ""O my son, indeed I have seen in a dream that I am sacrificing you, so see what you think."" He said, ""O my father, do as you are commanded. You will find me, if Allah wills, among the steadfast."" So when they both submitted, he laid him upon his forehead. And We called to him, ""O Abraham, you have fulfilled the vision."" Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. Indeed, this was the clear trial. And We ransomed him with a great sacrifice. And We left for him among later generations, ""Peace be upon Abraham. Thus do We reward the doers of good. Indeed, he was of Our believing servants."" And We gave him good tidings of Isaac, a prophet among the righteous. And We blessed him and Isaac. And among their descendants are doers of good and wrongdoers to themselves clearly."
37:114-122	And We had certainly bestowed favor upon Moses and Aaron. And We saved them and their people from the great distress. And We gave them victory, and they were the predominant. And We gave them the clear Scripture. And We guided them to the straight path. And We left for them among later generations [a good deed]. Peace be upon Moses and Aaron. Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. Indeed, they were among Our believing servants.
37:123-132	And indeed, Elias was among the messengers. When he said to his people, “Will you not fear God?” “Do you call upon Baal and forsake the best of creators? Allah, your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of old.” But they denied him, so they will be brought forth. Except for the chosen servants of Allah. And We left for him among later generations, “Peace be upon the family of Yasin. Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good. Indeed, he was of Our believing servants.”
37:133-138	And indeed, Lot was among the messengers. When We saved him and his family, all together, Except an old woman among those who remained behind. Then We destroyed the others. And indeed, you pass by them in the morning and at night. Then will you not reason?
37:139-148	And indeed, Jonah was among the messengers. When he fled to the laden ship, he drew lots and was among the losers. Then the fish swallowed him, while he was blameworthy. And had he not been of those who glorify God, he would have remained inside its belly until the Day of Resurrection. Then We cast him upon the open shore while he was sick. And We caused a gourd vine to grow over him. And We sent him to a hundred thousand or more. So they believed, and We provided for them for a time.
37:149-157	So ask them, “Is it your Lord who has daughters and they have sons? Or did We create the angels female while they were witnesses?” Unquestionably, they are of their falsehood saying, “God has begotten a son,” and indeed, they are liars. He has chosen daughters over sons. What is the matter with you? How do you judge? Will you not be reminded? Or do you have a clear authority? Then produce your book, if you should be truthful.
37:158-166	And they have attributed a relationship between Him and Paradise, but Paradise has certainly known that they will be brought to account. Glory be to Allah above what they describe. Except for the sincere servants of Allah. Indeed, you and what you worship - you will not be tempted. Except for him who is destined for Hellfire. And there is not one of us but has a known station. And indeed, it is We who are the ones who line up [in ranks] and indeed, it is We who are the ones who glorify.
37:167-170	And they used to say, “If only we had a reminder from among the former peoples, we would have been sincere servants of Allah.” But they disbelieved in it, so they are going to know.
37:171-182	And Our word has already gone forth to Our servants, the messengers. Indeed, they will be the victorious. And indeed, Our soldiers will be the predominant. So turn away from them for a time and observe them - and they will see. Is it then that they seek to hasten Our punishment? But when it descends upon their courtyard - then evil will be the morning of those who were warned. So turn away from them for a time and observe - and they will see. Glory be to your Lord, the Lord of Might, above what they describe. And peace be upon the messengers. And praise be to God, Lord of the worlds.
38:1-11	"Sad. By the Qur'an full of remembrance. Rather, those who disbelieve are in arrogance and discord. How many generations before them have We destroyed? They cried out, but there was no time for escape. And they wondered that a warner had come to them from among themselves. And the disbelievers said, ""This is a magician, a liar. Has he made the gods one god? Indeed, this is a strange thing."" And the eminent ones among them departed, ""Walk and be patient with your gods. Indeed, this is something intended."" We have not heard of this in the later religion. This is not but an invention. Has the Reminder been sent down to him from among us? Rather, they are in doubt about My remembrance. Rather, they have not yet tasted the punishment. Or do they have the treasures of the mercy of your Lord, the Exalted in Might, the Bestower? Or do they have the dominion of the heavens and the earth and what is between them? So let them ascend through the means. The hosts there are defeated from the parties."
38:12-16	"Before them, the people of Noah and Aad and Pharaoh, the lord of the stakes, and Thamud and the people of Lot and the companions of the thicket denied. Those were the factions. Indeed, all denied the messengers, so the punishment is justified. And these await nothing except a single blast that will not cease. And they will say, ""Our Lord, hasten for us our portion before the Day of Reckoning."""
38:17-20	Be patient over what they say and remember Our servant David, the man of strength. Indeed, he was one who frequently turned back [to Allah]. Indeed, We subjected the mountains to him, to glorify Us in the evening and the morning, and the birds [also] gathered together, all returning to Him [in repentance]. And We strengthened his kingdom and gave him wisdom and decisive judgment.
38:21-26	"And has there reached you the story of the litigants when they climbed over the wall of the private chamber? When they entered upon David, and he was terrified by them. They said, ""Fear not. We are two adversaries, one of us has wronged the other, so judge between us in truth and do not be unfair, and guide us to the right path. Indeed, this is my brother. He has ninety-nine ewes, and I have one ewe. So he said, ""Entrust her to me,"" and he was harsh to me in the conversation. He said, ""He has certainly wronged you by asking for your ewe in addition to his ewes. And indeed, many associates oppress one another, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - and few are they."" And David thought that we had only tested him, so he asked forgiveness of his Lord and fell down in bowing and repented. So We forgave him that; and indeed, for him with Us is nearness to Him and a good place of return. O David, indeed We have made you a successor upon the earth, so judge between the people in truth and do not follow desire, as it will lead you astray from the way of Allah. Indeed, those who stray from the way of Allah will have a severe punishment because they forgot the Day of Account."
38:27-29	We did not create the heaven and the earth and all that is between them in vain. That is the assumption of those who disbelieve. So woe to those who disbelieve from the Fire. Shall We treat those who believe and do righteous deeds like corrupters on earth? Or shall We treat the righteous like the wicked? [This is] a blessed Book which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], that they may ponder its verses and that those of understanding may remember.
38:30-40	"And We gave to David Solomon, an excellent servant. Indeed, he frequently turned back [to God]. When in the evening the fine horses were presented to him. And he said, ""Indeed, I have preferred the love of good to the remembrance of my Lord until they are hidden behind the veil. Return them to me."" So he began to stroke their legs and necks. And We certainly tried Solomon and placed on his throne a body, but he repented. He said, ""My Lord, forgive me and grant me a kingdom such as will not belong to anyone after me. Indeed, You are the Bestower."" So We subjected to him the wind, blowing gently by his command wherever he directed. And the devils, every builder and diver, and others bound together in fetters. This is Our gift, so bestow or withhold without account. And indeed, for him with Us is nearness and a good place of return."
38:41-44	"And remember Our servant Job, when he called upon his Lord, ""Indeed, Satan has touched me with hardship and torment."" Stamp [the earth] with your foot; this is a spring of cool water to wash with and a drink. And We granted him his family and the like thereof with them as mercy from Us and a reminder for those of understanding. And take in your hand a bunch of grass and strike with it and do not break your oath. Indeed, We found him patient, an excellent servant. Indeed, he was one who frequently turned back [to God]."
38:45-48	And remember Our servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - possessors of strength and vision. Indeed, We purified them with a pure remembrance of the Home. And indeed, they are with Us among the chosen and best. And remember Ishmael, Elisha, Dhul-Kifl, and all of them were among the best.
38:49-54	This is a reminder, and indeed, for the righteous is an excellent place of return. Gardens of Eden, with doors open to them. Reclining therein, they will call therein for abundant fruit and drink. And with them will be maidens restraining their glances, of equal age. This is what you are promised for the Day of Reckoning. Indeed, this is Our provision, which will never be exhausted.
38:55-64	"This is indeed, for the transgressors is an evil place of return. Hell, they will burn therein, and wretched is the resting place. This one - let him taste it, scalding water and pus. And others like it - are in pairs. This is a group rushing in with you - no welcome for them. Indeed, they are going to the Fire. They will say, ""Rather, you are not welcome. You have brought this to us, so wretched is the resting place."" They will say, ""Our Lord, who brought this to us? Increase for him double the punishment in the Fire."" And they will say, ""What is the matter with us that we do not see men whom we used to count among the wicked? Have we taken them in ridicule, or has our eyes failed to see them?"" Indeed, that is the truth. The dispute of the people of the Fire is over."
38:65-88	"Say, ""I am only a warner, and there is no god except Allah, the One, the Prevailing. Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving."" Say, ""It is news of great importance. You turn away from it. I had no knowledge of the highest assembly when they disputed. It is not revealed to me except that I am a clear warner."" When your Lord said to the angels, ""Indeed, I am going to create a human being from clay. So when I have proportioned him and breathed into him of My [created] soul, then fall down to him in prostration."" So the angels prostrated, all of them together, except Iblis, who was arrogant and was among the disbelievers. He said, ""O Iblis, what prevented you from prostrating to that which I created with My hands? Were you arrogant, or were you among the exalted?"" He said, ""I am better than him. You created me from fire and created him from clay."" He said, ""Then get out of it, for indeed, you are expelled. And indeed, upon you is My curse until the Day of Judgment."" He said, ""My Lord, then respite me until the Day they are resurrected."" He said, ""Indeed, you are among those respite."" Until the Day of the appointed time. He said, ""Then by Your might, I will surely mislead them all. Except among them Your chosen servants."" He said, ""Then the truth, and I speak the truth."" I will surely fill Hell with you and those who follow you among them, all together. Say, ""I do not ask of you any reward for this, nor am I of the pretenders."" It is only a reminder to the worlds. And you will surely come to know its news after a while."
39:1-5	The Book is from Allah, the Almighty, the Wise. Indeed, We have sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book in truth, so worship Allah, devoting religion to Him sincerely. Unquestionably, pure religion belongs to Allah. And those who take protectors other than Him - we do not worship them except that they may bring us nearer to Allah. Indeed, Allah will judge between them concerning that over which they differ. Indeed, Allah does not guide one who is a liar and a disbeliever. Had Allah willed to take a son, He would have chosen from what He creates whatever He willed. Glory be to Him! He is Allah, the One, the Prevailing. He created the heavens and the earth in truth. He wraps the night over the day and wraps the day over the night. And He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running [its course] for a specified term. Indeed, He is the Almighty, the Forgiving.
39:6-8	"He created you from one soul, then made from it its mate, and sent down for you from the cattle eight mates. He creates you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, within three darknesses. That is Allah, your Lord; to Him belongs the kingdom. There is no god except Him, so how are you turned away? If you disbelieve - then indeed, Allah is free from need of you. And He does not approve of disbelief for His servants. And if you are grateful, He approves it for you. And no bearer of burdens will bear the burden of another. Then to your Lord is your return, and He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts. And when harm touches man, he calls upon his Lord, turning to Him in repentance; but when He bestows upon him a favor from Himself, he forgets what he used to call upon before and sets up rivals to Allah to mislead [people] from His way. Say, ""Enjoy your disbelief for a little; indeed, you are of the companions of the Fire."""
39:9-10	Or is he who is devoutly obedient during periods of the night, prostrating and standing [in prayer], fearing the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord? Say, “Are those who know equal to those who do not know?” Only those of understanding will remember. Say, “O My servants who have believed, fear your Lord. For those who do good in this world is good, and the earth of Allah is spacious. Only the patient will be given their reward in full, without account.”
39:11-20	"Say, ""Indeed, I have been commanded to worship Allah, devoting my religion to Him alone. And I have been commanded to be the first of the Muslims."" Say, ""Indeed, I fear, if I disobey my Lord, the punishment of a tremendous Day."" Say, ""Allah I worship, devoting my religion to Him alone."" So worship whatever you will besides Him. Say, ""Indeed, the losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, that is what is the manifest loss."" For them are canopies of Fire above them, and canopies below them. That is how Allah frightens His servants. ""O My servants, then fear Allah."" And those who avoid false gods, lest they worship them and turn to Allah in repentance - for them are good tidings. So give good tidings, My servants. Those who listen to the Word and follow the best of it - those are the ones whom Allah has guided, and those are the ones of understanding. Is it he against whom the word of punishment has come into effect? ​​Then can you save him who is in the Fire? But those who feared their Lord will have mansions, one above another, built [for him], beneath which rivers flow. The promise of Allah; Allah does not fail in His promise."
39:21-26	"Have you not seen that Allah sends down water from the sky, and causes it to flow as springs in the earth? Then He produces thereby crops of varying colors. Then they wither and you see them turn yellow; then He makes them debris. Indeed in that is a reminder for those of understanding. Is he whose breast Allah has expanded to Islam so that he is upon a light from his Lord? Then woe to those whose hearts are hardened against the remembrance of Allah? Those are in clear error. Allah has sent down the best statement, a consistent Book, repeated at which the skins of those who fear their Lord shiver. Then their skins and their hearts soften at the remembrance of Allah. That is the guidance of Allah by which He guides whom He wills. And he whom Allah leaves astray - for him there is no guide. Is he who will be protected against the evil of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection? And it will be said to the wrongdoers, ""Taste what you used to earn."" Those before them denied, so the punishment came to them from where they did not perceive. So Allah made them taste disgrace in the life of this world. And the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew."
39:27-31	And We have certainly presented for the people in this Qur'an from every [kind of] example that they may remember. An Arabic Qur'an without any crookedness that they may become righteous. Allah presents an example: a man with quarreling partners, and a man devoted to one man. Are they equal in comparison? Praise be to Allah! But most of them do not know. Indeed, you will die, and indeed, they will die. Then indeed, on the Day of Resurrection, you will dispute before your Lord.
39:32-37	Who then is more unjust than he who lies about Allah and denies the truth when it has come to him? Is there not in Hell an abode for the disbelievers? And he who brings the truth and believes in it - those are the righteous. They will have whatever they wish with their Lord. That is the reward of the doers of good - that Allah may remove from them the worst of what they did and reward them according to the best of what they used to do. Is not Allah sufficient for His servant? And they threaten you with those other than Him. And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no guide. And he whom Allah guides - for him there is no misguider. Is not Allah Exalted in Might and Owner of Retribution?
39:38-40	And if you ask them, “Who created the heavens and the earth?” they will surely say, “Allah.” Say, “Have you considered what you invoke besides Allah? If Allah intends me harm, can they remove His harm? Or if He intends me mercy, can they withhold His mercy?” Say, “Allah is sufficient for me; upon Him do the trusting rely.” Say, “O my people, work according to your position; indeed, I am working, and you will soon know.” Whoever is visited by a punishment that will disgrace him and upon whom will descend a lasting punishment.
39:41-41	Indeed, We have sent down to you, [O Muhammad], the Book for mankind in truth. So whoever is guided does so for [the benefit of] himself, and whoever goes astray only goes astray to his own detriment. And you are not a guardian over them.
39:42-44	"Allah takes the souls at the time of their death, and those that do not die during their sleep. Then He keeps those for which He has decreed death and sends the others back for a specified term. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought. Or have they taken intercessors other than Allah? Say, ""Even if they do not possess anything and do not reason?"" Say, ""To Allah belongs all intercession. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Then to Him you will be returned."""
39:45-48	And when Allah alone is mentioned, the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink from disgust; but when those other than Him are mentioned, at once they rejoice. Say, “O Allah, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, You judge between Your servants concerning that over which they used to differ.” And if those who did wrong had all that is in the earth and as much more with it, they would offer it as ransom themselves from the evil of the punishment on the Day of Resurrection. And there will appear to them from Allah that which they had never reckoned upon. And there will appear to them the evil of what they earned, and that which they used to ridicule will encompass them.
39:49-52	"So when harm touches man, he calls upon Us; then when We bestow upon him a favor from Us, he says, ""I have only been given it because of knowledge."" Rather, it is a trial, but most of them do not know. Those before them had already said so, but what they used to earn did not avail them. So the evil of what they earned afflicted them. And those who do wrong among these - the evil of what they earned will afflict them, and they will not cause failure. Do they not know that Allah extends provision to whom He wills and restricts it? Indeed in that are signs for a people who believe."
39:53-59	"Say, ""O My servants who have transgressed against themselves [by sinning], do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And turn [to Him] in repentance and submit to Him before the punishment comes upon you; then you will not be aided. And follow the best of what was revealed to you from your Lord before the punishment comes upon you suddenly while you perceive not. Lest a soul should say, ""Oh, how I wish I had been more mindful of my duty to Allah and had not been among the mockers."" Or say, when you see the punishment, ""If only I had another chance so I could be among the doers of good."" But yes, there did come to you My signs, but you denied them and were arrogant and were among the disbelievers."
39:60-67	"And on the Day of Resurrection you will see the faces of those who lied about Allah blackened. Is there not in Hell an abode for the arrogant? But Allah will save those who feared Him with their place of safety. No evil will touch them, nor will they grieve. Allah is the Creator of all things, and He is, over all things, Disposer of affairs. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. But those who disbelieve in the verses of Allah - it is they who are the losers. Say, ""Is it other than Allah that you order me to worship, O ignorant ones?"" And it has already been revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate [anything] with Allah, your work would surely become worthless, and you would surely be among the losers. Rather, worship Allah and be among the grateful. They have not appraised Allah with His true appraisal, while the earth entirely will be in His grip on the Day of Resurrection, and the heavens will be rolled up in His right hand. Glory be to Him and exalted be He above what they associate with Him."
39:68-70	And the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and all who are on the earth will fall unconscious except whom Allah wills. Then it will be blown again, and at once they will be standing, looking on. And the earth will shine with the light of its Lord, and the record will be placed, and the prophets and the witnesses will be brought, and it will be judged between them in truth, and they will not be wronged. And every soul will be fully compensated for what it did, and He is most knowing of what they do.
39:71-75	"And those who disbelieved will be driven to Hell in groups until, when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say to them, ""Did there not come to you messengers from among you reciting to you the verses of your Lord and warning you of the meeting of this Day of yours?"" They will say, ""Yes, but the word of punishment has come into effect upon the disbelievers."" It will be said, ""Enter the gates of Hell to abide eternally therein."" And evil is the residence of the arrogant. And those who feared their Lord will be driven to Paradise in groups until, when they reach it, its gates will be opened and its keepers will say to them, ""Peace be upon you. You have done well, so enter it to abide eternally."" And they will say, ""Praise be to Allah, who has fulfilled His promise to us and given us the earth as an inheritance. We may settle in Paradise wherever we will. How excellent is the reward of the workers."" And you will see the angels surrounding the Throne, exalting [Allah] with praise of their Lord, and it will be judged between them in truth. And it will be said, ""Praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds."""
40:1-4	Ha Mim. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Knowing. The Forgiver of sin, the Accepter of repentance, the Severe in penalty, the Lord of bounty. There is no deity except Him. To Him is the final destination. None disputes concerning the verses of Allah except those who disbelieve, so let not their moving about in the lands deceive you.
40:5-6	The people of Noah denied before them, and so did the parties after them. Every nation plotted against their Messenger to seize him, and they argued with falsehood to refute thereby the truth, but I seized them. Then how was My punishment? And thus the word of your Lord has come into effect upon those who disbelieved, that they are companions of the Fire.
40:7-9	Those who bear the Throne and those around it exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord and believe in Him and ask forgiveness for those who have believed, [saying], “Our Lord, You have encompassed all things in mercy and knowledge. So forgive those who have repented and followed Your way and protect them from the punishment of Hellfire. Our Lord, and admit them to the Gardens of Eden which You have promised them and to whoever was righteous among their fathers and their spouses and their descendants. Indeed, it is You who is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. And protect them from evil [deeds] and whoever You protect from evil [deeds] that Day - You have had mercy on him. And that is what is the great attainment.”
40:10-12	"Indeed, those who disbelieve will be called, ""The hatred of Allah is greater than your hatred of yourselves - when you were invited to faith and you disbelieved."" They will say, ""Our Lord, You caused us to die twice and gave us life twice, and we have acknowledged our sins. Is there any way out?"" That is because, when Allah alone is called upon, you disbelieve; but if partners are associated with Him, you believe. So the judgment belongs to Allah, the Most High, the Grand."
40:13-20	It is He who shows you His signs and sends down to you from the sky provision. And none remembers except he who turns [to Allah]. So call upon Allah, sincere to Him in religion, although the disbelievers hate it. [He is] Exalted in degrees, Owner of the Throne. He sends the spirit by His command upon whom He wills of His servants to warn of the Day of Meeting - the Day when they will be brought forth. Nothing of them will be hidden from Allah. To whom belongs the dominion today belongs to Allah, the One, the Prevailing. Today every soul will be recompensed for what it has earned. There will be no injustice today. Indeed, Allah is swift in account. And warn them of the approaching Day when the hearts will be at the throats, stifling. The wrongdoers will have neither a close friend nor an intercessor who will be obeyed. He knows the treachery of the eyes and what the breasts conceal. And Allah judges with truth, while those who invoke besides Him judge not at all. Indeed, Allah is the Hearing, the Seeing.
40:21-22	Have they not traveled through the land and observed what was the end of those before them? They were greater than them in strength and in traces upon the earth, so Allah seized them for their sins, and there was for them against Allah no protector. That was because there used to come to them messengers with clear proofs, but they disbelieved, so Allah seized them. Indeed, He is Powerful and Severe in penalty.
40:23-27	"And We had certainly sent Moses with Our signs and clear authority to Pharaoh, Haman, and Korah, but they said, ""A lying magician."" But when he brought them the truth from Us, they said, ""Kill the sons of those who believed with him and keep their women alive."" But the plot of the disbelievers is not but in error. And Pharaoh said, ""Leave me to kill Moses, and let him call upon his Lord. Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption to appear upon the earth."" And Moses said, ""Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Account."""
40:28-33	A believing man from the family of Pharaoh, who concealed his faith, said, “Will you kill a man because he says, ‘My Lord is Allah,’ while he has come to you with clear proofs from your Lord? And if he is a liar, upon him is his lie. But if he is truthful, some of what he promises you will befall you. Indeed, Allah guides not one who is a transgressor and a liar.” “O my people, yours is the kingdom this day, dominant upon the earth. But who will protect us from the punishment of Allah if it comes to us?” Pharaoh said, “I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the path of right conduct.” And he who believed said, “O my people, indeed I fear for you like the Day of the Confederates - like the conduct of the people of Noah, ‘Aad, and Thamud, and those after them. And Allah does not intend injustice for His servants. And O my people, indeed I fear for you the Day of Calling - the Day when you will turn back and depart. You will have from Allah no protector. And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no guide.”
40:34-35	"And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you did not cease to be in doubt about that which he brought you until, when he died, you said, ""God will never send after him a messenger."" Thus does God leave astray he who is a transgressor and full of doubts. Those who dispute concerning the verses of God without any authority having come to them - great is hatred in the sight of God and in the hearts of those who believe. Thus does God set a seal upon the heart of every arrogant, tyrannical person."
40:36-37	"And Pharaoh said, ""O Haman, build me a tower that I may reach the ways - the ways of the heavens - and look upon the God of Moses. And indeed, I think he is a liar."" And thus the evil of his deed was made attractive to Pharaoh, and he was averted from the way. And the plot of Pharaoh was only in ruin."
40:38-46	"And he who believed said, ""O my people, follow me; I will guide you to the path of right conduct."" O my people, indeed this worldly life is only an enjoyment, and indeed, the Hereafter - that is the home of permanence. Whoever does evil will not be recompensed except the like thereof. And whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - those will enter Paradise and will be provided for therein without account. And, O my people, why do I invite you to salvation and you invite me to the Fire? You invite me to disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, while I invite you to the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving. There is no doubt that what you invite me to has no call in this world or in the Hereafter. And our return is to Allah, and the transgressors are the companions of the Fire. So you will remember what I say to you. And I entrust my affair to Allah. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of His servants. So Allah protected him from the evil of their plotting, and the people of Pharaoh were encompassed by an evil punishment. The Fire they are exposed to morning and evening. And on the Day the Hour appears, [it will be said], ""Admit the people of Pharaoh into the severest punishment."""
40:47-52	"And when they dispute in the Fire, the weak will say to those who were arrogant, ""Indeed, we were your followers, so can you relieve us of a share of the Fire?"" Those who were arrogant will say, ""Indeed, we are all in it."" Indeed, Allah has judged between His servants. And those in the Fire will say to the keepers of Hell, ""Call upon your Lord to lighten for us a day of the punishment."" They will say, ""Did not your messengers come to you with clear proofs?"" They will say, ""Yes."" They will say, ""Then call upon Him."" But the call of the disbelievers is not but in error. Indeed, We will support Our messengers and those who believe during worldly life and on the Day when the witnesses will stand. The Day when no excuse will benefit the wrongdoers, and for them is the curse, and for them is the worst home."
40:53-58	And We had certainly given Moses the guidance and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit the Scripture - a guidance and a reminder for those of understanding. So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And ask forgiveness for your sin and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord in the evening and the morning. Indeed, those who dispute concerning the verses of Allah without any authority having come to them - there is in their hearts nothing but pride - they will never attain it. So seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Seeing. Indeed, the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind, but most people do not know. And not equal are the blind and the seeing. And those who believe and do righteous deeds and the evildoer. Little do you remember.
40:59-60	"The Hour is coming - there is no doubt about it - but most of the people do not believe. And your Lord says, ""Call upon Me; I will respond to you."" Indeed, those who disdain My worship will enter Hell [rendered] contemptible."
40:61-66	"It is Allah who has made for you the night that you may rest therein and the day to see. Indeed, Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but most people do not give thanks. That is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things. There is no god except Him, so how are you deluded? Thus are deluded those who used to deny the verses of Allah. It is Allah who made for you the earth a resting place and the sky a canopy and shaped you and perfected your forms and provided for you from the good things. That is Allah, your Lord, so blessed is Allah, Lord of the worlds. He is the Ever-Living; there is no god except Him, so call upon Him, devoting to Him religion sincerely. All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds. Say, ""Indeed, I have been forbidden to worship those you invoke besides Allah when the clear proofs have come to me from my Lord, and I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the worlds."""
40:67-68	It is He who created you from dust, then from a sperm-drop, then from a clinging clot, then brings you forth as a child, then [He causes you] to reach your full strength, then [then] to become old men. And among you is he who takes [a soul] before [his death], and [then] you [may] reach a specified term that you may understand. It is He who gives life and causes death. And when He decrees a matter, He only says to it, “Be,” and it is.
40:69-77	"Have you not seen those who dispute concerning the verses of Allah - how they are turned away? Those who deny the Book and that with which We sent Our messengers - they are going to know. When the shackles are around their necks and the chains, they are dragged. In scalding water, then into the Fire they are going to be burned. Then it will be said to them, ""Where are those you used to associate with Allah?"" They will say, ""They have gone astray from us. Rather, we did not call upon anything before."" Thus does Allah leave astray the disbelievers. That is because you used to exult upon the earth without right and because you used to be insolent. Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein. Wretched is the residence of the arrogant. So be patient. Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth. And either We show you some of what We promise them or We take you in death - to Us they will be returned."
40:78-78	And We had certainly sent messengers before you, among them were those about whom We have told you and among them were those about whom We have not told you. And it is not for a messenger to bring a sign except by permission of Allah. So when the command of Allah comes, the matter will be decided with truth, and there the falsifiers will lose.
40:79-85	"It is Allah who has made for you the grazing livestock that you may ride on some of them and eat from them - and for you therein are benefits and that you may attain through them a need in your hearts, and on them and in ships you are carried. And He shows you His signs - then which of the signs of Allah do you deny? Have they not traveled through the land and observed what was the end of those before them? They were more numerous than them and stronger in strength and in traces upon the land. But what they used to earn did not avail them. But when their messengers came to them with clear proofs, they rejoiced in what they had of knowledge, and that which they used to ridicule encompassed them. But when they saw Our punishment, they said, ""We believe in Allah alone and disbelieve in that which we used to associate with Him."" But their belief did not benefit them when they saw Our punishment. [This is] the way of Allah which has already occurred with His servants, and there the disbelievers lost out."
41:1-8	"Ha Mim. A revelation from the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. A Book whose verses are detailed - an Arabic Qur'an for a people who know - as a bringer of good tidings and a warner. But most of them turn away - so they do not hear. And they say, ""Our hearts are within coverings from that to which you invite us, and in our ears is deafness, and between us and you is a barrier, so work; indeed, we are working."" Say, ""I am only a human being like you, to whom it has been revealed that your god is one God, so be upright toward Him and ask His forgiveness."" And woe to those who associate others with God - who do not give zakah and who, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers. Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have a reward uninterrupted."
41:9-12	"Say, ""Do you indeed disbelieve in He who created the earth in two days and attribute to Him rivals? That is the Lord of the worlds."" And He placed therein firm mountains above it and blessed it and measured therein its sustenance in four days, equal for those who ask. Then He directed Himself to the heaven while it was smoke and said to it and to the earth, ""Come in, willingly or by compulsion."" They said, ""We come in obedience."" So He completed them as seven heavens in two days and inspired in each heaven its command. And We adorned the lowest heaven with lamps and as a preservation. That is the determination of the Almighty, the Knowing."
41:13-18	"But if they turn away, say, ""I have warned you of a thunderbolt like the thunderbolt of 'Aad and Thamud. When there came to them messengers from before them and behind them, ""Worship none but Allah,"" they said, ""If our Lord had willed, He could have sent down angels. But indeed, we, in that with which you have been sent, are disbelievers."" As for 'Aad, they were arrogant upon the earth without right and said, ""Who is stronger than us in strength?"" Did they not see that Allah, who created them, was stronger than them in strength? And they used to deny Our signs. So We sent upon them a furious wind during days of misfortune that We might make them taste the punishment of disgrace in the life of this world. And the punishment of the Hereafter is more disgraceful, and they will not be aided. As for Thamud, We guided them, but they preferred blindness to guidance, so the thunderbolt of disgraceful punishment seized them for what they were earning. And We saved those who believed and were fearing Allah."
41:19-24	"And on the Day when the enemies of Allah will be gathered to the Fire, they will be driven in ranks. Until, when they come to it, their hearing and their sight and their skins will testify against them as to what they used to do. And they will say to their skins, ""Why did you testify against us?"" They will say, ""He has made us speak - He who has made all things speak. And He created you the first time, and to Him you will be returned."" And you were not hiding yourself lest your hearing or your sight or your skins testify against you, but you assumed that Allah did not know much of what you do. And that assumption which you assumed about your Lord has ruined you, and you have become among the losers. So if they are patient, then the Fire will be their abode; but if they seek repentance, then they will not be among the repentant."
41:25-29	"And We assigned to them companions who made attractive to them what was before them and what was behind them. And the word came into effect upon them among nations that passed on before them of jinn and mankind. Indeed, they were losers. And those who disbelieved said, ""Do not listen to this Qur'an and speak noisily during it that you may overcome."" So We will surely make those who disbelieved taste a severe punishment, and We will surely recompense them for the worst of what they used to do. That is the recompense of the enemies of Allah - the Fire; for them therein is an eternal home as recompense for what they used to deny, Our verses. And those who disbelieved said, ""Our Lord, show us those who misled us among the jinn and mankind so that we may place them under our feet so that they will be among the lowest."""
41:30-32	Indeed, those who have said, “Our Lord is Allah,” and then remained on a right course - the angels will descend upon them, [saying], “Do not fear and do not grieve but receive good tidings of Paradise, which you were promised. We are your allies in worldly life and in the Hereafter. And you will have therein whatever your souls desire, and you will have therein whatever you request. An accommodation from a Forgiving, Merciful.
41:33-36	"And who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says, ""Indeed, I am of the Muslims."" Not equal are the good deed and the bad. Repel [evil] by that which is better, and thereupon he between whom and you there was enmity will become as though he was a devoted friend. And none is granted it except those who are patient, and none is granted it except one having great portion. But if an evil suggestion comes to you from Satan, then seek refuge in Allah. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing."
41:37-39	And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or to the moon, but prostrate to Allah, who created them, if it is Him that you worship. But if they are arrogant - then those who are with your Lord exalt Him night and day, and they do not become weary. And among His signs is that you see the earth still, but when We send down upon it rain, it quivers and swells. Indeed, He who gives life to it - He is the Giver of Life to the dead. Indeed, He is over all things competent.
41:40-44	"Indeed, those who dispute concerning Our verses are not hidden from Us. Is he who is thrown into the Fire better or he who comes secure on the Day of Resurrection? Do whatever you will. Indeed, He is Seeing of what you do. Indeed, those who disbelieve in the message when it comes to them - and indeed, it is a mighty Book. Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or from behind it - a revelation from One Full of Wisdom, Worthy of Praise. Nothing is said to you except what was said to the messengers before you. Indeed, your Lord is the Possessor of forgiveness and the Possessor of painful punishment. And if We had made it a foreign Qur'an, they would have said, ""Why are its verses not explained in detail? [Is it] a foreign [religion] and an Arabic [religion]?"" Say, ""It is, for those who believe, a guide and a healing."" But as for those who do not believe - in their ears is deafness, and it is, upon them, blindness. Those are being called from a distant place."
41:45-46	And We had certainly given Moses the Scripture, but they differed therein. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord, it would have been judged between them. And indeed, they are in disquieting doubt about it. Whoever does righteousness does so for [the benefit of] his own soul, and whoever does evil against it. And your Lord is not ever unjust to [His] servants.
41:47-48	"To Him is referred the knowledge of the Hour. No fruits emerge from their coverings, and no female conceives or gives birth except with His knowledge. And the Day He will call to them, ""Where are My partners?"" They will say, ""We have heard you, not one of us is a witness."" And that which they used to invoke before has vanished from them, and they think that there is for them no escape."
41:49-52	"Man never tires of praying for good, but if evil touches him, he becomes hopeless and despairing. And if We let him taste mercy from Us after an adversity has touched him, he will surely say, ""This is for me, and I do not think the Hour will occur."" And if I am returned to my Lord, I will surely have with Him the best. Then We will surely inform those who disbelieve of what they did, and We will surely make them taste a severe punishment. And when We bestow favor upon man, he turns away and distances himself. But if evil touches him, he is one of persistent supplication. Say, ""Have you considered: if it is from Allah and then you disbelieve in it, who is more astray than one who is in extreme dissent?"""
41:53-54	We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth. Is it not sufficient for your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness? Unquestionably, they are in doubt about the meeting with their Lord. Unquestionably, He is, over all things, encompassing.
42:1-6	Ha Mim. Ain Qaf. Thus does Allah inspire you and those before you - Allah is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great. The heavens almost burst from above them, while the angels exalt [Allah] with praise of their Lord and ask forgiveness for those on the earth. Unquestionably, it is Allah who is the Forgiving, the Merciful. And those who take protectors other than Him - Allah is a Guardian over them, and you are not a guardian over them.
42:7-12	And thus We have revealed to you an Arabic Qur'an that you may warn the Mother of Towns and those around it and warn of the Day of Assembly, about which there is no doubt. A party will be in Paradise and a party in the Blaze. And if Allah had willed, He would have made them one community, but He will admit whom He wills into His mercy. And the wrongdoers will have neither protector nor helper. Or have they taken allies besides Him? But Allah is the Protector, and He gives life to the dead, and He is over all things competent. And whatever you differ over, its judgment is with Allah. That is Allah, my Lord. In Him I have relied, and to Him I turn back. Creator of the heavens and the earth. He has made for you mates from among yourselves and mates from the livestock. He multiplies you thereby. There is nothing like Him, and He is the Hearing, the Seeing. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. He extends provision to whom He wills and restricts it. Indeed, He is Knowing of all things.
42:13-15	"He has ordained for you of religion what He enjoined upon Noah and that which We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], and what We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus - [saying], ""Establish the religion and do not be divided therein."" Difficult for the polytheists is that to which you invite them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills and guides to Himself whoever turns back [to Him]. And they did not become divided except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. And had it not been for a word that preceded from your Lord for a specified term, it would have been judged between them. And indeed, those who were inherited the Scripture after them are in disquieting doubt about it. Therefore, invite [to Allah] and be steadfast as you have been commanded and do not follow their inclinations and say, ""I have believed in what Allah has revealed of the Book, and I have been commanded to do justice between you. Allah is our Lord and your Lord. To us are our deeds, and to you are your deeds. There is no argument between us and you. Allah will gather us together, and to Him is the final destination."""
42:16-19	And those who dispute about Allah after He has been responded to - their argument is worthless with their Lord, and upon them is wrath, and for them is a severe punishment. Allah is He who has sent down the Book in truth and the balance. And what can make you know that perhaps the Hour is near? Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it, while those who believe are fearful of it and know that it is the truth. Unquestionably, those who dispute about the Hour are in extreme error. Allah is Kind to His servants. He provides for whom He wills. And He is the Strong, the Exalted in Might.
42:20-22	Whoever desires the harvest of the Hereafter - We increase for him his harvest. And whoever desires the harvest of this world - We give him thereof, but he has not in the Hereafter any share. Or have they partners who have instituted for them in religion that which Allah has not permitted? And were it not for the decisive word, the matter would have been judged between them. And indeed, for the wrongdoers is a painful punishment. You will see the wrongdoers fearful of that which they have earned and it will befall them. But those who have believed and done righteous deeds will be in the gardens of Paradise. They will have whatever they wish with their Lord. That is the great bounty.
42:23-26	"That is what Allah gives good tidings to His servants who have believed and done righteous deeds. Say, ""I do not ask of you any reward for it except love for the relatives. And whoever does good - We will increase for him good therein. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Appreciative."" Or do they say, ""He has invented a lie about Allah?"" Then if Allah wills, He will set a seal upon your heart. And Allah will blot out falsehood and establish the truth with His words. Indeed, He is Knowing of that within the breasts. And it is He who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons misdeeds and knows what you do. And He responds to those who believe and do righteous deeds and increases them from His bounty. But as for the disbelievers, they will have a severe punishment."
42:27-31	And if Allah were to expand the provision for His servants, they would surely rebel upon the earth, but He sends down in due measure what He wills. Indeed, He is, of His servants, Knowing and Seeing. And it is He who sends down the rain after they have despaired and spreads His mercy. And He is the Protector, the Praiseworthy. And among His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and what He has dispersed throughout them of creatures. And He is Able to gather them when He wills. And whatever strikes you of disaster - it is for what your hands have earned. And He pardons much. And you will not cause failure upon the earth, and you have not besides Allah any protector or helper.
42:32-36	And among His signs are ships upon the sea like mountains. If He wills, He can still the wind, and they remain motionless on its back. Indeed in that are signs for everyone patient and grateful. Or He may destroy them for what they have earned and pardon much. And He knows that those who dispute concerning Our verses have no escape. Whatever you have been given is but the enjoyment of worldly life. But what is with Allah is better and more lasting for those who have believed and upon their Lord rely.
42:37-43	And those who avoid major sins and immoralities, and when they become angry, they forgive. And those who have responded to their Lord and established prayer and whose affair is [determined by] consultation among themselves, and from what We have provided them, they spend. And those who, when injustice befalls them, defend themselves. And the recompense for an evil is an evil like it. But whoever pardons and makes reconciliation, his reward is [due] from Allah. Indeed, He does not like wrongdoers. And whoever defends himself after having been wronged - against those there is no blame. The blame is only against those who wrong the people and rebel in the land without right. Those will have a painful punishment. And as for whoever is patient and forgives - indeed, that is of the matters [requiring] determination.
42:44-46	"And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no protector after Him. And you will see the wrongdoers, when they see the punishment, saying, ""Is there any way back?"" And you will see them exposed to it, humbled by humiliation, looking from a hidden corner. And those who believed will say, ""Indeed, the losers are those who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection."" Unquestionably, the wrongdoers will be in an enduring punishment. And they will have no protectors to aid them other than Allah. And he whom Allah sends astray - for him there is no way."
42:47-50	Respond to your Lord before there comes from Allah a Day for which there is no repelling. That Day there will be for you no refuge, nor will there be for you any denunciation. But if they turn away, then We have not sent you over them as a guardian. Your duty is only to convey the message. And indeed, when We let man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it. But if evil befalls them for what their hands have put forth - then indeed, man is ungrateful. To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He gives to whom He wills female [children], and He gives to whom He wills males. Or He pairs them [with males and females] and He renders whom He wills barren. Indeed, He is Knowing and Competent.
42:51-53	It is not for a human being that Allah should speak to him except by revelation or from behind a veil or by sending a messenger to reveal by His permission what He wills. Indeed, He is Most High and Wise. And thus We have revealed to you, [O Muhammad], a spirit of Our command. You did not know what the Book was, nor what faith was, but We have made it a light by which We guide whom We will of Our servants. And indeed, you [are] guiding to a straight path - the path of Allah to whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Unquestionably, to Allah do all matters return.
43:1-8	Ha Mim. By the clear Book. Indeed, We have made it an Arabic Qur'an that you might understand. And indeed, it is in the Mother of the Book with Us, sublime and wise. Then shall We turn away from you the message because you are a transgressing people? And how many a prophet We sent among the former peoples! And there came not to them a prophet but they used to ridicule him. So We destroyed those stronger than them in force, and the example of the former peoples has passed.
43:9-14	"And if you ask them, ""Who created the heavens and the earth?"" they will surely say, ""He created them, the Exalted in Might, the Knowing."" He who made the earth a cradle for you and made for you therein paths that you may be guided. And He who sends down water from the sky in measured amounts, and We revive thereby a dead land. Thus will you be brought forth. And He who created all pairs and made for you ships and grazing livestock on which you ride, that you may mount on their backs and then remember the favor of your Lord when you are mounted thereon and say, ""Glory be to Him who has subjected this to us, and we could never have subdued it."" And indeed, to our Lord we will return."
43:15-25	And they have attributed to Him a portion of His servants. Indeed, man is clearly ungrateful. Or has He taken from what He creates daughters and preferred you with sons? And when one of them is given the news of that which is set forth for the Most Merciful as an example, his face darkens, and he is filled with inward grief. Or is one who is brought up in adornment while, in dispute, he is not clear? And they have made the angels, who are the servants of the Most Merciful, females. Did they witness their creation? Their testimony will be recorded, and they will be questioned. And they say, “If the Most Merciful had willed, we would not have worshipped them?” They have no knowledge of that. They are only guessing. Or have We given them a scripture before this so they cling to it? Rather, they say, “Indeed, we found our fathers following a religion, and indeed, we are, following in their footsteps.” And thus We did not send before you any warner to any city except that its affluent ones said, “Indeed, we found our fathers following a religion, and indeed, we are, following in their footsteps.” He said, “Even if I bring you better guidance than what you found your fathers following,” they said, “Indeed, we, in that with which you have been sent, are disbelievers.” So We took retribution from them; so see how was the end of the deniers.
43:26-28	"And when Abraham said to his father and his people, ""Indeed, I am disassociated from that which you worship. Except for He who created me, and indeed, He will guide me."" And He made it a word remaining among his descendants that perhaps they would return."
43:29-35	"Rather, We gave enjoyment to these and their fathers until there came to them the truth and a clear messenger. But when the truth came to them, they said, ""This is magic, and indeed, we disbelieve in it."" And they said, ""Why was this Qur'an not sent down to some great man from the two cities?"" Do they divide the mercy of your Lord? We have apportioned among them their livelihood in the life of this world and have raised some of them above others in degrees [of rank] so that they may take others for service. But the mercy of your Lord is better than what they accumulate. And had it not been that mankind would have become one community, We would have made for those who disbelieve in the Most Merciful roofs of silver for their houses and stairways upon which they ascend, and for their houses doors and couches upon which they recline, and adornments. And indeed, all that is but the enjoyment of worldly life, and the Hereafter, with your Lord, is for the righteous."
43:36-39	"And whoever turns away from the remembrance of the Most Merciful - We appoint for him a devil, and he is to him a companion. And indeed, they avert them from the way, while they think that they are guided. Until, when he comes to Us, he will say, ""Oh, would that between me and you were the distance of the two easts."" What an evil companion! And it will not benefit you this Day, since you have wronged, that you are in the punishment sharing."
43:40-45	Can you then make the deaf hear or guide the blind and he who is in manifest error? Then whether We take you away - indeed, We will take retribution from them - or We show you what We have promised them - indeed, We are over them competent. So hold fast to that which has been revealed to you. Indeed, you are on a straight path. And indeed, it is a reminder for you and your people, and you will be questioned. And ask those We sent before you of Our messengers: Did We ever appoint other than the Most Merciful deities to be worshipped?
43:46-56	"And We had certainly sent Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his chiefs. He said, ""Indeed, I am the Messenger of the Lord of the worlds."" But when he came to them with Our signs, at once they laughed at them. And We did not show them a sign except that it was greater than its predecessor. And We seized them with the punishment that perhaps they would return. And they said, ""O magician, call upon your Lord for us according to what He has promised you. Indeed, we are [rightly] guided."" But when We removed the punishment from them, at once they broke their promise. And Pharaoh called out among his people, saying, ""O my people, is not mine the kingdom of Egypt, and these rivers flowing beneath me? Then do you not see? Or am I better than this one who is despised and can hardly make himself clear?"" Why were bracelets of gold not cast upon him, or angels not brought with him in pairs? But he belittled his people, and they obeyed him. Indeed, they were a people wickedly. But when they angered Us, We took retribution from them and drowned them all. And We made them a precedent and an example for later generations."
43:57-66	And when the son of Mary was cited as an example, behold, your people turned away from him. And they said, “Are our gods better, or is he?” They only cite him to you out of argument. Rather, they are a quarrelsome people. He is only a servant upon whom We bestowed favor and made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if We willed, We could have made from you angels on the earth, succeeding [others]. And indeed, it is knowledge of the Hour, so have no doubt about it, and follow [them]. This is a straight path. And let not Satan avert you. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy. And when Jesus came with clear proofs, he said, “I have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ. So fear Allah and obey me. Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.” Then the factions differed among themselves. So woe to those who do wrong from the punishment of a painful Day. Do they await anything but the Hour, that it should come upon them suddenly while they do not perceive?
43:67-73	Friends that Day will be enemies to one another, except for the righteous. [It will be said], “O My servants, no fear will there be concerning you this Day, nor will you grieve - those who believed in Our verses and were Muslims [in submission to Allah]. Enter Paradise, you and your spouses, in rejoicing.” There will be served to them with trays of gold and goblets, and therein will be whatever the souls desire and the eyes delight in, and you will abide therein eternally. And that is the Paradise which you have been made to inherit for what you used to do. For you therein is much fruit from which you eat.
43:74-80	"Indeed, the criminals will abide eternally in the punishment of Hell. It will not cease for them, and they will therein remain in despair. And We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the wrongdoers. And they will cry, ""O Malik, let your Lord put an end to us."" He will say, ""Indeed, you will remain."" We have certainly brought you the truth, but most of you, to the truth, are averse. Or have they decided upon a matter? Then We will decide. Or do they think that We do not hear their secrets and their private conversations? Yes, and Our messengers are with them, writing down."
43:81-89	"Say, ""If the Most Gracious had a son, then I would be the first of his worshippers."" Glory be to the Lord of the heavens and the earth, the Lord of the Throne, above what they describe. So leave them to plunge and play until they meet their Day which they are promised. And He is God in the heaven and God on the earth, and He is the Wise, the Knowing. Blessed is He to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, and with Him is knowledge of the Hour, and to Him you will be returned. And those they invoke besides Him do not possess intercession, except for one who bears witness to the truth while they know. And if you ask them, ""Who created them?"" they will surely say, ""God."" So how are they deluded? And say, ""O my Lord! These are a people who do not believe."" So pardon them and say, ""Peace."" And they will soon know."
44:1-8	Ha Mim. By the clear Book. Indeed, We sent it down during a blessed night. Indeed, We were to warn. Therein is made distinct every matter of wisdom. [A] command from Us. Indeed, We were to send messengers. [A] mercy from your Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Hearing, the Knowing. Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them, if you should be [certain] [in certainty]. There is no deity except Him. He gives life and causes death - your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers of old.
44:9-16	"Rather, they are in doubt, playing. So await a Day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke, covering the people. This is a painful punishment. Our Lord, remove from us the punishment. Indeed, we are believers. How can they receive the reminder when there has come to them a clear Messenger? Then they turned away from him and said, ""A madman taught."" Indeed, We will remove the punishment for a little. Indeed, you will return. The Day We will strike with the greatest strike. Indeed, We will be the Avenger."
44:17-33	"And We had certainly tried before them the people of Pharaoh, and there had come to them a noble messenger, [saying], ""Come to me the servants of Allah. Indeed, I am to you a trustworthy messenger. And do not exalt yourselves against Allah. Indeed, I have come to you with clear authority. And I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord, lest you stone them. And if you do not believe me, then leave me."" Then he called upon his Lord, ""Indeed, these are a criminal people. So travel by night with My servants. Indeed, you will be pursued. And leave the sea in tranquility. Indeed, they are a drowned host."" How many gardens and springs have they left behind. And crops and noble positions. And comfort in which they used to enjoy themselves. Thus did We cause another people to inherit it. And the heaven and the earth did not weep for them, nor were they reprieved. And We had certainly saved the Children of Israel from the humiliating punishment from Pharaoh. Indeed, he was haughty, of the transgressors. And We had certainly chosen them with knowledge over the worlds. And We gave them of the signs that in which was clear trial."
44:34-39	"Indeed, these people say, ""It is only our first death, and we will not be resurrected."" So bring our fathers, if you should be truthful. Are they better or the people of Tubba' and those before them? We destroyed them. Indeed, they were criminals. And We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in play. We did not create them except in truth, but most of them do not know."
44:40-50	The Day of Judgment is their appointed time, all together. The Day when no protector will avail another protector at all, nor will they be aided - Except for him upon whom Allah has mercy. Indeed, it is He who is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful. Indeed, the tree of Zaqqum - food of the sinners - Like murky oil, boiling within bellies - Like the boiling of scalding water. Seize him and drag him into the midst of Hellfire. Then pour over his head some of the punishment of scalding water. Taste! Indeed, you are the Exalted in Might, the Generous. Indeed, this is what you were in doubt about.
44:51-59	Indeed, the righteous will be in a secure position. Among gardens and springs. They will wear fine silk and brocade, facing each other. Thus We will pair them with beautiful maidens with large, wide eyes. They will call therein for every fruit, secure. They will not taste death therein except the first death, and He will protect them from the punishment of Hellfire. [It is] a bounty from your Lord. That is what is the great attainment. We have only made it easy in your language that perhaps they will be reminded. So wait; indeed, they are waiting.
45:1-6	Ha Mim. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. Indeed, in the heavens and the earth are signs for the believers. And in your creation and what He disperses of moving creatures are signs for a people who are certain [in faith]. And the alternation of the night and the day and what Allah sends down from the sky of provision, giving life thereby to the earth after its lifelessness and the directing of the winds are signs for a people who reason. These are the signs of Allah which We recite to you in truth. So in what statement after Allah and His signs will they believe?
45:7-11	Woe to every slanderer and sinner. He hears the verses of Allah recited to him, then persists in arrogance as if he had not heard them. So give him tidings of a painful punishment. And when he learns something of Our verses, he takes them in ridicule. Those will have a humiliating punishment. Behind them is Hell, and what they have earned will not avail them at all, nor will what they have taken besides Allah as protectors. They will have a great punishment. This is guidance. But those who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord will have a punishment of painful punishment.
45:12-13	It is Allah who has subjected to you the sea that ships may sail therein by His command and that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful. And He has subjected to you whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth - all from Him. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought.
45:14-15	Tell those who believe to forgive those who do not expect the days of Allah, that He may recompense a people for what they used to earn. Whoever does righteousness does so for his own soul, and whoever does evil does so against it. Then to your Lord you will be returned.
45:16-20	And We had certainly given the Children of Israel the Scripture and wisdom and prophethood, and provided for them of the good things and preferred them over the worlds. And We gave them clear proofs of the matter, but they did not differ except after knowledge had come to them - out of jealous animosity between themselves. Indeed, your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that over which they used to differ. Then We put you on a way of religion, so follow it and do not follow the inclinations of those who do not know. They will never avail you against Allah at all. And indeed, the wrongdoers are allies of one another. And Allah is the ally of the righteous. These are insights for the people and guidance and mercy for a people who are certain [in faith].
45:21-22	Or do those who commit evil deeds think that We will make them like those who believe and do righteous deeds - equal in their life and their death? Evil is that which they judge. And God created the heavens and the earth in truth so that every soul may be recompensed for what it has earned, and they will not be wronged.
45:23-26	"Have you seen he who has taken as his god his own desire and Allah has sent him astray due to knowledge and has set a seal upon his hearing and his heart and put over his vision a veil? Then who will guide him after Allah? Then will you not be reminded? And they say, ""There is not but our worldly life. We die and we live, and nothing destroys us except time."" And they have no knowledge of that. They are only guessing. And when Our clear verses are recited to them, their only argument is that they say, ""Bring our fathers, if you should be truthful."" Say, ""Allah gives you life, then causes you to die, then He will assemble you for the Day of Resurrection, about which there is no doubt."" But most of the people do not know."
45:27-35	"To Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And on the Day the Hour will appear, that Day the falsifiers will lose. And you will see every nation kneeling. Every nation will be called to its book. Today you will be recompensed for what you used to do. This is Our book that speaks against you with truth. Indeed, We were recording what you used to do. But as for those who believed and did righteous deeds, their Lord will admit them to His mercy. That is what is the clear attainment. But as for those who disbelieved, ""Were not My verses recited to you, and you were arrogant and were a criminal people?"" And when it is said, ""Indeed, the promise of Allah is truth and the Hour is about which there is no doubt,"" you say, ""We do not know what the Hour is. We only assume an assumption, and we are not certain."" And the evils of what they did will appear to them, and that which they used to ridicule will encompass them. And it will be said, ""Today We will forget you as you forgot the meeting of this Day of yours. And your refuge will be the Fire, and you will have no helpers."" That is because you took the verses of Allah in ridicule and the worldly life deceived you. So today they will not emerge from it, nor will they be asked to repent."
45:36-37	Praise be to God, Lord of the heavens and Lord of the earth, Lord of the worlds. To Him belongs majesty in the heavens and the earth. He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
46:1-5	Ha Mim. The revelation of the Book is from Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. We did not create the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except in truth and for a specified term. And those who disbelieve, from that which they are warned, turn away. Say, Have you considered that which you invoke besides Allah? Show me what they have created of the earth, or do they have a share in the heavens? Bring me a book before this or a trace of knowledge, if you should be truthful. And who is more astray than he who invokes besides Allah those who will not respond to him until the Day of Resurrection, and they, of their invocation, are unaware.
46:6-8	"And when mankind is gathered together, they will be their enemies and will be disbelievers in their worship. And when Our verses are recited to them as clear proofs, those who disbelieve say of the truth when it has come to them, ""This is obvious magic."" Or do they say, ""He has invented it?"" Say, ""If I have invented it, then you will not possess for me anything against Allah. He is most knowing of what you conceal. Sufficient is He as a witness between me and you. And He is the Forgiving, the Merciful."""
46:9-14	"Say, ""I am not an innovation among the messengers, and I do not know what will be done with me or with you. I only follow what is revealed to me. And I am not but a clear warner."" Say, ""Have you considered: if it is from Allah and you disbelieve in it and a witness from among the Children of Israel testifies to the like of it and believes, but you are arrogant? Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people."" And those who disbelieve say to those who believe, ""If it had been good, they would not have preceded us to it."" And since they are not guided by it, they will say, ""This is an ancient falsehood."" And before it was the Scripture of Moses as a guide and a mercy. And this is a confirming Scripture in the Arabic tongue to warn those who do wrong and as good tidings to the doers of good. Indeed, those who say, ""Our Lord is Allah"" and then remain on a right course - no fear will there be concerning them, nor will they grieve. Those are the companions of Paradise, abiding therein as recompense for what they used to do."
46:15-18	"And We have enjoined upon man, to his parents, good treatment. His mother carried him with hardship and gave birth to him with hardship. And his gestation and weaning [period] is thirty months until, when he reaches maturity and reaches forty years, he says, ""My Lord, enable me to be grateful for Your favor which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents and to do righteousness of which You approve. And make righteous for me my offspring. Indeed, I have repented to You, and indeed, I am of the Muslims."" Those are the ones from whom We will accept the best of what they did and overlook their misdeeds. They will be among the companions of Paradise - the promise of truth which they were promised. And he who said to his parents, ""Fie upon you! Do you promise me that I will be brought forth while generations before me have passed away?"" And they both cry for help to God. Woe to you! Believe! Indeed, the promise of God is truth. He says, ""This is not but legends of the former peoples."" Those are the ones upon whom the Word has come into effect among nations that have passed on before them of jinn and mankind. Indeed, they were losers."
46:19-20	And for all are degrees according to what they have done, and that He may fully recompense them for their deeds, and they will not be wronged. And the Day those who disbelieved will be exposed to the Fire, [it will be said], “You consumed your good things in your worldly life and enjoyed them, so today you will be recompensed with the punishment of humiliation for being arrogant upon the earth without right and for being defiantly disobedient.”
46:21-25	"And mention the brother of Aad, when he warned his people in Al-Ahqaf, although warners had passed before him and behind him, ""Worship none but Allah. Indeed, I fear for you the punishment of a tremendous Day."" They said, ""Have you come to us to turn us away from our gods? Then bring to us what you threaten us, if you should be of the truthful."" He said, ""Knowledge is only with Allah, and I have conveyed to you that with which I have been sent, but I see that you are a people behaving ignorantly."" But when they saw it as a cloud approaching their valleys, they said, ""This is a cloud bringing us rain. Rather, it is that which you were impatient for - a wind within which is a painful punishment."" It destroys everything by the command of its Lord. So in the morning nothing could be seen except their dwellings. Thus do We recompense the criminal people."
46:26-28	And We had certainly established them in that in which We had not established you, and We gave them hearing and sight and hearts. But their hearing, sight, and hearts availed them not at all, when they denied the signs of Allah, and that which they used to ridicule encompassed them. And We had certainly destroyed the towns around you and diversified the signs that perhaps they would return. So why did not those whom they took as deities besides Allah aid them? Rather, they have gone astray from them. That is their falsehood and that which they used to invent.
46:29-32	"And [mention] when We directed to you a company of the jinn, listening to the Qur'an. And when they attended it, they said, ""Listen quietly."" And when it was concluded, they turned back to their people as warners. They said, ""O our people, indeed we have heard a Book revealed after Moses, confirming what was before it, guiding to the truth and to a straight path. O our people, respond to the Caller of Allah and believe in him. He will forgive you some of your sins and protect you from a painful punishment. And whoever does not respond to the Caller of Allah - he will not escape [Allah's] on earth, and he will have no protectors besides Him. Those are in manifest error."
46:33-35	"Have they not seen that God - He who created the heavens and the earth and was not weary in their creation - is able to give life to the dead? Yes, He is over all things competent. And the Day those who disbelieved will be exposed to the Fire - is this not the truth? They will say, ""Yes, by our Lord."" He will say, ""Then taste the punishment for what you used to disbelieve."" So be patient, as were patient the messengers of strong will, and do not be impatient over them - as if, on the Day they see that which they are promised, they had not remained [in the world] except for an hour of a day. [Proclaim], So are there any who are destroyed except the defiantly disobedient people?"
47:1-6	"Those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of Allah - He will render worthless their deeds. But those who believe and do righteous deeds and believe in what was revealed to Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He will remove from them their misdeeds and amend their condition. That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood, and those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus Allah presents for the people their examples. So when you meet those who disbelieve, smite [their] necks until, when you have inflicted slaughter upon them, then secure [their] bonds. Then either [take] a favor afterwards or ransom [them] until the war lays down its burdens. That is so. And had Allah willed, He could have taken vengeance upon them, but [He intends] to test some of you by means of others. And [He says], ""As for those who are killed in the way of Allah - never will He render worthless their deeds."" He will guide them and amend their condition. And He will admit them to Paradise, which He has made known to them."
47:7-11	O you who have believed, if you support Allah, He will support you and plant firmly your feet. But as for those who disbelieve - for them is ruin, and He renders worthless their deeds. That is because they hated what Allah revealed, so He rendered worthless their deeds. Have they not traveled through the land and observed what was the end of those before them? Allah destroyed them and there is the like of it for the disbelievers. That is because Allah is the Protector of those who believe, and because the disbelievers have no protector.
47:12-15	Indeed, Allah will admit those who believe and do righteous deeds to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But those who disbelieve will enjoy themselves and eat as cattle eat, and the Fire will be their abode. And how many a city was stronger than your city which expelled you? We destroyed them, so there was none to help them. Is one who has a clear proof from his Lord like one to whom the evil of his deeds has been made pleasing and who follows his own desires? The description of Paradise, which the righteous have been promised: in it are rivers of water unaltered, rivers of milk the taste of which never changes, rivers of wine delicious to those who drink, and rivers of purified honey. And for them therein are all kinds of fruits and forgiveness from their Lord. It is like one who abides eternally in the Fire and is given to drink scalding water, which cuts through their intestines.
47:16-19	"And among them are those who listen to you until, when they go out from you, they say to those who were given knowledge, ""What did he say just now?"" Those are the ones whose hearts Allah has sealed, and they follow their desires. And those who are guided - He increases them in guidance and gives them their righteousness. Do they await anything but the Hour that it should come upon them suddenly? But its signs have already come. So how will they be, when their reminder has come to them? So know that there is no god except Allah. And ask forgiveness for your sin and for the believing men and believing women. And Allah knows your [every] movement and your resting place."
47:20-24	"And those who believe say, ""Why was a surah not sent down?"" But when a surah is sent down with decisive detail and fighting is mentioned therein, you see those in whose hearts is disease looking at you with a look of one fainting from death. So it is more appropriate for them to obey and speak equitably. But when the matter is decided, if they were true to Allah, it would be better for them. Then would you then, if you were given authority, cause corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship? Those are the ones Allah has cursed, making them deaf and blinding their vision. Do they not then reflect upon the Qur'an, or are there locks upon their hearts?"
47:25-29	"Indeed, those who turned back after guidance had become clear to them - Satan enticed them and prolonged hope for them. That is because they said to those who hated what Allah revealed, ""We will obey you in some of the matter."" And Allah knows their secrets. So how will it be when the angels take their souls while they strike their faces and their backs? That is because they followed that which angered Allah and hated His approval, so He rendered worthless their deeds. Or do those in whose hearts is disease think that Allah will not bring to light their hatred?"
47:30-32	And if We willed, We could have shown them to you, and you would have known them by their mark, and you will surely know them by the tone of their speech. And Allah knows your deeds. And We will surely test you until We make evident those who strive among you [for the cause of Allah] and the steadfast, and We will make evident [your] news. Indeed, those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of Allah and oppose the Messenger after guidance has become clear to them - never will they harm Allah at all, and He will render worthless their deeds.
47:33-38	O you who have believed, obey Allah and obey the Messenger and do not invalidate your deeds. Indeed, those who disbelieve and avert [people] from the way of Allah and then die while they are disbelievers - never will Allah forgive them. So do not weaken and call for peace while you are superior. And Allah is with you and will never deprive you of your deeds. The life of this world is only play and amusement. And if you believe and fear Allah, He will give you your rewards and will not ask you for your wealth. If they ask you for it, He will withhold from you, and He will bring forth your grudges. Here you are, you are called upon to spend in the cause of Allah. But among you is he who is niggardly. And whoever is niggardly is niggardly only from himself. And Allah is the Free of need, while you are the poor. And if you turn away, He will replace you with another people; then they will not be the likes of you.
48:1-4	Indeed, We have granted you a clear conquest. That Allah may forgive you your past and future sins and complete His favor upon you and guide you to a straight path. And that Allah may support you with a mighty victory. It is He who has sent down tranquility into the hearts of the believers that they may increase in faith along with their [present] faith. And to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth. And ever is Allah Knowing and Wise.
48:5-7	That He may admit the believing men and believing women to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally, and He will remove from them their misdeeds. And that is, in the sight of Allah, a great attainment. And He will punish the hypocrites, men and hypocrites, and the polytheists, men and women, who think ill of Allah. Upon them is a cycle of evil, and the wrath and the curse of Allah are upon them and He has prepared for them Hell, and evil it is as a destination. And to Allah belong the soldiers of the heavens and the earth, and ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise.
48:8-9	Indeed, We have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger and support him and honor him and glorify Him morning and evening.
48:10-13	"Indeed, those who pledge allegiance to you, [O Muhammad], are only pledging allegiance to Allah. The Hand of Allah is over their hands. So whoever breaks his pledge, he only breaks it to the detriment of his own soul. And whoever fulfills what he has pledged to Allah - He will give him a great reward. Those of the desert Arabs who stayed behind will say to you, ""Our wealth and our families have occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us."" They say with their tongues what is not in their hearts. Say, ""Who can control for you anything against Allah if He intends for you harm or intends for you benefit?"" Rather, ever is Allah, with what you do, Acquainted. But you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families, and that was made attractive to your hearts, and you assumed an evil assumption, and you were a people perishing. And whoever does not believe in Allah and His Messenger - then indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers a Blaze."
48:14-15	To God belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills. And ever is God Forgiving and Merciful. Those who stayed behind will say, “When you set out to take spoils, let us follow you.” They want to alter the words of God. Say, “You will not follow us.” Thus said God before. They will say, “Rather, you envy us.” Rather, they did not understand except a little.
48:16-17	"Say to the desert Arabs who stayed behind, ""You will be called to fight a people of great strength. You will fight them or they will submit. If you obey, Allah will give you a good reward. But if you turn away as you turned away before, He will punish you with a painful punishment. There is no blame upon the blind or upon the lame or upon the ill. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger - He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow. But whoever turns away - He will punish him with a painful punishment."""
48:18-23	Allah was pleased with the believers when they swore allegiance to you under the tree. He knew what was in their hearts, so He sent down tranquillity upon them and rewarded them with an imminent conquest and abundant spoils which they would take. And ever is Allah Exalted in Might and Wise. Allah promised you abundant spoils which you would take, so He hastened these for you and restrained the hands of the people from you and that it might be a sign for the believers and guide you to a straight path. And other things which you were not able to attain - Allah has encompassed them. And ever is Allah over all things competent. And if those who disbelieve fight you, they will surely turn their backs; then they will not find any protector or helper. This is the way of Allah which has already occurred before, and you will not find any change in the way of Allah.
48:24-26	And it is He who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had given you victory over them. And ever is Allah, of what you do, Seeing. They are the ones who disbelieved and hindered you from the Sacred Mosque and the offering was held back from reaching its destination. And had it not been for believing men and believing women whom you did not know, lest you trample them and there should befall you on their part a disgrace without knowledge - that Allah might admit into His mercy whom He willed. Had they separated themselves, We would have punished those who disbelieved among them with a painful punishment. When those who disbelieved put into their hearts arrogance - the arrogance of ignorance - then Allah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger and upon the believers and made the word of piety binding upon them, and they were more deserving of it and worthy of it. And ever is Allah Knowing of all things.
48:27-29	Allah has fulfilled the vision of His Messenger with the truth: “You will surely enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, in safety, with your heads shaved or your hair cut short, having no fear.” He knew that which you did not know, and He has ordained, other than that, a near conquest. It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion. And sufficient is Allah as Witness. Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. And those with him are forceful against the disbelievers, merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and prostrating, seeking bounty from Allah and approval. Their mark is on their faces from the trace of prostration. That is their description in the Torah, and their description in the Gospel is like a seed that sends forth its shoot, then strengthens it, so it becomes thick and stands firmly on its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers through them. Allah has promised those who believe and do righteous deeds among them forgiveness and a great reward.
49:1-5	O you who have believed, do not put yourselves before Allah and His Messenger, and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Knowing. O you who have believed, do not raise your voices above the voice of the Prophet or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others, lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not. Indeed, those who lower their voices in the presence of the Messenger of Allah - those are the ones whose hearts Allah has tested for righteousness. For them is forgiveness and a great reward. Indeed, those who call to you from behind the chambers, most of them do not reason. And if they had been patient until you came out to them, it would have been better for them. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.
49:6-8	O you who have believed, if there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful. And know that among you is the Messenger of Allah. If he were to obey you in much of the matter, you would be cursed. But Allah has endeared faith to you and has made it pleasing in your hearts and has made hateful to you disbelief, disobedience, and rebellion. Those are the [rightly] guided. [It is] bounty from Allah and favor. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.
49:9-10	And if two parties among the believers should fight, then make peace between them. But if one of them oppresses the other, then fight against the one that oppresses until it returns to the command of Allah. And if it returns, then make peace between them with justice and act equitably. Indeed, Allah loves those who act equitably. The believers are but brothers, so make peace between your two brothers. And fear Allah that you may receive mercy.
49:11-13	O you who have believed, let not a people ridicule [another] people; perhaps they may be better than them; nor let women ridicule [other] women; perhaps they may be better than them. And do not insult one another and do not call one another by [offensive] nicknames. Evil is the name of disobedience after faith. And whoever does not repent - then those are the wrongdoers. O you who have believed, avoid much [negative] assumption. Indeed, some assumptions are sin. And do not spy or backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his brother dead? You would detest it. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted.
49:14-18	"The Bedouins say, ""We have believed."" Say, ""You have not believed; but say, 'We have submitted,' for faith has not yet entered your hearts. And if you obey Allah and His Messenger, He will not deprive you of anything of your deeds. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful."" The believers are only those who have believed in Allah and His Messenger and then doubted not and striven with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah - those are the truthful. Say, ""Do you teach Allah about your religion?"" And Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Allah is Knowing of all things. They do you a favor by [referring to] you [in Islam]. Say, ""Do not do me a favor by your submission. Rather, Allah does you a favor by guiding you to the faith, if you should be truthful. Indeed, Allah knows the unseen [aspects] of the heavens and the earth. And Allah is Seeing of what you do."""
50:1-11	Qaf. By the Glorious Qur’an. Rather, they wonder that there has come to them a warner from among themselves. So the disbelievers say, “This is an amazing thing. Is it when we die and become dust that is an impossible return?” Indeed, We know what the earth takes of them, and with Us is a record that preserves. Rather, they denied the truth when it came to them, so they are in a confused state. Have they not looked at the sky above them - how We constructed it and adorned it, and there are no rifts in it? And the earth - We have spread it out and cast therein firm mountains and caused to grow therein [something] of every beautiful kind - as insight and a reminder for every servant who turns [to Allah]. And We sent down from the sky blessed water, and We caused to grow thereby gardens and grain for harvest and tall palm trees with clustered dates - as provision for the servants. And We revive thereby a dead land. Thus is the emergence.
50:12-15	Before them, the people of Noah, the companions of Ar-Rass, and Thamud denied, as did Aad, Pharaoh, the brothers of Lot, the companions of the thicket, and the people of Tubba. All denied the messengers, so My threat came true. Have We become weary with the first creation? Rather, they are in doubt about a new creation.
50:16-19	And We have certainly created man, and We know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than his jugular vein. When the two receivers receive, seated on the right and on the left, not a word does he utter but there is by him an observer ready to record it. And the stupor of death will come in truth. That is what you were avoiding.
50:20-35	And the Trumpet will be blown, that is the Day of Threat. And every soul will come with it a driver and a witness, [saying], “Indeed, you were in heedlessness of this, so We have removed from you your covering, and your sight today is sharp.” And his companion will say, “This is what I have prepared.” Throw into Hell every obstinate disbeliever, a hinderer of good, an aggressor, a doubter, who has set up with Allah another god - so throw him into the severe punishment. His companion will say, “Our Lord, I did not make him transgress, but he was in error far astray.” He will say, “Do not dispute in My presence, while I have already presented to you the threat. The word in My presence will not be changed, and I am not unjust to the servants.” The Day We will say to Hell, “Are you filled?” and it will say, “Are there any more?” And Paradise will be brought near to the righteous, not far away. This is what you were promised - for everyone who frequently turns back [to Allah] and is mindful - who fears the Most Merciful unseen and comes with a heart turning [to Allah]. Enter it in peace. That is the Day of Eternity. They will have whatever they wish therein, and with Us is more.”
50:36-45	And how many a generation before them have We destroyed who were mightier than they in strength. So they searched through the lands. Is there any escape? Indeed in that is a reminder for whoever has a heart or listens while he is a witness. And We had certainly created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days, and no fatigue touched Us. So be patient over what they say and exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord before the rising of the sun and before its setting. And during parts of the night exalt Him and at the ends of prostration. And listen on the Day when the crier will call from a place nearby. The Day they will hear the Shout in truth. That is the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, it is We who give life and cause death, and to Us is the final destination. The Day the earth will split open from them in haste. That is an easy gathering for Us. We are most knowing of what they say, and you are not a competitor over them. So remind with the Qur’an whoever fears My threat.
51:1-6	And the winds that scatter. And the winds that carry heavy loads. And the winds that run smoothly. And the winds that divide a matter. What you are promised is true. And indeed, the Recompense is coming to pass.
51:7-14	"By the heaven of interwoven fabrics. Indeed, you are in a different statement. He who slanders it turns away. The liars are destroyed. They are those who are in the midst of heedlessness. They ask, ""When is the Day of Judgment?"" The Day they will be tested over the Fire. ""Taste your trial. This is what you were hastening for."""
51:15-23	Indeed, the righteous will be among gardens and springs, accepting what their Lord has given them. Indeed, they were before that doers of good. They used to sleep but little of the night, and in the hours before dawn they would ask forgiveness. And in their wealth is a right for the needy and the deprived. And on the earth are signs for the certain [in faith]. And in yourselves - then will you not see? And in the heaven is your provision and that which you are promised. So by the Lord of the heaven and the earth, it is the truth, just as you speak.
51:24-37	"Has there reached you the story of the honored guests of Abraham? When they entered upon him and said, ""Peace."" He said, ""Peace be upon you, people unknown."" He went to his family and brought a fattened calf and brought it near to them. He said, ""Will you not eat?"" But he felt fear of them. They said, ""Do not fear, and give him good tidings of a learned boy."" Then his wife came in a shriek and struck her face and said, ""A barren old woman."" They said, ""Thus says your Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Wise, the Knowing."" He said, ""Then what is your business, O messengers?"" They said, ""Indeed, we have been sent to a people of criminals to send upon them stones of clay, marked from your Lord for the transgressors."" So We brought out whoever was therein of the believers. But We found therein not but one house of Muslims. And We left therein a sign for those who fear the painful punishment."
51:38-46	And in Moses, when We sent him to Pharaoh with clear authority. But he turned away with his support and said, “A magician or a madman.” So We seized him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea, and he was blameworthy. And in Aad, when We sent upon them the barren wind. It did not leave anything it came upon except that it made it like chaff. And in Thamud, when it was said to them, “Enjoy yourselves for a time.” But they rebelled against the command of their Lord, so the thunderbolt seized them while they were looking on. So they were not able to stand, nor were they able to defend themselves. And [referring to] the people of Noah before. Indeed, they were a people of wickedness.
51:47-51	And the heaven We constructed with power, and indeed, We are expanding it. And the earth We spread out, and excellent are the spreaders. And of everything We created pairs that you may remember. So flee to Allah. Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear warner. And do not make with Allah another deity. Indeed, I am to you from Him a clear warner.
51:52-60	"Likewise, there came not to those before them a messenger but they said, ""A magician or a madman."" They enjoin one another to do so. Rather, they are a transgressing people. So turn away from them, for you are not to be blamed. And remind, for the reminder benefits the believers. And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not want from them any provision, nor do I want them to feed Me. Indeed, it is Allah who is the Provider, the Lord of strength, the Sturdy. So indeed, those who do wrong will have sins like the sins of their companions, so let them not be impatient. So woe to those who disbelieve from their Day which they are promised."
52:1-16	By the Mount. And by an inscribed Book. On parchment spread out. And by the frequented house. And by the raised ceiling. And by the filled sea. Indeed, the punishment of your Lord will come to pass. None can avert it. The Day the sky will sway with a sway. And the mountains will move. Then woe, that Day, to the deniers. Who are in vain play. The Day they are called to the fire of Hell. It will be called, [saying], “This is the Fire which you used to deny. Is this magic, or do you not see?” Enter it, and be patient or do not be patient. It is all the same for you. You will only be recompensed for what you used to do.
52:17-28	"Indeed, the righteous will be in gardens and bliss. Rejoicing in what their Lord has given them, and their Lord has protected them from the punishment of Hellfire. [They will say], ""Eat and drink at ease for what you used to do."" Reclining on lined couches, and We will marry them to fair women with large, beautiful eyes. And those who believed and whose offspring followed them in faith - We will join with them their offspring, and We will not deprive them of anything of their deeds. Every soul is pledged for what it has earned. And We will provide them with fruit and meat, whatever they desire. They will compete therein for a cup, in which there is no vain talk or sin. And there will circulate around them young boys as if they were hidden pearls. And they will turn to one another, asking one another. They will say, ""Indeed, we were before among our families fearful. But God has been gracious to us and has protected us from the punishment of the scorching wind."" Indeed, we used to call upon Him before. Indeed, it is He who is the Most Kind, the Most Merciful."
52:29-31	"So remind, for you are not, by the grace of your Lord, a soothsayer or a madman. Or do they say, ""He is a poet; we are awaiting for him a misfortune of time."" Say, ""Wait, for I am with you among those who wait."""
52:32-47	"Or do their dreams command them to do this, or are they a transgressing people? Or do they just say, ""You say it""? Rather, they do not believe. So let them produce a statement like it, if they should be truthful. Or were they created by nothing, or are they the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Rather, they are not certain. Or do they have the treasures of your Lord, or are they the controllers? Or do they have a ladder by which they listen? So let their listener produce clear authority. Or do they have daughters, and you have sons? Or do you ask them for a reward, so they are burdened with debt? Or do they have the unseen, so they write down? Or do they intend a plan? Then those who disbelieve are the ones who are plotted against. Or do they have a deity other than Allah? Glory be to Allah, above what they associate with Him. And if they see a fragment of the sky falling, they say, ""It is only clouds piled up."" So leave them until they meet their Day on which they will be struck dumb - a Day when their plot will not avail them at all, nor will they be aided. And indeed, for those who do wrong is a punishment less than that, but most of them do not know."
52:48-49	And be patient for the decision of your Lord, for indeed, you are in Our eyes. And exalt [Allah] with praise when you rise. And during part of the night exalt Him and at the decline of the stars.
53:1-18	And the star when it goes down. Your companion has not strayed, nor has he erred. Nor does he speak from [his own] inclination. It is not but a revelation revealed. He was taught by one mighty in strength. Of great strength, he rose up. And he was at the highest horizon. Then he drew near and came down. And was two bow lengths away or even nearer. Then He revealed to His Servant what He revealed. The heart does not lie about what it has seen. Do you then dispute with him about what he sees? But he had already seen him at another descent. By the Lote Tree of the Limit. Near it is the Garden of Refuge. When that which covers the Lote Tree covers it. His sight did not swerve, nor did it transgress. He certainly saw of the greatest signs of his Lord.
53:19-30	Have you considered Al-Lat and Al-Uzza, and Manat, the third, the other? Is it for you the male and for Him the female? That, indeed, is an unfair division. They are not but names which you have named, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. They follow not except assumption and what their souls desire, and there has already come to them from their Lord guidance. Or does man have whatever he desires? To Allah belongs the Hereafter and the first [form of life]. And how many are there angels in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except after Allah has given permission to whom He wills and is pleased with. Indeed, those who do not believe in the Hereafter name the angels with female names, but they have no knowledge thereof. They follow not except assumption, and indeed assumption avails not against the truth at all. So turn away from he who turns away from Our message and desires not except the life of this world. That is the extent of their knowledge. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is guided.
53:31-41	To Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth, that He may reward those who do evil for what they have done and reward those who do good with goodness - [that is,] those who avoid major sins and immoralities, except minor ones. Indeed, your Lord is Vast in forgiveness. He is most knowing of you when He created you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers. So do not claim yourselves to be pure. He is most knowing of who fears Allah. Have you seen he who turns away and gives little and restricts? Does he have knowledge of the unseen so that he sees? Or has he not been informed of what is in the scriptures of Moses and Abraham, who fulfilled [his duty]? No soul shall bear the burden of another. And that man can have nothing but what he strives for. And that his striving will soon be seen. Then He will recompense him with the fullest recompense.
53:42-56	And that to your Lord is the final destination. And that it is He who makes laugh and weep. And that it is He who causes death and gives life. And that He created the two mates, the male and the female, from a sperm-drop when it is emitted. And that upon Him is the other creation. And that it is He who enriches and satisfies. And that it is He who is the Lord of Sirius. And that He destroyed the former 'Aad and Thamud, but He left nothing behind. And the people of Noah before. Indeed, they were more unjust and insolent. And the overturned city - He inclined. So that which covered it covered it. Then which of the favors of your Lord do you dispute? This is one of the first warnings.
53:57-62	The approaching end has drawn near. None can avert it but Allah. Is it at this statement that you marvel? And you laugh and do not weep, while you are heedless. So prostrate to Allah and worship Him.
54:1-8	"The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has split. And if they see a sign, they turn away and say, ""Persistent magic."" But they deny and follow their own desires, and every matter is settled. And there has already come to them of the news that in which there is a deterrent - [that is] wisdom conclusive. But of no avail are the warnings. So turn away from them on the Day when the caller will call to a thing terrible. Their eyes humbled, they will emerge from the graves as if they were locusts scattered about. Hastening toward the caller, the disbelievers will say, ""This is a difficult day."""
54:9-17	The people of Noah denied before them. They denied Our servant and said, “He is mad,” and he was warned. But he called upon his Lord, “Indeed, I am overcome, so help.” Then We opened the gates of heaven with pouring water and caused springs to gush forth from the earth, and the waters met by a command already decreed. And We carried him on planks and nails, flowing under Our eyes as recompense for him who had disbelieved. And We have certainly left it as a sign, so is there any who will remember? But how was My punishment and my warnings? And We have certainly made the Qur’an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?
54:18-22	The tribe of Aad denied, so how was My punishment and My warnings? Indeed, We sent upon them a furious wind on a day of continuous misfortune, Which took away people as if they were trunks of uprooted palm trees. So how was My punishment and My warnings? And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?
54:23-32	"Thamud denied the warnings. They said, ""Is it only a human being from among us whom we should follow? Indeed, if we did, we would be in error and madness."" Shall the Reminder be sent down to him from among us? Rather, he is a wicked liar. They will know tomorrow who is the wicked liar. Indeed, We are sending the she-camel as a trial for them, so watch them and be patient. And inform them that the water is to be divided between them, each drinking in turn. But they called to their companion, and he seized it and hamstrung it. ""How [above was] My punishment and My warnings? Indeed, We sent upon them a single blast, and at once they were like dry stubble. And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember?"""
54:33-42	The people of Lot denied the warning. Indeed, We sent upon them a storm of stones, except for the family of Lot. We saved them at dawn [a favor from Us]. Thus do We reward the grateful. And he had already warned them of Our punishment, but they disputed concerning the warning. And they had certainly tried to seduce him from his guest, but We blinded their eyes, so taste My punishment and My warning. And indeed, a lasting punishment overtook them early in the morning. So taste My punishment and My warning. And We have certainly made the Qur'an easy for remembrance, so is there any who will remember? And the warnings had already come to the people of Pharaoh. They denied all Our signs, so We seized them with the grip of the Almighty, the Powerful.
54:43-46	"Are your disbelievers better than those? Or have you an innocence in the scriptures? Or do they say, ""We are all victorious""? The multitude will be defeated and they will turn their backs. Rather, the Hour is their appointed time, and the Hour is more grievous and bitter."
54:47-50	Indeed, the criminals are in error and madness. The Day they are dragged into the Fire on their faces, [it will be said], “Taste the touch of Hellfire.” Indeed, all things We created with predestination. And Our command is but one, like the blinking of an eye.
54:51-55	And We have certainly destroyed your followers, so is there any who will remember? And everything they did is in the books. And every small and great thing is recorded. Indeed, the righteous will be among gardens and rivers, in a seat of truth near a Sovereign, All-Powerful.
55:1-13	The Most Gracious. He taught the Qur’an. He created man. He taught him clear speech. The sun and the moon [by precise calculation]. And the stars and the trees prostrate. And the heaven He raised and set the balance. Do not transgress within the balance. And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance. And the earth He laid out for all creatures. Therein is fruit and palm trees having sheaths and grain having husks and fragrant herbs. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
55:14-16	He created man from clay like that of pottery. And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
55:17-25	Lord of the two Easts and Lord of the two Wests. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? He has released the two seas meeting together. Between them is a barrier which they do not transgress. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? He has issued from both of them pearls and coral. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? And to Him belong the ships, lofty heights in the sea like mountains. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
55:26-32	Everything on it will perish. But the Face of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor, will abide. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? He is questioned by whoever is in the heavens and the earth. Every day He is concerned with a matter. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? We will attend to you, O two heavy burdens. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
55:33-36	O company of jinn and mankind, if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass. You will not pass except by authority. Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny? He will send upon you a flame of fire and copper, and you will not aid yourselves. Then which of the favors of your Lord will you deny?
55:37-45	Then, when the heaven is split open and becomes rose-colored like oil, then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? On that Day no human being or jinn will be asked about his sin. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? The criminals will be known by their mark, and they will be seized by the forelocks and the feet. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? This is Hell, which the criminals deny. They will circulate between it and scalding water. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny?
55:46-78	And for him who fears standing before his Lord are two gardens. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Having spreading branches. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? In them are two flowing springs. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? In them are every kind of fruit in pairs. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Reclining on couches, their linings of fine brocade, and the fruit of the two gardens is near at hand. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? In them are maidens limiting their glances, untouched before them by man or jinn. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? As if they were rubies and coral. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Is the reward for good [anything] but good? So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? And below them are two gardens. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Deep in the sky. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? In them are two flowing springs. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? In them are fruits and palm trees and pomegranates. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? In them are good and beautiful things. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Houris confined in pavilions. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? No man or jinn has touched them before them. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Reclining on green cushions and beautiful velvet. Then which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Blessed is the name of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor.
56:1-10	When the event occurs. There is no liar in its occurrence. Lowering, raising. When the earth shakes with a violent shaking. And the mountains are crushed. And become scattered dust. And you are three types. So the companions of the right - who are the companions of the right? And the companions of the left - who are the companions of the left? And the foremost - who are the foremost.
56:11-26	"Those who are brought near. In the Gardens of Pleasure. A company of the former peoples. And a few of the latter. On couches lined up. Reclining on them, facing each other. Immortal youths will circulate around them. With goblets and pitchers and a cup from a pure flowing spring. They will not suffer headaches from it, nor will they suffer from intoxication. And fruit of whatever they choose. And the flesh of fowl of whatever they desire. And wide-eyed houris like hidden pearls. A reward for what they used to do. They will hear therein no idle talk or sin, except the saying, ""Peace, peace."""
56:27-40	And the companions of the right - what are the companions of the right? Among thornless lote trees And banana trees in layers And extended shade And flowing water And abundant fruit, Neither forbidden nor forbidden, And raised couches. Indeed, We created them of a special creation. And made them virgins, Loving of equal age. For the companions of the right - a group of the former peoples And a group of the latter peoples.
56:41-56	And the companions of the left - what are the companions of the left? In scorching winds and scalding water. And in the shade of scalding water. Neither cool nor generous. Indeed, they were before that in luxury. And they persisted in the grave perjury. And they used to say, “When we die and become dust and bones, shall we indeed be resurrected? Or our forefathers of old?” Say, “Indeed, the first and the last will be gathered together for an appointed time on a known Day.” Then indeed, you, O lost ones, the deniers, will eat from the tree of Zaqqum. And fill your bellies therewith. And drink thereon of scalding water. And drink as you drink running water. This is their lodging on the Day of Judgment.
56:57-62	We created you, so why do you not believe? Have you seen that which you wish for? Is it you who create it, or are We the Creator? We have decreed death among you, and We are not to be outdone. That We may substitute for you others like you and produce you in that which you do not know. And you have certainly known the first creation, so why do you not remember?
56:63-74	Have you seen what you till? Is it you who sow it, or are We the sower? If We willed, We could have made it debris, and you would continue to laugh. Indeed, we are the losers. Rather, we are the deprived. Have you seen the water that you drink? Is it you who sent it down from the clouds, or are We the sender? If We willed, We could have made it bitter, so why are you not grateful? Have you seen the fire which you kindle? Is it you who produced its tree, or are We the producer? We have made it a reminder and a provision for the needy. So exalt the name of your Lord, the Great.
56:75-80	So I swear by the positions of the stars. And indeed, it is a great oath, if you but knew. Indeed, it is a noble Qur’an. In a protected book. None touches it except the purified. A revelation from the Lord of the worlds.
56:81-87	Is it this statement that you are infatuated with? And that you make your provision that you lie? Then why, when it reaches the throat, and you are at that time looking on - And We are nearer to it than you, but you do not see - why, if you should not be held accountable, why do you not return it, if you should be truthful?
56:88-96	But if he was of those brought near [to Allah], then there will be comfort and basil and a garden of delight. But if he was of the companions of the right, then “Peace be upon you from the companions of the right.” But if he was of the deniers and those astray, then there will be an entertainment of scalding water and burning in Hellfire. Indeed, this is the truth with certainty. So exalt the name of your Lord, the Great.
57:1-6	Glorify Allah, whatever is in the heavens and the earth, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth. He gives life and causes death, and He is over all things competent. He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent, and He is Knowing of all things. It is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then established Himself on the Throne. He knows what enters into the earth and what emerges from it and what descends from the heaven and what ascends therein. And He is with you wherever you are. And Allah, of what you do, is Seeing. His is the dominion of the heavens and the earth, and to Allah all matters are returned. He merges the night into the day and merges the day into the night. And He is Knowing of that within the breasts.
57:7-11	Believe in Allah and His Messenger and spend from that over which He has made you successors. And those of you who believe and spend will have a great reward. And what is [the matter] with you that you do not believe in Allah while the Messenger invites you to believe in your Lord and He has taken your covenant, if you are believers? It is He who sends down to His Servant clear verses that He may bring you out from darknesses into the light. And indeed, Allah is to you Kind and Merciful. And what is [the matter] with you that you do not spend in the cause of Allah - while to Allah belongs the inheritance of the heavens and the earth. Not equal among you are those who spent before the conquest and fought. Those are greater in degree than those who spent afterwards and fought. And to all Allah has promised good, and Allah is Acquainted with what you do. Who is it that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply it for him? And he will have a noble reward.
57:12-15	"The Day you see the believing men and believing women, their light proceeding before them and on their right, [it will be] good news for you this Day of gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein you will abide eternally. That is what is the great attainment. The Day the hypocrites, men and women, will say to those who have believed, ""Wait for us that we may take some of your light."" It will be said, ""Go back behind you and seek light."" Then a wall will be placed between them having a door, within which is mercy, but outside of it is punishment. They will call out to them, ""Were we not with you?"" They will say, ""Yes, but you tempted yourselves and waited and doubted, and wishful thinking deceived you until the command of Allah came, and the Deceiver deceived you about Allah. So this Day no ransom will be taken from you or from those who disbelieved. Your refuge is the Fire; it is your protector, and wretched is the destination."""
57:16-17	Has not the time come for those who have believed that their hearts should become humbly submissive at the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of the truth and not be like those who were given the Scripture before, then a long period passed over them and their hearts hardened, and many of them are wicked. Know that Allah gives life to the earth after its lifelessness. We have made clear to you the signs that you may understand.
57:18-21	Indeed, the men who give charity, men who give charity, and lend Allah a goodly loan - it will be multiplied for them, and they will have a noble reward. And those who believe in Allah and His messengers - those are the truthful and the martyrs with their Lord - they will have their reward and their light. But those who disbelieve and deny Our verses - those are the companions of Hellfire. Know that the life of this world is but amusement and diversion and adornment and boasting to one another and competition in increase of wealth and children - like the example of rain whose vegetation pleases the disbelievers, then it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes debris. And in the Hereafter is severe punishment and forgiveness from Allah and approval. And what is the life of this world except the enjoyment of delusion. Race one another toward forgiveness from your Lord and a Garden whose width is like the width of the heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His messengers. That is the bounty of Allah. He bestows it on whom He wills, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty.
57:22-24	No disaster strikes upon the earth or among yourselves except that it is in a register before We bring it into being - indeed that, for Allah, is easy - so that you may not grieve for what has escaped you or exult over what He has given you. And Allah does not like everyone self-deluded and boastful. Those who are stingy and enjoin stinginess on people. But whoever turns away - then indeed, Allah is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy.
57:25-27	We sent Our messengers with clear proofs and sent down with them the Scripture and the balance that people may maintain justice. And We sent down iron, wherein is mighty force and benefits for people, and that Allah may make evident who supports Him and His messengers unseen. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might. And We had certainly sent Noah and Abraham, and placed among their descendants prophethood and the Scripture, but among them is [someone] who is guided, and many of them are wicked. Then We followed up in their footsteps with Our messengers, and We followed up with Jesus, the son of Mary, and gave him the Gospel and placed in the hearts of those who followed him kindness and mercy. And monasticism, which they innovated - We did not prescribe it for them except seeking the pleasure of Allah, but they did not observe it with its right observance. So We gave those who believed among them their reward, and many of them are wicked.
57:28-29	O you who have believed, fear Allah and believe in His Messenger. He will give you a double portion of His mercy and provide for you a light by which you will walk and forgive you. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful - So that the People of the Scripture will know that they have no power over any of the bounty of Allah and that bounty is in the hand of Allah. He gives it to whom He wills. And Allah is the possessor of great bounty.
58:1-4	Allah has heard the statement of the one who argues with you concerning her husband and directs a complaint to Allah. And Allah hears your dialogue. Indeed, Allah is Hearing and Seeing. Those among you who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives - they are not their mothers. Their mothers are only those who gave birth to them. And indeed, they say an evil word and a lie. And indeed, Allah is Pardoning and Forgiving. And those who swear not to have sexual relations with their wives and then go back on what they said - the freeing of a slave before they touch each other. That is what you are admonished to do. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do. But whoever cannot find [a slave] - then a fast of two months consecutively before they touch each other. And whoever is not able - then the feeding of sixty poor persons. That is so that you may believe in Allah and His Messenger. And these are the limits set by Allah. And for the disbelievers is a painful punishment.
58:5-6	Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger will be humiliated, as were those before them. And We have sent down clear signs, and for the disbelievers is a humiliating punishment. On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all and inform them of what they did - Allah had enumerated it, while they had forgotten it. And Allah is Witness over all things.
58:7-10	"Have you not seen that Allah knows whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth? There is not a secret conversation between three but He is their fourth, nor five but He is their sixth, nor fewer than that or more but He is with them wherever they are. Then He will inform them of what they did on the Day of Resurrection. Indeed, Allah is Knowing of all things. Have you not seen those who were forbidden secret conversation, then they return to what they were forbidden and confer about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger? And when they come to you, they greet you with that with which Allah has not greeted you, and they say within themselves, ""Why does Allah not punish us for what we say?"" Sufficient for them is Hell, which they will burn, so wretched is the destination. O you who have believed, when you confer privately, do not confer about sin and aggression and disobedience to the Messenger, but confer about righteousness and piety. And fear Allah, to whom you will be gathered. Secret conversation is only from Satan that he may grieve those who have believed, but he will not harm them at all except by Allah's permission. And upon Allah let the believers put their trust."
58:11-11	"O you who have believed, when you are told, ""Make room in assemblies,"" then make room; Allah will make room for you. And when you are told, ""Arise,"" then rise. Allah will raise those who have believed among you and those who were given knowledge, by degrees. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do."
58:12-13	O you who have believed, when you confer privately with the Messenger, present before your private conversation a charity. That is better for you and purer. But if you cannot find [anything], then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Did you fear to present before your private conversation a charity? But since you did not do so and Allah has turned to you in forgiveness, then establish prayer and give zakah and obey Allah and His Messenger. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do.
58:14-21	"Have you not considered those who took as allies a people with whom Allah has become angry? They are not of you, nor of them, and they swear to a lie while they know. Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. Indeed, evil was that which they did. They took their oaths as a shield, so they averted [people] from the way of Allah. So for them is a humiliating punishment. Never will their wealth or their children avail them at all against Allah. Those are the companions of the Fire; they will abide therein eternally. The Day Allah will resurrect them all, they will swear to Him as they swear to you, and they think that they are upon something. Unquestionably, it is they who are the liars. Satan has overcome them and made them forget the remembrance of Allah. Those are the party of Satan. Unquestionably, it is the party of Satan that are the losers. Indeed, those who oppose Allah and His Messenger - those are among the most debased. Allah has decreed, ""I will surely prevail, I and My messengers."" Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might."
58:22-22	You will not find a people who believe in Allah and the Last Day having affection for those who oppose Allah and His Messenger, even if they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred. Those - He has inscribed within their hearts faith and supported them with spirit from Him. And He will admit them to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. Allah is pleased with them, and they are pleased with Him. Those are the party of Allah. Unquestionably, the party of Allah - they are the successful ones.
59:1-5	Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts God, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. It is He who expelled those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture from their homes at the first gathering. You did not think that they would be expelled, and they thought that their fortresses would protect them from God. But God came upon them from where they did not expect and cast terror into their hearts. They destroyed their homes with their own hands and the hands of the believers. So take heed, you who have insight. And had God not decreed for them exile, He would have punished them in this world, and in the Hereafter they will have the punishment of the Fire. That is because they opposed God and His Messenger. And whoever opposes God - then indeed, God is severe in penalty. Whatever palm trees you cut down or left standing on their roots was by permission of God and in order that He might disgrace the wicked.
59:6-7	And whatever Allah has bestowed on His Messenger from them - you did not urge upon it any horses or camels, but Allah gives authority to His messengers over whom He wills, and Allah has power over all things. Whatever Allah has bestowed on His Messenger from the people of the towns - it belongs to Allah and to the Messenger and to the near relatives and the orphans and the needy and the traveler - so that it will not be a circulating gift among the rich among you. And whatever the Messenger has given you - take; and what he has forbidden you - refrain from. And fear Allah; indeed, Allah is severe in penalty.
59:8-10	"For the poor emigrants who were expelled from their homes and their properties, seeking bounty from Allah and approval and supporting Allah and His Messenger - those are the truthful. And those who were established in the Home and in the faith before them love those who emigrated to them and find not in their breasts any need for what the emigrants were given and give them preference over themselves, even though they were in privation. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful. And those who came after them say, ""Our Lord, forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in faith and put not in our hearts [any] resentment toward those who have believed. Our Lord, indeed You are Kind and Merciful."""
59:11-17	"Have you not seen those who are hypocrites? They say to their brothers who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture, ""If you are expelled, we will surely go out with you, and we will never obey anyone concerning you, ever. And if you are fought, we will surely aid you. And God bears witness that they are liars."" If they are expelled, they will not go out with them, and if they are fought, they will not aid them, and if they aid them, they will turn their backs and then will not be aided. Indeed, you are more fearful in their hearts than God. That is because they are a people who do not understand. They do not fight you all together except within fortified towns or from behind walls. Their violence among themselves is severe. You think they are together, but their hearts are diverse. That is because they are a people who do not reason. Like the example of those before them, shortly after. They tasted the evil consequences of their deed, and for them is a painful punishment. Like the example of Satan when he said to man, ""Disbelieve."" But when he disbelieved, he said, ""Indeed, I am disassociated from you. Indeed, I fear God, Lord of the worlds."" So the outcome for both of them was that they were both in the Fire, abiding eternally therein. And that is the recompense of the wrongdoers."
59:18-20	O you who have believed, fear Allah and let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow and fear Allah. Indeed, Allah is Acquainted with what you do. And do not be like those who forgot Allah , so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient. Not equal are the companions of the Fire and the companions of Paradise. The companions of Paradise - they are the successful.
59:21-24	If We had sent down this Qur'an upon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of Allah. And these examples We present to the people that perhaps they will give thought. He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. He is Allah, other than whom there is no deity, the Sovereign, the Holy, the Peace, the Giver of Security, the Guardian, the Almighty, the Compeller, the Proud. Glory be to Allah, above what they associate with Him. He is Allah, the Creator, the Inventor, the Fashioner. To Him belong the best names. Whatever is in the heavens and earth exalts Him. And He is the Almighty, the Wise.
60:1-3	O you who have believed, do not take My enemies and your enemies as allies, extending to them affection while they have disbelieved in what came to you of the truth. They expel the Messenger and you [from believing] in Allah, your Lord. If you have come out [to fight] in My cause and seeking My pleasure, [then] secretly [do] them affection - and I know what you have concealed and what you have declared. And whoever does [this] among you has certainly strayed from the soundness of the way. If they should gain the upper hand over you, they will be enemies to you and stretch out against you their hands and tongues with evil, and they wish that you would disbelieve. Neither your kinship nor your children will benefit you on the Day of Resurrection. He will judge between you, and Allah is Seeing of what you do.
60:4-7	"There has certainly been for you an excellent pattern in Abraham and those with him, when they said to their people, ""Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship besides God. We have rejected you, and there has arisen between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in God alone."" Except for the saying of Abraham to his father, ""I will surely ask forgiveness for you, and I do not possess for you anything from God. Our Lord, upon You we have relied, and to You we have turned [in repentance], and to You is the final destination. Our Lord, do not make us a trial for those who disbelieve and forgive us, our Lord. Indeed, You are the Exalted in Might, the Wise."" There has certainly been for you in them an excellent pattern for anyone whose hope is in God and the Last Day. But whoever turns away - then indeed, God is the Free of need, the Praiseworthy. Perhaps God will establish between you and those of them with whom you are enemies affection. And God is Powerful. And God is Forgiving and Merciful."
60:8-9	Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. Allah only forbids you from those who fight you because of religion and expel you from your homes and aid in your expulsion - from making friends with them. And whoever makes friends with them - then it is those who are the wrongdoers.
60:10-11	O you who have believed, when believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them. Allah is most knowing as to their faith. And if you ascertain that they are believers, do not return them to the disbelievers. They are not lawful for them, nor are they lawful for them. And give them what they have spent. There is no blame upon you if you marry them when you have given them their due compensation. And do not hold on to the marriage contract of disbelieving women. And ask for what you have spent, and let them ask for what they have spent. That is the decision of Allah, which judges between you. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. And if any of your wives have gone to the disbelievers, and you punish them, then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they have spent. And fear Allah, in whom you are believers.
60:12-13	O Prophet, when believing women come to you pledging allegiance to you that they will not associate anything with Allah nor steal nor commit adultery nor kill their children nor bring forth a slander they have invented between their hands and feet nor disobey you in what is right - then accept their pledge and ask forgiveness for them from Allah. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. O you who have believed, do not take as allies those upon whom Allah has become angry. They have despaired of the Hereafter, just as the disbelievers have despaired of the inhabitants of the graves.
61:1-4	Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts God. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. O you who have believed, why do you say that which you do not do? Great is hatred in the sight of God that you say that which you do not do. Indeed, God loves those who fight in His cause in ranks as if they were a solid structure.
61:5-5	"And when Moses said to his people, ""O my people, why do you harm me while you know that I am the Messenger of God to you?"" But when they deviated, God caused their hearts to deviate. And God does not guide the defiantly disobedient people."
61:6-9	"And [mention] when Jesus, the son of Mary, said, ""O Children of Israel, indeed I am the Messenger of Allah to you, confirming what came before me of the Torah and bringing good tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name will be Ahmad."" But when he came to them with clear proofs, they said, ""This is obvious magic."" And who is more unjust than he who invents a lie about Allah while he is invited to Islam? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. They intend to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah will perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it. It is He who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion, although the polytheists dislike it."
61:10-14	"O you who have believed, shall I guide you to a commerce that will save you from a painful punishment? [You] believe in Allah and His Messenger and strive in the cause of Allah with your wealth and your lives. That is best for you, if you only knew. He will forgive you your sins and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in gardens of perpetual bliss. That is the great attainment. And [there is] another which you love - victory from Allah and an imminent conquest. And give good tidings to the believers. O you who have believed, be supporters of Allah, as Jesus, the son of Mary, said to the disciples, ""Who are my supporters for Allah?"" The disciples said, ""We are supporters of Allah."" So a party of the Children of Israel believed and a party disbelieved, so We supported those who believed against their enemy, and they became dominant."
62:1-4	Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts God - the King, the Holy, the Exalted in Might, the Wise. It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves reciting to them His verses and purifying them and teaching them the Book and wisdom - although they were before in clear error - and others from among them who have not yet joined them. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Wise. That is the bounty of God. He bestows it on whom He wills, and God is the possessor of great bounty.
62:5-8	"The parable of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not uphold it is like that of a donkey carrying volumes. Wretched is the parable of the people who deny the verses of Allah. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. Say, ""O you who are Jews, if you claim that you are allies of Allah to the exclusion of all others, then wish for death, if you should be truthful."" But they will never wish for it, because of what their hands have put forth. And Allah is Knowing of the wrongdoers. Say, ""Indeed, the death from which you flee - it will surely meet you; then you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you about what you used to do."""
62:9-11	"O you who have believed, when the call is made for the prayer on the day of Jumu'ah [Friday], then proceed to the remembrance of Allah and leave business. That is better for you, if you only knew. And when the prayer has been concluded, disperse within the land and seek from the bounty of Allah and remember Allah much that you may be successful. And when they see a transaction or amusement, they disperse to it and leave you standing. Say, ""What is with Allah is better than amusement and business. And Allah is the best of providers."""
63:1-4	"When the hypocrites come to you, they say, ""We bear witness that you are the Messenger of Allah."" And Allah knows that you are His Messenger, and Allah bears witness that the hypocrites are liars. They have taken their oaths as a shield and averted [people] from the way of Allah. Indeed, evil is that which they used to do. That is because they believed and then disbelieved, so their hearts were sealed up so they do not understand. And when you see them, their bodies impress you. And if they speak, you listen to their speech. They are as if they were propped up pieces of wood. They think that every shout is against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. May Allah destroy them! How are they deluded?"
63:5-8	"And when it is said to them, ""Come, that the Messenger of Allah may ask forgiveness for you,"" they turn their heads away, and you see them turning away while they are arrogant. It is all the same to them whether you ask forgiveness for them or do not ask forgiveness for them - Allah will never forgive them. Indeed, Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people. They are the ones who say, ""Do not spend on those who are with the Messenger of Allah until they disperse."" And to Allah belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth, but the hypocrites do not understand. They say, ""If we return to Medina, the more honorable will surely expel therefrom the more humble."" But to Allah belongs honor and to His Messenger and to the believers, but the hypocrites do not know."
63:9-11	"O you who have believed, let not your wealth or your children divert you from the remembrance of Allah. And whoever does that - then those are the losers. And spend from what We have provided for you before death approaches one of you and he says, ""My Lord, if only You would delay me for a short term so I could give charity and be among the righteous."" And Allah will not delay a soul when its term has come. And Allah is Acquainted with what you do."
64:1-4	Whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth exalts God. His is the dominion and His is the praise. And He is over all things competent. It is He who created you, and among you are disbelievers and among you are believers. And God, of what you do, is Seeing. He created the heavens and the earth in truth. And He formed you and perfected your forms. And to Him is the final destination. He knows what is in the heavens and the earth and He knows what you conceal and what you declare. And God is Knowing of that within the breasts.
64:5-6	Has there not come to you the news of those who disbelieved before? So they tasted the consequences of their deed, and for them is a painful punishment. That was because their messengers used to come to them with clear proofs, but they said, “Shall human beings guide us?” So they disbelieved and turned away, and God became free of need - and God is Free of need and Praiseworthy.
64:7-10	"Those who disbelieve claim that they will never be resurrected. Say, ""Yes, by my Lord, you will surely be resurrected; then you will surely be informed of what you did. And that, for Allah, is easy."" So believe in Allah and His Messenger and the light which We have sent down. And Allah, with what you do, is Acquainted. The Day He will assemble you for the Day of Assembly - that is the Day of Loss. And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness - He will remove from him his misdeeds and admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment. But those who disbelieve and deny Our verses - those are the companions of the Fire, abiding eternally therein, and wretched is the destination."
64:11-13	No disaster strikes except by permission of Allah. And whoever believes in Allah - He will guide his heart. And Allah is Knowing of all things. And obey Allah and obey the Messenger. But if you turn away - then upon Our Messenger is only the clear notification. Allah - there is no deity except Him, and upon Allah let the believers rely.
64:14-18	O you who have believed, indeed, among your wives and your children are enemies to you, so beware of them. But if you pardon and overlook and forgive - then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Your wealth and your children are only a trial, and Allah has with Him a great reward. So fear Allah as much as you are able, and listen and obey, and spend [in the way of Allah]; it is better for yourselves. And whoever is protected from the stinginess of his soul - it is those who will be the successful. If you loan Allah a goodly loan, He will multiply it for you and forgive you. And Allah is Most Appreciative and Forbearing. Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, the Exalted in Might, the Wise.
65:1-3	O Prophet, when you divorce women, divorce them at their prescribed period and count the waiting period and fear Allah, your Lord. Do not turn them out of their houses, nor should they leave unless they commit a clear immorality. These are the limits set by Allah. And whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself. You do not know, perhaps Allah will bring about after that something new. But when they have fulfilled their term, either retain them according to acceptable terms or part from them according to acceptable terms. And bring to witness two just men among you and establish the testimony for Allah. This is admonished for whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whoever fears Allah, He will make for him a way out. And He will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him. Indeed, Allah will accomplish His purpose. Allah has already set for everything a [decreed] extent.
65:4-7	And those of your women who have despaired of menstruation, if you doubt, their period is three months. And for those who have not menstruated, and for those who are pregnant, their term is until they give birth. And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him of his matter ease. That is the command of Allah which He has revealed to you. And whoever fears Allah - He will remove from him his misdeeds and increase for him a great reward. Accommodate them where you dwell according to your means, and do not harm them in order to impose hardship on them. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them until they give birth. And if they breastfeed for you, then give them their compensation and consult among yourselves in kindness. But if you disagree, then another woman will breastfeed for him. Let one who is well-off spend according to his means, and he whose provision is restricted - let him spend from what Allah has given him. Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacity. Allah will bring about, after hardship, ease.
65:8-12	And how many a town rebelled against the command of its Lord and His messengers, so We brought it to a severe reckoning and punished it with a terrible punishment. So it tasted the evil consequences of its deed, and the outcome of its deed was loss. Allah has prepared for them a severe punishment. So fear Allah, O you of understanding who have believed. Allah has sent down to you a message, a Messenger reciting to you the clear verses of Allah, that He may bring forth those who have believed and done righteous deeds from darkness into the light. And whoever believes in Allah and does righteousness - He will admit him to gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide forever. Allah has certainly been good to him in provision. Allah is He who created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof. The Command descends among them - that you may know that Allah is over all things competent and that Allah encompasses all things in His knowledge.
66:1-5	O Prophet, why do you forbid what Allah has made lawful to you, seeking to please your wives? And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Allah has already prescribed for you the expiation of your oaths. And Allah is your Protector, and He is the Knowing, the Wise. And when the Prophet confided a statement to one of his wives, then when she informed him of it and Allah disclosed it to him, he recognized part of it and ignored part. But when he informed her of it, she said, “Who informed you of this?” He said, “The Knowing, the Acquainted informed me.” If you both repent to Allah, your hearts have indeed inclined. But if you both back each other up against him - then indeed, Allah is his Protector, and Gabriel and the righteous believers and the angels after that are assistants. It may be that his Lord, if he divorces you, will give him in exchange wives better than you - submissive, believing, obedient, repentant, worshipping, fasting, previously married and virgins.
66:6-7	O you who have believed, protect yourselves and your families from a Fire whose fuel is people and stones, over which are [appointed] angels, harsh and severe; they do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do what they are commanded. O you who have disbelieved, make no excuses this Day. You will only be recompensed for what you used to do.
66:8-8	O you who have believed, repent to Allah with sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord will remove from you your misdeeds and admit you to gardens beneath which rivers flow. The Day when Allah will not disgrace the Prophet and those who believed with him. Their light will proceed before them and on their right, saying, “Our Lord, perfect for us our light and forgive us. Indeed, You are over all things competent.”
66:9-9	O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination.
66:10-12	"Allah presents an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants, but they betrayed them. So those two servants did not avail them at all against Allah, and it was said, ""Enter the Fire with those who enter."" And Allah presents an example for those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh, when she said, ""My Lord, build for me, near You, a house in Paradise and save me from Pharaoh and his deeds and save me from the wrongdoing people."" And Mary, the daughter of Imran, who guarded her chastity, so We breathed into her of Our spirit, and she believed in the words of her Lord and His scriptures and was of the devout."
67:1-5	Blessed is He in whose hand is dominion, and He is over all things competent. He who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed. And He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving. He who created seven heavens in layers. You do not see in the creation of the Most Gracious any inconsistency. So return your sight - do you see any flaw? Then return your sight a second time - your sight will return to you humbled while it is weary. And We have certainly adorned the lowest heaven with lamps and made them missiles against the devils and have prepared for them the punishment of the Blaze.
67:6-11	"And for those who disbelieve in their Lord is the punishment of Hell, and wretched is the destination. When they are thrown into it, they will hear its roaring as it boils. It almost bursts with rage. Every time a group is thrown into it, its keepers will ask them, ""Did there not come to you a warner?"" They will say, ""Yes, a warner did come to us, but we denied and said, 'Allah has not sent down anything. You are not except in great error.'"" And they will say, ""If only we had been listening or reasoning, we would not be among the companions of the Blaze."" So they will acknowledge their sin. So away with the companions of the Blaze."
67:12-12	Indeed, those who fear their Lord in secret will have forgiveness and a great reward.
67:13-15	And whether you conceal your speech or declare it aloud, He is Knowing of that within the breasts. Does He not know He who created, while He is the Subtle, the Acquainted? It is He who made the earth subservient to you, so walk among its slopes and eat of His provision, and to Him is the resurrection.
67:16-23	Do you feel secure that He who is in the heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up and then suddenly it is turbulent? Or do you feel secure that He who is in the heaven will not send upon you a storm of stones? Then you will know how [a warner] is? And those before them denied, so how [was] My reproach. Have they not seen the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in? None holds them up except the Most Gracious. Indeed, He is, of all things, Seeing. Is this he who is an army for you to aid you instead of the Most Gracious? The disbelievers are not but in delusion. Is this he who provides for you if he should withhold his provision? Rather, they persist in insolence and aversion. Is he who walks prone on his face better guided than he who walks upright on a straight path? Say, “It is He who created you and made for you hearing and vision and hearts. Little do you give thanks.”
67:24-27	"Say, ""It is He who has dispersed you throughout the earth, and to Him you will be gathered."" And they say, ""When will this promise come to pass, if you should be truthful?"" Say, ""The knowledge is only with Allah, and I am only a clear warner."" But when they saw it approaching, the faces of those who disbelieved became dark, and it was said, ""This is what you used to call upon."""
67:28-30	"Say, ""Have you considered: if Allah should destroy me and those with me, or have mercy upon us, who can protect the disbelievers from a painful punishment?"" Say, ""He is the Most Gracious. We have believed in Him, and upon Him we rely. And you will soon know who is in clear error."" Say, ""Have you considered: if your water were to become sunken, who could bring you flowing water?"""
68:1-4	Nun. By the pen and what they inscribe. You are not, by the grace of your Lord, mad. And indeed, for you is a reward uninterrupted. And indeed, you are of a great moral character.
68:5-16	You will see, and they will see. Which of you is the afflicted? Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided. So do not obey the deniers. They wish that you would compromise, so they would compromise. And do not obey every worthless swearer, a slanderer, going about with calumnies, a preventer of good, an aggressor, a sinner, violent after that, a fornicator. If he had wealth and children, when Our verses are recited to him, he says, “Legends of the former peoples.” We will brand him on the snout.
68:17-33	"Indeed, We tested them as We tested the companions of the garden when they swore that they would harvest it in the morning. And they made no exception. Then a company from your Lord swept over it while they were asleep. And it became like a harvested field. And they called to one another in the morning, ""Go forth to your tillage, if you should harvest."" So they set out, speaking in low voices, ""Let not a poor person enter it upon you today."" And they went forth in the morning, determined and able. But when they saw it, they said, ""Indeed, we are astray. Rather, we are deprived."" The most middle of them said, ""Did I not tell you, 'Why do you not glorify Allah?'"" They said, ""Exalted is our Lord. Indeed, we were wrongdoers."" So they turned to one another, blaming each other. They said, ""Woe to us! Indeed, we were transgressors! Perhaps our Lord will substitute for us [one] better than it. Indeed, we are toward our Lord aspiring."" Such is the punishment. And the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they only knew."
68:34-41	Indeed, for the righteous are gardens of pleasure with their Lord. Should We treat the Muslims like the criminals? What is the matter with you? How do you judge? Or do you have a book in which you study? Indeed, you will have therein whatever you choose. Or do you have oaths binding upon Us until the Day of Resurrection that you will have whatever you judge? Ask them which of them is a leader for that? Or do they have partners [to Allah]? Then let them produce their partners, if they should be truthful.
68:42-47	The Day the shin will be bared and they will be called upon to prostrate, but they will not be able. Their eyes will be humbled, humiliation will overwhelm them, although they used to be called upon to prostrate, while they were sound. So leave Me and whoever denies this statement. We will gradually lead them on from where they do not perceive. And I will grant them respite. Indeed, My plan is firm. Or do you ask them for a reward, so they are burdened with debt? Or do they have the unseen, so they are writing.
68:48-52	"So be patient for the decision of your Lord, and be not like the companion of the fish when he cried out in distress. Had not grace from his Lord overtaken him, he would have been thrown out onto the open, while he was blameworthy. But his Lord chose him and made him among the righteous. And indeed, those who disbelieve would almost make you slip with their eyes when they hear the message. And they say, ""Indeed, he is mad."" But it is not but a message to the worlds."
69:1-8	The Inevitable. What is the Inevitable? And what can make you know what is the Inevitable? Thamud and Aad denied the Calamity. As for Thamud, they were destroyed by the Tyrant. And as for Aad, they were destroyed by a furious, violent wind. He imposed it upon them for seven nights and eight days in succession. So you would see the people therein fallen down as if they were hollow trunks of palm trees. Do you see any remnant of them?
69:9-12	And Pharaoh and those before him and the overthrown cities came with sin. So they disobeyed the Messenger of their Lord, so He seized them with a terrible grip. And when the water rose, We carried you in the moving ship that We might make it a reminder for you and for a hearing ear to retain it.
69:13-18	Then, when the Trumpet is blown with a single blast, the earth and the mountains will be lifted up and crushed with a single blow. On that Day the Event will occur. The heaven will split asunder, and on that Day it will be frail. Angels will be on its edges, and eight will bear the Throne of your Lord above them that Day. On that Day you will be exposed; nothing of you will be hidden.
69:19-24	"But as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will say, ""Here, read my record. Indeed, I thought that I would meet my account."" So he will be in a pleasant life, in an exalted garden, with its fruits within reach. Eat and drink at ease for what you put forth in the days gone by."
69:25-37	"But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, ""Oh, I wish I had not been given my record. And I did not know what my account was. Oh, I wish this were the final outcome. My wealth did not avail me. My power has perished from me. Seize him and chain him. Then throw him into Hellfire. Then cast him into a chain whose length is seventy cubits. Indeed, he did not believe in Allah, the Almighty. Nor did he urge the feeding of the poor. So he has no close friend here this Day, nor any food except from pure water. None shall eat it except sinners."""
69:38-52	So I swear by what you see and what you do not see. It is indeed the word of an honored Messenger. And it is not the word of a poet - little do you believe. Nor is it the word of a soothsayer - little do you remember. A revelation from the Lord of the worlds. And if he had invented about Us some sayings, We would have seized him by the right hand. Then We would have cut from him the aorta. And there is not among you any who could prevent it. And indeed, it is a reminder for the righteous. And indeed, We know that among you are deniers. And indeed, it is a cause of regret for the disbelievers. And indeed, it is the certain truth. So exalt the name of your Lord, the Great.
70:1-7	A questioner asked about a punishment to come. For the disbelievers, there is no averting it. From God, Lord of the Ascending Paths. The angels and the Spirit ascend to Him during a Day the extent of which is fifty thousand years. So be patient with beautiful patience. Indeed, they see it far off, but We see it near.
70:8-18	The Day when the sky will be like molten metal, and the mountains will be like wool. And no friend will ask another friend. They will see them. The sinner will wish that he could ransom himself from the punishment of that Day with his children, and his wife, and his brother, and his clan that sheltered him, and everyone on earth, [even] so that he could save him. No! It is a Blaze, which strips away the skin. It calls whoever turns back and turns away, and whoever gathers and stores [their food], and whoever does not, [even] will be saved.
70:19-21	Man was created anxious. If evil touches him, he is impatient. If good touches him, he withholds it.
70:22-35	Except for the praying ones. Who are constant in their prayers. And those in whose wealth is a recognized right - for the beggar and the deprived. And those who believe in the Day of Judgment. And those who are fearful of the punishment of their Lord. Indeed, the punishment of their Lord is not secure. And those who guard their private parts. Except from their wives or those their right hands possess, for indeed, they will not be blamed. But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors. And those who are to their trusts and their covenant attentive. And those who uphold their testimonies. And those who guard their prayers. Those will be in gardens, honored.
70:36-39	So what is the matter with those who disbelieved before you, that they are rushing about, to the right and to the left, in droves? Does every one of them aspire to enter a garden of pleasure? No indeed. We created them from what they know.
70:40-44	So I swear by the Lord of the Easts and the Wests that We are surely Able to replace them with better ones, and We will not be outdone. So leave them to plunge into vain talk and play until they meet their Day which they are promised - the Day they will emerge from the graves quickly as if they were, toward an idol, hastening. Their eyes will be humbled, the humiliation of that Day which they were promised will overwhelm them.
71:1-4	"Indeed, We sent Noah to his people, [saying], ""Warn your people before there comes upon them a painful punishment."" He said, ""O my people, indeed I am to you a clear warner. That you worship Allah and fear Him and obey me. He will forgive you some of your sins and deflect you for a specified term. Indeed, the term of Allah, when it comes, cannot be delayed, if you only knew."""
71:5-12	"He said, ""My Lord, indeed I have called my people night and day, but my call has only increased them in flight. And indeed, every time I called them that You might forgive them, they put their fingers in their ears, covered themselves with their garments, persisted, and were arrogant with great arrogance. Then indeed I called them openly. Then indeed I declared to them and spoke to them secretly. And I said, 'Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever Forgiving. He will send [rain from] the sky upon you in [continuing] showers. And give you increase in wealth and children and provide for you gardens and provide for you rivers.'"""
71:13-20	What is the matter with you that you do not fear Allah while He has created you in stages? Have you not seen how Allah has created seven heavens in layers? And He has placed the moon therein a light and made the sun a lamp? And Allah has caused you to grow from the earth a growth. Then He will return you into it and extract you a [new] extraction. And Allah has made the earth a carpet for you that you may walk therein on wide paths.
71:21-24	"Noah said, ""My Lord, indeed they have disobeyed me and followed one whose wealth and children increase him only in loss. And they plotted a mighty plot and said, 'Do not abandon your gods and do not abandon Wadd, Suwa', Yaghuth, Ya'uq, and Nasr.' But they have led many astray. And do not increase the wrongdoers except in error."""
71:25-28	"Because of their sins they were drowned and put into the Fire. Then they found for themselves not besides Allah any helpers. And Noah said, ""My Lord, leave not upon the earth from among the disbelievers a single dwelling. If You leave them, they will mislead Your servants and will not beget except wicked disbelievers. My Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house a believer and the believing men and believing women. And do not increase the wrongdoers except in destruction."""
72:1-7	"Say, ""It has been revealed to me that a group of jinn listened and said, 'Indeed, we have heard an amazing Qur'an. It guides to the right way, so we have believed in it. And we will never associate with our Lord anyone.' And that, exalted be He, our Lord has taken neither a wife nor a son. And that our foolish one was saying about Allah an outrage. And we thought that mankind and jinn would never tell a lie about Allah. And that there were men among mankind who sought refuge with men among the jinn, but they increased them in burden. And that they thought, as you thought, that Allah would never resurrect anyone."
72:8-13	And indeed, we have sought the heaven but found it filled with stern guards and meteors. And indeed, we used to sit therein in stations to listen. But whoever listens now will find a meteor lying in wait for him. And indeed, we do not know whether evil is intended for those on the earth, or whether their Lord intends for them a right course. And indeed, among us are the righteous, and among us are less than that. We were [only] separate paths. And indeed, we thought that we would never escape Allah upon the earth, nor could we escape Him in flight. And indeed, when we heard the guidance, we believed in it. And whoever believes in his Lord will not fear loss or oppression.
72:14-17	And among us are the Muslims, and among us are the unjust. So whoever has submitted - it is those who have sought the right course. And as for the unjust, they will be fuel for Hell. And if they had remained on the right way, We would have certainly given them abundant water to test them thereby. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord - He will cause him to enter a steadfast punishment.
72:18-24	"And that the mosques are for Allah, so do not invoke anyone along with Allah. And that when the servant of Allah stood up to invoke Him, they were about to gather around him in a crowd. Say, ""I only invoke my Lord, and I do not associate anyone with Him."" Say, ""Indeed, I do not possess for you any harm or right guidance."" Say, ""Indeed, none can protect me from Allah, and I will not find besides Him any refuge. Except for a message from Allah and His messages. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger - indeed, for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he will abide forever."" Until, when they see that which they are promised, they will know who is weaker in helpers and fewer in number."
72:25-28	"Say, ""I do not know whether that which you are promised is near, or whether my Lord has set for it a term."" He is the Knower of the unseen, and He discloses His secret to none, except to a messenger with whom He is pleased. Then He causes guards to march before him and behind him, that He may know that they have conveyed the messages of their Lord, and He encompasses what is with them and has enumerated all things in number."
73:1-9	O you wrapped in garments! Arise [to pray] during the night, except for a little - half of it, or subtract from it a little, or add to it, and recite the Qur'an with measured recitation. Indeed, We will cast upon you a weighty word. Indeed, the hours of the night are more effective for concurrence and more suitable for statement. Indeed, for you during the day is much exertion. And remember the name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with a full devotion. Lord of the East and the West - there is no god except Him, so take Him as Disposer of affairs.
73:10-14	And be patient over what they say and leave them with gracious leave. And leave Me to the deniers, possessed of ease, and grant them respite for a little. Indeed, with Us are shackles and a Hellfire. And food that chokes and a painful punishment. The Day the earth and the mountains will shake, and the mountains will become heaps of sand.
73:15-19	Indeed, We have sent to you a Messenger, a witness over you, just as We sent to Pharaoh a Messenger. But Pharaoh disobeyed the Messenger, so We seized him with a terrible punishment. So how will you guard yourself, if you disbelieve, against a Day that will make children gray-haired and the sky burst asunder? His promise will surely be fulfilled. Indeed, this is a reminder, so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way.
73:20-20	Indeed, your Lord knows that you stand [in prayer] nearly two-thirds of the night, or half of it, or a third of it, and [so do] a party of those with you. And God determines the length of the night and the day. He knows that you cannot count it, so He has turned to you in forgiveness. So recite what is easy of the Qur’an. He knows that there will be among you sick people and others traveling throughout the land seeking of the bounty of God and others fighting in the cause of God. So recite what is easy of it and establish prayer and give zakah and loan God a goodly loan. And whatever good you send forward for yourselves - you will find it with God; it is better and greater in reward. And seek forgiveness of God. Indeed, God is Forgiving and Merciful.
74:1-7	O you wrapped in garments! Arise and warn. And glorify your Lord. And purify your garments. And avoid uncleanliness. And do not bestow favors, expecting more. And for the sake of your Lord be patient.
74:8-10	Then when the trumpet is blown, that will be a difficult day, not easy for the disbelievers.
74:11-26	"Leave Me and he whom I created alone. And for whom I have given abundant wealth and sons to witness. And I have smoothed for him a [good] preparation. Then he desires that I should increase [his wealth]. No! He was, indeed, obstinate toward Our verses. I will exhaust him with a [severe] ascent. Indeed, he thought and calculated. So he killed as he calculated. Then he killed as he calculated. Then he looked. Then he frowned and was gloomy. Then he turned away and was arrogant. And he said, ""This is not but magic passed on. This is not but the word of a human being. I will drive him into Hellfire."""
74:27-31	"And what will make you know what Hellfire is? It leaves nothing behind. A scourge for mankind. Over it are nineteen angels. And We have not made the keepers of the Fire except angels. And We have not made their number except as a trial for those who disbelieve - that those who were given the Scripture will be certain and those who have believed will increase in faith and those who were given the Scripture and the believers will not doubt and that those in whose hearts is hypocrisy and the disbelievers will say, ""What does Allah intend by this as an example?"" Thus does Allah leave astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And none knows the soldiers of your Lord except Him. And it is not but a reminder to humanity."
74:32-37	No, by the moon. And by the night when it departs. And by the morning when it brightens. Indeed, it is one of the greater events. A warner to mankind - for whoever among you wills to advance or to remain behind.
74:38-48	Every soul will be held in pledge for what it has earned, Except the companions of the right. They will be in gardens, questioning one another. About the criminals, “What has brought you into Hellfire?” They will say, “We were not of those who prayed, and we did not feed the poor, and we used to engage in vain talk with those who engage in vain talk. And we used to deny the Day of Judgment, until the certainty came to us.” So what benefit will the intercession of the intercessors do to them?
74:49-56	So why do they turn away from the reminder? As if they were wild donkeys fleeing from a lion. Rather, every one of them desires to be given pages spread out. No! Rather, they do not fear the Hereafter. No! It is only a reminder. So whoever wills may remember it. And they will not remember unless Allah wills. He is the people of piety and the people of forgiveness.
75:1-15	"I swear by the Day of Resurrection. Nor do I swear by the self-reproaching soul. Does man think that We will not assemble his bones? Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers. Rather, man desires to commit blasphemy before him. He asks, ""When is the Day of Resurrection?"" Then, when the sight is dazzled, and the moon is eclipsed, and the sun and the moon are joined together, man will say on that Day, ""Where is the escape?"" No, there is no blame. To your Lord, that Day, is the final settlement. Man will be informed on that Day of what he sent forth and what he left behind. Rather, man, against himself, is a witness, even if he were to present his excuses."
75:16-19	Do not move your tongue with it to hasten it. Indeed, upon Us is its collection and its recitation. So when We have recited it, then follow its recitation. Then upon Us is its clarification.
75:20-25	No! Rather, you love the immediate [life] and neglect the Hereafter. Some faces, that Day, will be radiant, looking at their Lord. And some faces, that Day, will be dismayed, thinking that some calamity will befall them.
75:26-35	"No, when it reaches the collarbones. And it was said, ""From ascending."" And he thought it was separation. And the leg was twisted around the leg. To your Lord, that Day, is the driving. So he did not believe nor did he pray. But he lied and turned away. Then he went to his family, stretching out. It is better for you, then it is better. Then it is better for you, then it is better."
75:36-40	Does man think that he will be left neglected? Was he not a drop of ejaculated semen? Then he was a clinging clot; then He created and proportioned. Then He made from it mates, the male and the female. Is not He able to give life to the dead?
76:1-4	Has there not been over man a period of time when he was not a thing worth mentioning? Indeed, We created man from a sperm-drop mixture that We may try him; and We made him hearing and seeing. Indeed, We guided him to the way, be he grateful or ungrateful. Indeed, We have prepared for the disbelievers chains and shackles and a Blaze.
76:5-11	Indeed, the righteous will drink from a cup whose mixture is of camphor. A spring from which the servants of Allah will drink, making it gush forth abundantly. They fulfill their vows and fear a Day whose evil will be widespread. And they give food, in spite of their love for it, to the poor, the orphan, and the captive, [saying], “We feed you only for the countenance of Allah. We desire from you neither reward nor thanks. Indeed, we fear from our Lord a Day [of] distress and calamity.” So Allah saved them from the evil of that Day and met them with radiance and joy.
76:12-22	And He will reward them for their patience with a garden and silk garments. Reclining therein on couches they will see therein neither sun nor intense cold. Its shades will come near to them, and its fruits will be made accessible. And there will be passed around among them vessels of silver and goblets of crystal - crystal of silver, measured by precise measurements. And they will be given to drink therein a cup whose mixture is of ginger - a spring therein called Salsabil. And there will circulate around them immortal youths. When you see them, you will think them to be scattered pearls, but when you look back, you will see pleasure and great dominion. Above them will be green garments of fine silk and heavy brocade, and they will be adorned with bracelets of silver, and their Lord will give them to drink a pure drink. Indeed, this is your reward, and your effort is appreciated.
76:23-26	Indeed, it is We who sent down to you the Qur’an gradually. So be patient over the decision of your Lord and do not obey from among them any sinner or disbeliever. And remember the name of your Lord in the morning and the evening. And during part of the night prostrate to Him and exalt Him a long night.
76:27-28	Indeed, these love the immediate and leave behind them a heavy Day. It is We who created them and strengthened their bonds. And if We willed, We could replace them with others like them with [complete] replacement.
76:29-31	Indeed, this is a reminder, so whoever wills may take to his Lord a way. And you do not will except that Allah wills. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. He admits whom He wills into His mercy, and for the wrongdoers - He has prepared a painful punishment.
77:1-15	And the messengers sent forth in gusts. And the windstorms blowing violently. And the spreaders spreading. And the segregators separating. And the casting down a reminder. As an excuse or a warning. You are only promised what will come to pass. So when the stars are obliterated. And when the sky is split asunder. And when the mountains are blown away. And when the messengers are gathered. For what day are they reprieved? For the Day of Separation. And what can make you know what is the Day of Separation? Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
77:16-19	Did We not destroy the former peoples? Then We made the latter follow them. Thus do We deal with the criminals. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
77:20-28	Did We not create you from despised water? Then We placed it in a firm lodging [place] for a known term. So We determined [it], and excellent are the determiners. Woe, that Day, to the deniers. Did We not make the earth a receptacle for the living and the dead? And We placed therein lofty mountains and gave you to drink sweet water? Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
77:29-40	Go to that which you used to deny. Go to a shade with three branches. It provides no shade and does not protect against the flames. It throws sparks like palaces, as if they were yellow camels. Woe, that Day, to the deniers! This is a Day when they will not speak. Nor will they be permitted to apologize. Woe, that Day, to the deniers! This is the Day of Judgment. We have gathered you and the former peoples. So if you have a plan, then plan. Woe, that Day, to the deniers.
77:41-44	Indeed, the righteous will be among shades and springs and fruits of whatever they desire. Eat and drink in happiness for what you used to do. Indeed, We thus reward the doers of good.
77:45-50	"Woe, that Day, to the deniers. Eat and enjoy yourselves a little. Indeed, you are criminals. Woe, that Day, to the deniers. And when it is said to them, ""Bow down,"" they do not bow down. Woe, that Day, to the deniers. Then in what statement after this will they believe?"
78:1-5	What are they wondering about? About the great news. About which they differ? No, they will know. Then no, they will know.
78:6-16	Have We not made the earth a bed, and the mountains pegs? And created you in pairs? And made your sleep for rest, and made the night for clothing, and made the day for livelihood, and built above you seven strong mountains, and made a blazing lamp, and sent down from the pressed clouds abundant water, that We may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation, and gardens of abundant rain.
78:17-20	The Day of Judgment is a time appointed. It is the Day when the Trumpet will be blown and you will come in multitudes. The heaven will be opened and become gates. The mountains will be set in motion and will become a mirage.
78:21-30	Hell has been lying in wait for the transgressors as a place of return. They will abide therein for ages. They will not taste therein coolness or drink, but only scalding water and pus. A just recompense. Indeed, they never expected an account. And they denied Our signs with a lie. And all things We have recorded in a book. So taste [the punishment], and We will not increase you except in torment.
78:31-37	Indeed, for the righteous is success. Gardens and vineyards, And full-breasted maidens of equal age, And a full cup. Neither will they hear therein ill speech nor falsehood. A reward from your Lord, a gift according to account. Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them - the Most Merciful. They do not possess from Him any speech.
78:38-40	The Day the Spirit and the angels will stand in rows. They will not speak except for one to whom the Most Merciful permits, and he will say what is right. That is the true Day. So whoever wills may take to his Lord a place of return. Indeed, We have warned you of an imminent punishment. The Day a man will see what his hands have put forth, and the disbeliever will say, “Oh, I wish I were dust.”
79:1-5	And those who pull out drowningly, and those who activate actively, and those who swim swimmingly, and those who race, and those who manage affairs.
79:6-14	The Day the mighty earthquake quakes, followed by another. On that Day hearts will be trembling, their eyes will be downcast. They will say, “Are we really going to be returned to the grave?” “Are we then [now] rotten bones?” They will say, “That then is a losing return.” But it will be only one blast. Then at once they are in the watchful eye.
79:15-26	"Has there reached you the story of Moses? When his Lord called to him in the sacred valley of Tuwa, ""Go to Pharaoh, indeed he has transgressed. And say, 'Would you like to be purified? And I will guide you to your Lord so that you may fear Him.'"" So he showed him the greatest sign. But he denied and disobeyed. Then he turned back, running. Then he was gathered together and called out. He said, ""I am your lord, the most high."" So Allah seized him with the punishment of the Hereafter and of this world. Indeed in that is a lesson for whoever fears."
79:27-33	Are you more difficult to create or is the heaven which He constructed? He raised its ceiling and proportioned it. And He made its night dark and brought forth its brightness. And after that He spread out the earth. He brought forth from it its water and its pasture. And the mountains He fixed firmly. As provision for you and your livestock.
79:34-41	Then, when the greatest disaster comes, the Day when man will remember what he strove for, and Hellfire will be made visible to all who see. But as for he who transgressed and preferred the life of this world, then Hellfire will be his refuge. But as for he who feared the position of his Lord and prevented himself from desire, then Paradise will be his refuge.
79:42-46	They ask you about the Hour: when will it come to pass? What do you have to say about its remembrance? To your Lord is its destination. You are only a warner for those who fear it. On the Day they see it, it will be as if they had not remained [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morning thereof.
80:1-16	He frowned and turned away. Because the blind man came to him. And what do you know? Perhaps he will be purified or will be reminded and the reminder will benefit him. As for he who is self-sufficient, you attend to him. And there is no blame upon you if he does not purify. But as for he who comes to you striving while he fears, you are distracted from him. No! It is only a reminder, so whoever wills may remember it. It is in honored pages, raised up and purified, in the hands of scribes, noble and righteous.
80:17-23	Man, how ungrateful he is! From what was he created? From a sperm-drop He created him and proportioned him. Then He made the way easy for him. Then He caused him to die and placed him in the grave. Then, when He wills, He will resurrect him. No! He has not yet accomplished what he was commanded.
80:24-32	Let man consider his food. We poured down water in torrents. Then We split the earth open and produced therein grain, grapes and herbage, olives and palm trees, and dense gardens, fruits and pastures, for provision for you and your livestock.
80:33-42	Then, when there comes the Deafening Blast, the Day a man will flee from his brother, and his mother, and his father, and his wife, and his children. Every man, that Day, will have enough to make him indifferent to others. Some faces, that Day, will be radiant, laughing and rejoicing. Some faces, that Day, will be covered with dust, darkness will cover them. Those are the disbelievers, the wicked.
81:1-14	When the sun is rolled up. And when the stars are scattered. And when the mountains are set in motion. And when the tenth-year-olds are neglected. And when the wild beasts are herded together. And when the seas are set on fire. And when the souls are paired. And when the girl buried alive is asked, For what sin was she killed? And when the pages are spread out. And when the sky is scraped open. And when Hell is set ablaze. And when Paradise is brought near. Every soul will know what it has brought.
81:15-25	So I swear by the stars that recede, by the night when it darkens, by the morning when it breathes, that it is the word of an honored Messenger, possessing power with the Lord of the Throne, secure, obeyed and trustworthy. And your companion is not mad. He has certainly seen him on the clear horizon. And he is not a miser, of the unseen. And it is not the word of an accursed devil.
81:26-29	So where are you going? It is only a reminder to the worlds, for whoever among you wills to go straight. And you do not will except that Allah, Lord of the worlds, wills.
82:1-5	When the sky is split open. When the stars are scattered. When the seas are made to gush forth. When the graves are scattered. Every soul will know what it has put forward and what it has left behind.
82:6-8	O man, what has deceived you concerning your Lord, the Generous? He who created you, proportioned you, and balanced you. In whatever form He willed He assembled you.
82:9-12	No! Rather, you deny the Judgment. And indeed, over you are keepers, noble and recording. They know whatever you do.
82:13-19	Indeed, the righteous will be in bliss. And indeed, the wicked will be in Hellfire. They will enter it on the Day of Judgment, and they will not be absent from it. And what will make you know what is the Day of Judgment? And what will make you know what is the Day of Judgment? The Day when no soul will possess anything for another soul, and the command that Day will be to God.
83:1-6	Woe to those who give less [than their due]! Who, when they take by measure from people, take in full, but when they give by measure or weight to others, give less [than their due]. Do they not think that they will be resurrected for a tremendous Day - the Day when mankind will stand before the Lord of the worlds?
83:7-17	"No! Indeed, the book of the wicked is in Sijjin. And what can make you know what is Sijjin? It is a book inscribed. Woe, that Day, to the deniers - Who deny the Day of Judgment. And none denies it except every transgressor, sinful one. When Our verses are recited to him, he says, ""Legends of the former peoples."" No! Rather, the stain has covered their hearts of that which they used to earn. No! Indeed, they will be veiled from their Lord that Day. Then they will be roasting in Hell. Then it will be said, ""This is what you used to deny."""
83:18-28	No! The record of the righteous is in ‘Illiyun. And what can make you know what is ‘Illiyun? It is a book inscribed. Those brought near (to Allah) witness it. Indeed, the righteous will be in pleasure. Relying on couches, they observe. You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure. They will be given to drink of a sealed wine, whose seal is musk, and for this let the competitors compete. And its mixture is of Tasnim, a spring from which those brought near (to Allah) will drink.
83:29-36	"Indeed, those who committed crimes used to laugh at those who believed. And when they passed by them, they would wink at one another. And when they returned to their families, they returned joking. And when they saw them, they said, ""Indeed, these are the ones who have gone astray."" And they were not sent over them as guardians. So today those who believed are laughing at the disbelievers. On couches, observing. Is the cover of the disbelievers for what they used to do?"
84:1-5	When the heaven is split open and obeys its Lord, and it is right. And when the earth is spread out and casts out what is within it and becomes empty, and obeys its Lord, and it is right.
84:6-15	O mankind, indeed you are striving toward your Lord with exertion and will meet Him. But as for he who is given his record in his right hand - he will be judged with an easy reckoning. And he will return to his family, rejoicing. But as for he who is given his record behind his back - he will cry out for destruction and will enter a Blaze. Indeed, he was among his family, rejoicing. Indeed, he thought that he would never return. But indeed, his Lord was ever, of him, Seeing.
84:16-25	So I swear by the twilight, and by the night and what it covers, and by the moon when it is full, that you will surely ride, stage after stage. So what is the matter with them that they do not believe? And when the Qur’an is recited to them, they do not prostrate. Rather, those who disbelieve deny. And Allah is most knowing of what they perceive. So give them tidings of a painful punishment, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - for them is a reward uninterrupted.
85:1-9	By the sky with its constellations. And the Promised Day. And a witness and what is witnessed. Killing the companions of the trench. The fire fueled. When they were sitting by it. And they were witnesses to what they were doing to the believers. And they did not resent them except because they believed in God, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy. To Him belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. And God is, over all things, Witness.
85:10-11	Indeed, those who have persecuted believing men and believing women and then have not repented will have the punishment of Hell, and they will have the punishment of the Burning Fire. Indeed, those who have believed and done righteous deeds will have gardens beneath which rivers flow. That is the great attainment.
85:12-16	Indeed, the punishment of your Lord is severe. Indeed, it is He who begins and repeats. And He is the Forgiving, the Loving. Possessor of the Throne, the Glorious. Doer of whatever He wills.
85:17-22	Has there come to you the story of the soldiers? Pharaoh and Thamud. But those who disbelieve are in denial. And Allah is behind them encompassing. Rather, it is a glorious Qur'an, In a Preserved Tablet.
86:1-4	By the sky and the Nightcomer. And what can make you know what is the Nightcomer? It is the piercing star. Indeed, every soul has a guardian over it.
86:5-10	So let man consider from what he was created. He was created from a fluid ejected. It proceeds from between the backbone and the ribs. Indeed, He is Able to return him. On the Day when secrets will be exposed, he will have neither power nor helper.
86:11-17	By the sky with its recurring paths. And the earth with its cracks. Indeed, it is a decisive statement, and it is not a joke. Indeed, they are plotting a plot. And I am plotting a plot. So grant respite to the disbelievers. Grant them respite a little.
87:1-5	Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High. Who created and proportioned. Who determined and guided. Who brought forth the pasture and made it dark stubble.
87:6-13	We will make you recite, and you will not forget. Except what Allah wills. Indeed, He knows what is declared and what is hidden. And We will ease you toward ease. So remind, if the reminder should benefit. He who fears will remember. And the most wretched will avoid it - who will enter the Great Fire. Then he will neither die therein nor live.
87:14-19	He has succeeded who purifies himself, remembers the name of his Lord, and prays. But you prefer the life of this world, while the Hereafter is better and more lasting. Indeed, this is in the former scriptures - the scriptures of Abraham and Moses.
88:1-7	Has there come to you the news of the Overwhelming Event? Some faces, that Day, will be humbled, toiling, exhausted. They will be burned in a blazing Fire, given to drink from a boiling spring. They will have no food except from a thorny shrub called Dir' (a tree that neither nourishes nor relieves hunger).
88:8-16	On that Day, faces will be radiant, pleased with their efforts. In a lofty garden. Therein you will hear no idle talk. Therein will be a flowing spring. Therein will be raised couches, and cups set forth, and cushions lined up, and carpets spread out.
88:17-20	Do they not look at the camels - how they are created? And at the sky - how it is raised? And at the mountains - how they are erected? And at the earth - how it is spread out?
88:21-26	So remind, for you are only a reminder. You are not a controller over them - Except for he who turns away and disbelieves. Then Allah will punish him with the greatest punishment. Indeed, to Us is their return. Then indeed, upon Us is their account.
89:1-14	By the dawn. And ten nights. And the even and the odd. And the night when it departs. Is there in that an oath for one of sense? Have you not considered how your Lord dealt with the ‘Ad? Iram, who had lofty pillars, the like of which had never been created in the land. And Thamud, who hewed out the rocks in the valley. And Pharaoh, who had the stakes, who transgressed in the land and spread corruption therein. So your Lord poured down upon them a scourge of punishment. Indeed, your Lord is ever watchful.
89:15-20	"But as for man, when his Lord tests him and honors him and blesses him, he says, ""My Lord has honored me."" But when He tests him and restricts his provision, he says, ""My Lord has humiliated me."" No! Rather, you do not honor the orphan. Nor do you encourage one another to feed the poor. You consume inheritance, devouring [it] completely. And you love wealth excessively."
89:21-30	"No! When the earth is pounded to powder, pounded to powder, and your Lord comes with angels, rank upon rank. And that Day Hell is brought forth. That Day man will remember - but how will remembrance succeed him? He will say, ""Oh, would that I had sent forth [a message] for my life."" That Day no one will punish as He punishes, nor will anyone bind as He binds. O reassured soul, return to your Lord, well-pleased and pleasing [to Him], and enter among My [righteous] servants. And enter My Paradise."
90:1-4	I swear by this land, and you are a resident of this land, and a father and what he begot. Indeed, We created man into hardship.
90:5-10	"Does he think that no one has power over him? He says, ""I have wasted wealth forever."" Does he think that no one sees him? Have We not made for him two eyes, a tongue, and two lips, and shown him the two ways?"
90:11-20	So do not rush through the steep path. And what can make you know what is the steep path? It is the freeing of a slave. Or the feeding on a day of severe hunger. An orphan near of kin. Or a needy person covered with dust. Then he was among those who believed and advised each other to patience and advised each other to compassion. Those are the companions of the right. But those who disbelieved in Our verses - they are the companions of the left. Upon them is a Fire closed.
91:1-10	By the sun and its brightness. And the moon when it follows it. And the day when it displays it. And the night when it covers it. And the heaven and He who constructed it. And the earth and He who spread it out. And the soul and He who proportioned it. And inspired it with [discernment of] wickedness and [with] righteousness. He has succeeded who purifies it. And he has failed who instills it with corruption.
91:11-15	Thamud denied it in their transgression. When their most wretched one arose, the Messenger of God said to them, “The she-camel of God and her watering place.” But they denied him and hamstrung her. So their Lord destroyed them for their sin and leveled them. And He does not fear its consequences.
92:1-7	By the night when it covers, And by the day when it appears, And by Him who created the male and the female. Indeed, your efforts are diverse. But as for him who gives and fears Allah, And believes in the best [reward] - We will ease him toward ease.
92:8-11	But as for him who withholds and considers himself free of need and denies the best reward, We will ease him toward difficulty. But his wealth will not avail him when he falls.
92:12-21	Indeed, upon Us is guidance. And indeed, to Us are the Hereafter and the first [life]. So I have warned you of a blazing Fire. None shall enter it except the most wretched - who denied and turned away. And the most righteous will avoid it - who gives his wealth to purify himself. And no one has with him any favor for which he shall be rewarded - Except seeking the countenance of his Lord, the Most High. And he is going to be satisfied.
93:1-5	By the forenoon. And by the night when it covers with darkness. Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor has He detested you. And the Hereafter is better for you than the first [life]. And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied.
93:6-11	Did He not find you an orphan and give you shelter? And He found you lost and guided you? And He found you poor and made you rich? But as for the orphan, do not oppress him. And as for the beggar, do not repel him. And as for the favor of your Lord, proclaim it.
94:1-4	Have We not expanded your breast for you? And removed from you your burden which weighed upon your back? And raised high for you your repute?
94:5-8	Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease. Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease. So when you have finished, then strive [to do good], and to your Lord direct your longing.
95:1-6	By the fig and the olive, and Mount Sinai, and this secure city. Indeed, We created man in the best stature; then We return him to the lowest of the low, except for those who believe and do righteous deeds - for they will have a reward uninterrupted.
95:7-8	So what makes you deny the religion after that? Is not Allah the best of judges?
96:1-5	Read in the name of your Lord who created. Created man from a clot. Read, and your Lord is the Most Generous. Who taught by the pen. Taught man that which he knew not.
96:6-8	No indeed, man transgresses because he sees himself self-sufficient. Indeed, to your Lord is the return.
96:9-19	Have you seen him who forbids. A servant when he prays? Have you seen if he is on guidance? Or enjoins righteousness? Have you seen if he lies and turns away? Does he not know that Allah sees? No! If he does not desist, We will surely drag him by the forelock. A lying, sinful forelock. So let him call his group. We will call the guards of Hell. No! Do not obey him, but prostrate and draw near.
97:1-5	Indeed, We sent it down during the Night of Decree. And what can make you know what is the Night of Decree? The Night of Decree is better than a thousand months. The angels and the Spirit descend therein by permission of their Lord for every matter. Peace it is until the emergence of dawn.
98:1-5	Those who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists would not cease [from [disbelief] until there came to them clear evidence - a Messenger from Allah reciting purified pages in which were valuable scriptures. And those who were given the Scripture did not become divided until there came to them clear evidence. And they were commanded not except to worship Allah, devoting to Him religion, being true [in faith], and to establish prayer and to give zakah. And that is the right religion.
98:6-8	Indeed, those who disbelieve among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the Fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creation. Indeed, those who believe and do righteous deeds - those are the best of creation. Their reward with their Lord is Gardens of Eden beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him. That is for whoever fears his Lord.
99:1-8	"When the earth is shaken with its [final] earthquake And the earth discharges its burdens And man says, ""What is [wrong] with it?"" That Day it will declare its news Because your Lord has inspired it. That Day mankind will come forth in separate groups to be seen for what they did. So whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it. And whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it."
100:1-5	By the charging horses, panting, By those striking sparks of fire, By those making a dawn raid, And raising up thereby dust, And driving into the midst of an army.
100:6-11	Indeed, man is ungrateful to his Lord. And indeed, he is, to that, a witness. And indeed, he is intense in his love of good. Does he not know when that which is in the graves is scattered and that which is in the breasts is exposed? Indeed, their Lord, that Day, is Acquainted with them.
101:1-5	The Calamity. What is the Calamity? And what can make you know what the Calamity is? The Day when people will be like scattered moths, and the mountains will be like carded wool.
101:6-11	But as for he whose scales are heavy, he will be in a pleasant life. But as for he whose scales are light, his mother will be the pit. And what can make you know what it is? A blazing Fire.
102:1-4	You are distracted by multiplying [things], until you visit the graves. No, you will surely know. Then no, you will surely know.
102:5-8	No, if you only knew with certainty, you would see Hell. Then you will see it with certainty. Then you will be asked that Day about pleasure.
103:1-3	By time. Indeed, mankind is in loss, Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.
104:1-9	Woe to every slanderer and backbiter. Who hoards wealth and counts it. Thinks that his wealth will make him immortal. No! He will surely be thrown into the Crusher. And what can make you know what is the Crusher? It is the Fire of Allah, kindled, Which ascends to the hearts. It is locked upon them, On extended pillars.
105:1-5	Have you not seen how your Lord dealt with the companions of the elephant? Did He not make their plot go astray? And He sent against them birds in flocks, striking them with stones of baked clay. And He made them like eaten straw.
106:1-4	For the mutual security of the Quraysh. Their mutual security for the winter and summer journeys. So let them worship the Lord of this House, Who has fed them against hunger and made them safe from fear.
107:1-3	Have you seen him who denies the Recompense? He is the one who drives away the orphan and does not encourage the feeding of the poor.
107:4-7	Woe to those who pray, but are heedless of their prayer, who are hypocrites, and who withhold provision.
108:1-3	Indeed, We have granted you, [O Muhammad], al-Kawthar. So pray to your Lord and sacrifice. Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off.
109:1-6	"Say, ""O disbelievers! I do not worship what you worship. Nor will you worship what I worship. Nor will I worship what you worship. Nor will you worship what I worship. To you be your religion, and to me mine."""
110:1-3	When the help of Allah and the conquest come, and you see the people entering the religion of Allah in multitudes, then exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord and seek His forgiveness. Indeed, He is ever Accepting of repentance.
111:1-5	Perish the hands of Abu Lahab, and perish he! His wealth will not avail him, nor will he earn it. He will burn in a blazing Fire. And his wife, the carrier of firewood, will have a rope of palm fiber around her neck.
112:1-4	Say, “He is God, the One. God, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born. And there is none comparable to Him.”
113:1-5	"Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of the daybreak. From the evil of that which He created. And from the evil of darkness when it settles. And from the evil of those who blow on knots. And from the evil of an envier when he envies."""
114:1-6	"Say, ""I seek refuge in the Lord of mankind, the King of mankind, the God of mankind, from the evil of the retreating whisperer, Who whispers in the hearts of mankind - from among jinn and mankind."""
